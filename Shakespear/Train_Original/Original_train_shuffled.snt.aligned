Your Majesty, hear now, saving your Majesty’s manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy knave it is.
Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquess of Montferrat? 
Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds.
It is his.
I warrant thee.
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
For my part, I care not.
Look, here comes a walking fire.
I’ll make so bold to call, For ’tis my limited service.
Yes, I am.
I am sorry For your displeasure, but all will sure be well.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.
Tis noble Kent, your friend.
I will not hold thee long.
Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursèd in the calendar!

The same.
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed.
She made good view of me, indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly.
That shows thou art unconfirmed.
God’s benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes.
I am called.
True, my lord.
Follow, follow!
But tell me true, are you not mad indeed?
She will sit you—you heard my daughter tell you how.
What, man, courage yet!
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
My lord, you know I love you.
If you be gentlemen, Do me this right: hear me with patience.
To bed?
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.
Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.

How is ’t with you?
And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged, That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.

If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
Not I, I must be found.
Good morrow, Brutus.
And when goes hence?
Good love, call him back.
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay, Who twice a day their withered hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood.
There was a noise, That’s verily.
Welcome, my friends all.
Draw the curtains—so, so, so.
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today.
Will you mock at an ancient tradition begun upon an honorable respect and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valor, and dare not avouch in your deeds any of your words?
Bear it straight, And bring thy master home immediately.
I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dressed together.
O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
See better, Lear, and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye.
All my reports go with the modest truth, Nor more, nor clipped, but so.
Twas a fault unwilling.
This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
Whither away?
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne?
Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
Demetrius thinks not so.
Now, Roderigo, Where didst thou see her?—Oh, unhappy girl!— With the Moor, say’st thou?—Who would be a father?— How didst thou know ’twas she?—Oh, she deceives me Past thought!—What said she to you?—Get more tapers, Raise all my kindred.
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and mother.
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry.
Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.
Again!
Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation.
Madam, not now.
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.
I am not such an ass, but I can keep my hand dry.
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming?
Tis pity that thou liv’st To walk where any honest men resort.
Do, do.
The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night.
For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long, It shall be his.
Here comes Kent.
If you prove a mutineer, the next tree.
If one knight give a— Would you have a love song or a song of good life?
Thou didst smile Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven, When I have decked the sea with drops full salt, Under my burthen groaned; which raised in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue.
Tell me at whose suit.
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate, And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates.
Wouldst thou give 'em all?
May I know?
Drown thyself?
And so of men.
Nor I neither, by this heavenly light.
Why, ’tis not possible.
They are pitiful.

Or blessè was ’t we did?

But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless.
I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom.
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.
I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently.
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Death and damnation!
Why, how now, Kate!
Do you intend it?
Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town, Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, And then return and sleep within mine inn, For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Since the youth of the count’s was today with thy lady, she is much out of quiet.
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?
Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make ’s love known?
Here comes one o' the parings.
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon, Be it lawful I take up what’s cast away.
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.
In such a night as this!
And I have met a gentleman Hath promised me to help me to another, A fine musician to instruct our mistress.
Filths savor but themselves.
Wouldst thou betray me?
Even he, sir.
I pray you, let me see it.
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear.
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus, To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.
Fare thee well.
What art thou?
Hence “banishèd” is banished from the world, And world’s exile is death.
Your Highness bade me ask for it today.
You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance.
It was ourself thou didst abuse.
Retire we to our chamber.
Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
Yet again?
So get you hence in peace.
No doubt, no doubt.
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo.
Friend Launcelot, what’s the news?
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
Sojourn in Mantua.
Grieved I I had but one?
She shall, Lucentio.

Bear with him, Brutus.
Kiss him for that, good widow.

Unfold it.
Not I but my affairs have made you wait.
That was in thy rage.
I will this night, In several hands, in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at.
Here comes the lady.
Pursue him and entreat him to a peace.
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
No, we’ll reason with him.
Tis like a demi-cannon.
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.
A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard.
So is Lysander.
Will it be ever thus?
To that end, As matching to his youth and vanity, I did present him with the Paris balls.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
So do I ever  For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
Tell him I’ll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy’s day.
Thou told’st me they were stol'n unto this wood.
What o' that?
This cannot be, By no assay of reason.
By my hand I swear, and my father’s soul, the work ish ill done.
What, dead, my dove?
Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid’s archery, Sink in apple of his eye.
Be certain, nothing truer.
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.
Why, this is not Lear.
But truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
Faith, that was not so well.
And will she yet abase her eyes on me, That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed?
Happier than this— She is not bred so dull but she can learn.
You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
O excellent motion!
Drones hive not with me.
I have no hope That he’s undrowned.
Because, look you, you do not love it, nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it, I would desire you to eat it. 
Ay, madam.
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, Nor no such men as you have reckoned up, As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece, And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell, And twenty more such names and men as these, Which never were, nor no man ever saw.
Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
You look angerly.
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar, Where is my lady’s lord?
I pray you, look upon her.
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
And art thou living, Stephano?
He is very busy about it.
Her name, that was as fresh As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face.
Is he arrayed?
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Is ’t lost?
Hath she forgot already that brave prince, Edward, her lord, whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury?
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
First, as you know, my house within the city Is richly furnishèd with plate and gold, Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry, In ivory coffers I have stuffed my crowns, In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, Fine linen, Turkey cushions bossed with pearl, Valance of Venice gold in needlework, Pewter and brass, and all things that belong To house or housekeeping.
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
How is ’t with you, my most fair Bianca?
Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.
That’s my noble master!
Stay, countrymen.
As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen.
Therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head.
I have professed me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness.
Alas, he is betrayed and I undone.
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason?
I am even The natural fool of fortune.
Well, I would you did like me.
Prepare we for our marriage; on which day, My Lord of Burgundy, we’ll take your oath, And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
Madam, I will.
Give me the letter, sir.
Silenced with that, In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day, He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, Strange images of death.
No, my profound heart.
Ah, he is young, and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, A man that loves not me nor none of you.
Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o'er the house.
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men?
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
I’ll be at thy elbow.
All things that are, Are with more spirit chasèd than enjoyed.
Why dost thou lash that whore?
I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up, Upon a sore injunction.
Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading?
I know this is a joyful trouble to you, But yet ’tis one.
What will hap more tonight, safe ’scape the king!
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
Away with him.
O Regan, she hath tied Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here.
Stay, I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
I never did deny it.
In my chamber window lies a book.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
Either thou, Macbeth, Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded.
A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.
Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
Peace, ho, for shame!
Sneck up!
Dear lady, welcome home.
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit, For ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned.
And came I not at last to comfort you?
I say, remember.
Your Grace does me as great honors as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects.
Then say at once what is it thou requests.
Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.
No man must know.” What follows?
Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy.
So, thanks to all at once and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.
Then weep no more.
Nay, I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.
Saw you anything?
Well, do it, and be brief.
He’s gone, but his wife’s killed.
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine, Seem frosty?
I told him you were sick.
False to me?
Good signors both, when shall we laugh?
What dost thou say?
The note lies in ’s throat, if he say I said so.  
They would not have you to stir forth today.
The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more.

Before the time I did Lysander see Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in!
Or if it did not, Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were, As living here and you no use of him.
The dropsy drown this fool!
Gratiano!
Yea, art thou there?
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood, Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
Sure, ’tis not so.
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
And all my armor laid into my tent?
Why, she is within.
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
In the wars.
Fly hence and leave me.
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
He hath the falling sickness.
Keep promise, love.
In the street I met him, And in his company that gentleman.
I did so, and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting.
What if it come to thee again?
I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs.
The near in blood, The nearer bloody.
Belike you slew great number of his people?
My Regan counsels well.
There’s matter in ’t indeed, if he be angry.
Who hath sent thee now?
Nay, forward, old man.
The weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.— Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!
We’ll mutiny.
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
My niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valor.
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

Some such squire he was That turned your wit the seamy side without And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
Tyranny is dead!
He cannot be such a monster— Nor is not, sure.
Ay, widow Dido.
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs.
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or, like to men proud of destruction, Defy us to our worst.
Officers, what offense have these men done?
For, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
But, look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train.
Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.
Do not you love me?

If they will fight with us, bid them come down, Or void the field.
When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?
If ’twere no other— 'Tis but so, I warrant.
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same.
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations.
Why do you speak so faintly?
Old Cassius still.
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.
To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.
I have brought him a present.
What’s the matter?

Or did the letters work upon his blood And new-create his fault?
Farewell, my lord.
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
Yare, lower, lower!
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I’ll cry a match.
Make those that do offend you suffer too.
My lord, whoever journeys to the prince, For God’s sake let not us two at home.
But speak you this with a sad brow?
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th' effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person, kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction.
Richard loves Richard; that is, I and I.
Therefore, good Emilia, Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
I have an humor to knock you indifferently well.
What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead.

Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.
I care not.
Well, sir, I’ll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him.
Ho, now you strike like the blind man.
It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness!

The several messengers From hence attend dispatch.
Chill pick your teeth, zir.
No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.

And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell, That men shall swear I have discontinued school Above a twelvemonth.

No, great king.
A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
Sir, I have not you by the hand.
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.
I would have all well betwixt you.
Away!
I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
Who hath made this havoc with them?
I' th' clout, i' th' clout.
O dear!
Come, Vaughan.

Which is that adversary?
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.
O Stephano, hast any more of this?
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face!
Ay, and Wall too.
By my life, I do.
Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent.
Adieu.
Are not you he?

Light, I say, light!
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.
He dies!
What harmony is this?
The king’s son have I landed by himself, Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot.
He is no less than a stuffed man.
We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible.
What, my dear Lady Disdain!
Unbutton here.
Let me but move one question to your daughter, And by that fatherly and kindly power That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
Why call you me “love”?
His daughters seek his death.
O my brother’s child!
You must have patience, madam.
But notwithstanding, haste.
And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.
But who comes here?
Our brother is imprisoned by your means, Myself disgraced, and the nobility Held in contempt, while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
The Duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own.
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety.
My child is yet a stranger in the world.
Come on, to ’t.
Or did I dream it so?
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

Now know you, Casca, I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence.
Poor heart, adieu.
Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife.
Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
O sweet bully Bottom!
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou'rt poor enough.
My dearest coz, I pray you school yourself.
A beggar, brother?
Be ruled by me.
Take note, take note, O world, To be direct and honest is not safe.
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners.
That’s not the tune.
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires, Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head!
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that color.
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
But thou'rt too much my friend, And I’ll not wish thee to her.
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober.
I am Christophero Sly.
The motion’s good indeed and be it so.— Petruchio, I shall be your 
To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
Oh, that she knew she were!
The handkerchief!
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
My cousin Westmoreland?
What a thrice-double ass Was I, to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool!
I am your neighbor, and was suitor first.
I’ll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy.
No, It is thyself, mine own self’s better part, Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart, My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim, My sole earth’s heaven, and my heaven’s claim.
Why comest thou?

That is the voice, Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
Farewell.
There would this monster make a man.
I say my daughter is my flesh and blood.
By day and night he wrongs me.
And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath.
Well, here’s my comfort.
It is very true.
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare, Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I; I for a Clarence weep; so doth not she.
Fear nothing.
I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest.
What a long night is this!
And you shall be satisfied.
By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world.
Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
The mercy that was quick in us but late By your own counsel is suppressed and killed.
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.
How?
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
My sword, I say!
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant, She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking.
Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon.
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?
It hangs like flax on a distaff.
He did, and from my finger snatched that ring.
Ay, and briefly.
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
This is his second fit.
I shall do’t, my lord.
Don Pedro is approached.
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale, and safety.
Would that fault were mine!
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
Verona, for a while I take my leave, To see my friends in Padua, but of all My best belovèd and approvèd friend, Hortensio.
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk— Ratcliffe, thyself, or Catesby.
No more!
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
Belike this is a man of that quirk.
What cheer, my love?— Demetrius and Egeus, go along.
Kind and dear princess!
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power.
The Lord Mayor knocks.
He hath no daughters, sir.
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.— Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.
Shall Kate be my wife?
Killing swine.
An you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend.
A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters.
Honest Iago Hath ta'en order for ’t.
What paper were you reading?
Would it were mortal poison for thy sake.
I know his heart.

Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor.
This feather stirs.
Grandam, his nurse.
Till then, think of the world.
What hast thou found?
None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing, Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
Anything that’s mended is but patched.
Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped.
Did this companion with the saffron face Revel and feast it at my house today Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut And I denied to enter in my house?
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great, reasonable great.
O valiant cousin!
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition, To be so baited, scorned, and stormèd at.
Yet here’s a spot.
Dromio, nor thou?
The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends.
Buy food, and get thyself in flesh.— Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.

Now, for my life, she’s wandering to the Tower, On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender prince.— Daughter, well met.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow That never words were music to thine ear, That never object pleasing in thine eye, That never touch well welcome to thy hand, That never meat sweet-savored in thy taste, Unless I spake, or looked, or touched, or carved to thee.
What then?
Oh, heavy ignorance!
I am an ass, I am a woman’s man, and besides myself.
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, The spirit-stirring drum, th' ear-piercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality, Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
You sent me for a rope’s end as soon.

Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends, And there an end.
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
I have, when you have heard what I can say.
Tis time I should inform thee farther.
If I could make that resemble something in me—Softly!
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
I, as I may—that which I would I cannot,— With best advantage will deceive the time, And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms.
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us.
Captain Macmorris, when there is more better opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war, and there is an end.

Alas now, pray you, Work not so hard.
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy, Lightens my humor with his merry jests.

Why, go to then.
Give me.

I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
What, has his daughters brought him to this pass?— Couldst thou save nothing?
At a word, I am not.
Do not you chide.
Go get it ready.
But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world.
Get thee away.
So bless thee, master.
Go and tell them so.
Look, where she comes.
He is sure possessed, madam.
Full half an hour.
Come forth.
Now all the blessings Of a glad father, compass thee about.
Remember our reward when the deed’s done.
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs.
Edmund is dead, my lord.
Mistress,  Wilt thou still talk?
About it, and write “happy” when thou’st done.
Ay, my good lord.
Fall and cease.
Go bring the rabble, O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place.
If thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.
That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in.
I’ll be with thee straight.
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
I have many enemies in Orsino’s court, Else would I very shortly see thee there.
Hail to thee, lady, and the grace of heaven, Before, behind thee, and on every hand, Enwheel thee round!
No, to Whitefriars.
Any strange beast there makes a man.
Oh, fie upon thee, strumpet!
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
Yours, if you talk of tales.
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
To ’t, luxury, pell-mell—for I lack soldiers. 
Let me see the caper.
Cassio shall have my place.
Witness you That he is borne about invisible.
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
What is your tidings?
Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love.
Grumio, my horse.
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Do me the favour to dilate at full What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
Oh, the more angel she, And you the blacker devil!
And is it physical To walk unbracèd and suck up the humors Of the dank morning?
Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all.—He wakes.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.
This falls out better than I could devise.
What, my gracious lord?
Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay, For he is footed in this land already.
What is the matter here?
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
It is so.
Where America, the Indies?
Oh, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles, That quicken even with blowing.
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
Sweet Prince, why speak not you?
Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come, You might have heard it else proclaimed about.
As thick as tale Can post with post, and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense, And poured them down before him.
So I to her and so she yields to me, For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
Michael, good night.
Why, so didst thou.
I know this, and thus I challenge it.
She must change for youth.
I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes.
Peace!
With drinking healths to my niece.
Let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our children, and our sins lay on the king!
Where is the Master, Boatswain?
I cry thee mercy, then, for I did think That thou hadst called me all these bitter names.
Forget to think of her.
And so falls it out With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so ’twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I, who, as thou know’st, are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
Oh, look!
Away with the dotard!
The devil speaks in him.
Give him direction for this merry bond, And I will go and purse the ducats straight, See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave, and presently I will be with you.
For my dinner.
If I let him go, The debt he owes will be required of me.
Mark it, nuncle.
A most miraculous work in this good king, Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do.
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
Leave me, Iago.
If I think so, I think the same of you.
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this county.
I am bound to the Count Orsino’s court.
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape.— Take with you your companions.
Methinks I do.
Is there any ships put forth tonight?
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A huswife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes.
No, truly.
Ah me!
A very handsome man.
Follow, and see there be no harm between them.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
You kiss by th' book.
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty.
For no kind of traffic Would I admit.
Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters. 
Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer, Only reserved their factor to buy souls And send them thither.
You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
I cannot love him.
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis, So is she heir of Naples, ’twixt which regions There is some space.
The voice of Cassio.
Why then, lead on.
His name’s Cinna.
I have slept, my lord, already.
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she’s in love with him.
Come, shall we about it?
Away!
The sooner, sweet, for you.
Thou shalt not lose by it.
And so will I.
Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!
Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.
Is he come?
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
Go to, you are too shrewd.
I will tell you everything, right as it fell out.
I would have sworn it had, my lord, especially against Benedick.
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
Why, then, some be of laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
Adieu, be vigitant, I beseech you.
Come, sir, away.
Know’st thou Gower?
Why then, thus it is: You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
Caesar, I will.
I find not Myself disposed to sleep.
If your Majesties is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps, which, your Majesty know, to this hour is an honorable badge of the service.
Be wise, and get you home.
But soft, I pray you.
Excellent good, i' faith.
Sblood, an arrant traitor as any ’s in the universal world, or in France, or in England!
Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.
I will hear further reason for this.
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be.
Do not you meddle.
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.
Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice and cry “So, so!” Each one, tripping on his toe,
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
But Macbeth is.
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
There’s not a piece of feather in our host— Good argument, I hope, we will not fly— And time hath worn us into slovenry.
Do but look up.
Trail’st thou the puissant pike?
No, ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door, but ’tis enough, ’twill serve.
It is the more like to be feigned.
Dull thing, I say so.
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
My brother hath a daughter, Almost the copy of my child that’s dead, And she alone is heir to both of us.
Nay, faith, let me not play a woman.
Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk.
And from thy hated presence part I so.
But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love.
It cannot be.
Give me thy hand, Messala.
If thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.
And, good night, sweet friend.
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman, Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter.
Well then, now Have you considered of my speeches?
Half-blooded fellow, yes.
Ay, so I thought.
It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward.
Great thing of us forgot!— Speak, Edmund, where’s the king?
And then the moon, like to a silver bow New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.
We say the king Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
The earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment— Good Captain Blunt, bear my goodnight to him, And by the second hour in the morning Desire the earl to see me in my tent.
God bless your Grace with health and happy days.
Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.
Oh, he hath murdered his master!
Therefore let Benedick, like covered fire, Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.
Come, put mine armor on.
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Where did you leave him?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe.
I humbly thank you for’t.
Good.
I think it is not meet Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar.
Not life, but love in death.
What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true love take.
I drew to part them.
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth.
Lead, monster; we’ll follow.
Here comes my lady.
And so doth mine.
So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun, King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim, King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear To hold in right and title of the female.
Stay yet.
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
O Bottom, thou art changed!
A monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.
A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.
What, lamb!
How, how I pray you?
The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
Nor know I aught But that he’s well and will be shortly here.
My industrious servant, Ariel!
Is he come home yet?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday.
No.
Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say, “Lo, there is mad Petruchio’s wife, If it would please him come and marry her!”   Upon my life, Petruchio means but well, Whatever fortune stays him from his word: Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise; Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.
What thinkest thou of his opinion?
Wilt come?
The king and prince at prayers.
Let them come before Master Constable.
How does my royal lord?
We here attend you.
Come.
Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!
All comfort that the dark night can afford Be to thy person, noble father-in-law.
Yea, and paid me richly for the practice of it.
I can tell thee where that saying was born, of “I fear no colors.”  Where, good Mistress Mary?
I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
No, ’tis hereafter to know, but now to promise.
Tis past, and so am I.
We will be married o' Sunday.
O Tranio, till I found it to be true, I never thought it possible or likely.
What’s to say?
What think’st thou?
Here Catesby comes again.
You know I gave it you half an hour since.
But do you hear, sir, have you married my daughter without asking my goodwill?
A friend?
One knocks.
Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.
Well, to our work alive.
Yes, Captain, but with this acknowledgement: That God fought for us.
The very instant that I saw you did My heart fly to your service, there resides To make me slave to it, and for your sake Am I this patient log-man.
Witness, you ever-burning lights above, You elements that clip us round about, Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit, hands, heart, To wronged Othello’s service.
A pestilent gall to me!
I am no child, no babe.
He did command me to call timely on him.
In happy time here comes the duke himself.
Sister, where thou?
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
Wilt thou at Ninny’s tomb meet me straightway?
Have you writ down that they are none?
What, shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes, And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be graspèd thus?
I hold you but a subject of this war, Not as a brother.
To the jail with him!
There’s no true drop of blood in him to be truly touched with love.
When ’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
It is now two o'clock.
There attend my coming.
Your lord does know my mind.
I have a suit to you.
My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that, look your Grace, has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alençon.
You know he does.
Is ’t so, indeed?
These fifteen years!
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on.
You, sir?
That shall you know hereafter.

If in Naples I should report this now, would they believe me?
Is ’t possible?
I do beseech you— Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers— What is your name?
The most you sought was her promotion, For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced.
O sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
Ah, Desdemona, away, away, away!
Where’s my cousin Toby?
Look in my face.
Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better, yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself— A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich— That only to stand high in your account I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends Exceed account.
A sovereign shame so elbows him.
Why did he so?

I will come again.
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.
I think thou art an ass.
Look, he stirs.
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, And in their summer beauty kissed each other.
Why, man, what is the matter?
Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress— Both of one horse?
Abominable villain!
Let us not leave him out.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights, Advance your standards.
Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee?
Follow me, then.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so.
Look, look, a mouse!
For if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her, Thou shalt aby it.
O, know, my name is lost.
I will hear Brutus speak.
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married.
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
Even since you left it.
Now go thy way.
Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell?
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady.

When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
Here comes Lorenzo.
Away, away, for he is coming hither!
Hence, prating peasant!
If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning.
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
What stay had I but Edward?
Ay.
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
Pray you, keep seat.
Come, sir, I will not let you go.
Thou art a fool.
No more amazement.
That’s certain.
I’ll see it done.
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
No, by this heavenly light!
Cupid is a knavish lad  Thus to make poor females mad.
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool.
The desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks, That their designment halts.
I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear!
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
What was it you told me of today, that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signor Benedick?
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure.
Where is Metellus Cimber?
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
Oh, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found “Benedick” and “Beatrice” between the sheet?
Exclaim no more against it.
How lush and lusty the grass looks!
I’ll write straight to my sister To hold my very course.
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, Cry “Caesar!”—Speak.
It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed.
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest; Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.
I’ll assure you, he uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer’s day.
Stand away, Captain Gower.
And, sir, tonight I do entreat that we may sup together.
My noble lord— What dost thou say, Iago?
mutinies, in countries discord, in palaces treason, and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father.
To do what, Signior?
O me, O me!
Is Clarence dead?
You’ll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
Thou dost infect mine eyes.
What is yond gentleman?
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.
We are resolved, my lord.
O happy fair!
I myself could make A chough of as deep chat.
Why are you grown so rude?
I' faith, I thank him.
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper.
I am old and foolish.
But till I come again, No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay, No rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.
Dost thou say so?
Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried.
What do you mean?
Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business.
For God’s sake, send some other messenger.
If you grow foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my rapier, as I may, in fair terms.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come.

Go thou.
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously.
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace.
Why, how now, Stephano?
Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.
An I do not— Come, let’s see the event.
If you knew my business, You would entreat me rather go than stay.
The ways are dangerous.
I hear none, madam.
And we understand him well, How he comes o'er us with our wilder days, Not measuring what use we made of them.
A little, by your favor.

Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too.
O, what cause have I, Thine being but a moiety of my moan, To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!
Oh, my soul’s joy!
Thou'rt a scholar.
Ride, ride, Messala.
Why, what’s the matter?
I say gudday, Captain Fluellen.
It is too true an evil.
A fig!
What kind of woman is’t?
Ay, but he will not now be pacified.
Now your jest is earnest.
My way is now to hie home to his house And tell his wife that, being lunatic, He rushed into my house and took perforce My ring away.
Is that the meaning of “accost”?
Your mind may change.
Fly, my lord, fly.

Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures.
And doth affection breed it?
How now, my sweet Bianca!
She thanked me And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her.
In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.
Where shall we meet i' th' morning?
To thine and Albany’s issue Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter, Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?
But, for true need— You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need.
Neighbors, God speed.
Tomorrow morning come you to my house, And since you could not be my son-in-law, Be yet my nephew.
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Notwithstanding, use your pleasure.

The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase, Even as our days do grow.
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.

Come forth, thou fearful man.
They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them.
The sun!

Stay with us.
The duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintained the pridge.
A piece of ice.
Your worship was wont to tell me that I could do nothing without bidding.
He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip’s bowl, For here we need it not.
Not so, sir, I do care for something.
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits, And give their fasting horses provender, And after fight with them?
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.
My spirits are nimble.
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
Her name is Margery, indeed.
Where we are, There’s daggers in men’s smiles.
Gave it a judge’s clerk!
To bed, to bed.
I dare abide no longer.
Within these two months—that’s a month before This bond expires—I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.
Give me mine armor.
Think on Lord Hastings.
Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched.
O heavens, that such companions thou’dst unfold, And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to th' west!
I have not heard the clock.
Certain ones, then.
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
Nay, come, Kate, come.
But if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
Notable pirate!
I will, my lord.
Stand, ho!
But had he such a chain of thee or no?
What if I strayed no further, but chose here?
A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist.
What is your pleasure, madam?
Oh, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
You say not right, old man.

Even so.
Hear me, good brother— Under your pardon.
Read the will!
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt.
Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him, I' th' afternoon to sleep.
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile.
I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.
This is she—    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Why, so I did, but looked for no reply.
O, preposterous And frantic outrage, end thy damnèd spleen, Or let me die, to look on death no more.
Yea, by Mass, that it is.
Of princes in this number And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead One hundred twenty-six.

What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
Never fear that.
O fortune, fortune!

Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment.
Open your gates.

No words.
Nay, that’s certain.
The table’s full.
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently.

The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, Thy son by this hath married.
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
Rumor it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick.
I hear it by the way; but I will send.
Good night, good night!
Come, hang them on this line.
What sights, my lord?
I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.
Sayest thou so?
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.
Retire thee, go where thou art billeted.

What is this castle called that stands hard by?
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.

Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
I know your favor well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.— Take him away.
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient.
It hath no tongue to vex you.
And be all traitors that do so?
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Brittany, Of Brabant and of Orléans, shall make forth, And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch, To line and new-repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant.
Here, sir!
Apothecary!
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.
Let her alone.
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon, For he was great of heart.
Run away, I pray you!
Did he live now,
This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.
Here’s drink.
Have you no more to say?
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
Look, sir, I bleed.
Will you stay awhile?
Let it be so.
Tom will throw his head at them.—Avaunt, you curs!
I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts, But I beseech your grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

I cry you mercy.
I would your duty were as foolish too.
A kind good night to all!
Ev'n as your horse bears your praises—who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted.
Didst thou see any thing?
Ay, let the county take you in your bed.
But there’s more work.
Of one whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe.
Over hill, over dale,  Thorough bush, thorough brier,  Over park, over pale,  Thorough flood, thorough fire.
More light and light it grows.
As hell, Sir Topas.
Come, come away.
I’ll to the throng.
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
What shall I say?
I am sorry for thee.
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.
Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent?
This would have seemed a period To such as love not sorrow, but another To amplify too much would make much more And top extremity.
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,— And for your Grace, —and yours, my gracious lords.
For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
Stand here, make a good show on ’t.
And what will you do now?
His passport shall be made, And crowns for convoy put into his purse.
Descend.
Stand thee close, then, under this penthouse, for it drizzles rain, and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
Well, I will hie, And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
Sure he hath killed his wife.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
Master Fer.
Look, where he comes.
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
Let me see now,
Go, Sir Andrew.
I cannot tell.
Do you mark that?
O rude unthankfulness!
Skipper, stand back.
I am your own for ever.
Now am I dead.
But if I give my wife a handkerchief— What then?
Why, man, he’s a very devil.
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.
And for my sister and her princely sons, Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, Which, as thou know’st, unjustly must be spilt.
Who brought it?
The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron, And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another’s way.
I love thee not.
There is not chastity enough in language, Without offense, to utter them.—Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother’s soul being in heaven.
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
I should know that voice.
The king hath granted every article, His daughter first, and, in sequel, all, According to their firm proposed natures.
Tis well.
I’d have thee live, For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.
Wherefore are these things hid?
Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords.
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honor!
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Ill luck, ill luck?
Know we this face or no?
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
I hear some noise within.
Now all the youth of England are on fire, And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.
I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood—    O heavens themselves!
Wherefore to Dover?
Oh, a thousand thousand times—and then of so gentle a condition!
My present business calls me from you now.
Look where he comes.
A damnèd death!
This only is the witchcraft I have used.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
This done, he took the bride about the neck And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo.
But I’ll not chide thee.
That’s not an office for a friend, my lord.
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
Well, well, put up your sword.
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought.
Oh, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
These be the Christian husbands.
True.
No, my dearest love, I would not for the world.
Why art thou angry?
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.
He were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
Welcome, my lord.
If it will not, what remedy?
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit.
Nothing can be made out of nothing.
Ay, my commander.
You do advance your cunning more and more.
He hath honored me of late, and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon.
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
How now, what news?
You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man.
We have done our course.
And not a jot of “Tranio” in your mouth.
Therefore my son i' th' ooze is bedded, and I’ll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded.
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing.
What treasure, uncle?
What, my good lord?
I am for it, lieutenant, and I’ll do you justice.
Come hither, sirrah.
My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.
Macbeth!
But if all aim but this be leveled false, The supposition of the lady’s death Will quench the wonder of her infamy.
What is amiss?
You heard her say herself it was not I.
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease!
The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself.
He did, from first to last.
I have locked the letter in my closet.
They are wise and honorable, And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
Fool, I say!
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
Marry, that can Hero!
You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine— And all for use of that which is mine own.
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
Go hence with diligence.
Cassius, be constant.
Men must not walk too late.
God save the foundation!
Good day to both of you.
Hence, away!
And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?
Why, how now, Hecate!
No, madam, no.
Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
Tis well thou art not fish.
Sit thee down, Clitus.
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and Sent forth great largess to your offices.
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
Oh, by whom?
This is a devil, and no monster.
Ah, welladay!
Then bring me to their sights.
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
What committed?
Either withdraw unto some private place, And reason coldly of your grievances, Or else depart.
By my troth, ’s not so good, and I warrant your cousin will say so.
I will forget my nature.
How now, old lad?
If thou canst love me for this, take me.
Who’s within?
And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad, then camest in smiling, And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter.
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
Abhorrèd slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill!
God be with you.
I have heard her swear ’t.
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls.
Dear lad, believe it.
Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.
I will help you to ’t.
O, ’tis a parlous boy, Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.
Nothing.
Would I were satisfied!
His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster.
Twere good you do so much for charity.
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me.
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper.
Let copulation thrive, for Gloucester’s bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters got ’tween the lawful sheets.
I do, and surely It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st Out of thy sleep.
I do beseech you, take it not amiss; I cannot, nor I will not, yield to you.
Here’s his dry hand up and down.
From me he got it.
Once more, adieu.
It makes us, or it mars us.
Talk no more.
Madam, you must come to your uncle.
Oh, God 'i' good e'en.
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard’s side.
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.   Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
Poor man!
I pray thee, peace.
If any be Trinculo’s legs, these are they. 
Orsino.
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
The strangers all are gone.
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.
Beshrew my very heart, I think you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first.
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
Space enough Have I in such a prison.          
Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
Why?
Wisely and slow.
Well, fare you well, my lord.
Then he shall have no odds.
And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont.
Bind him, I say.
Here love, thou seest how diligent I am, To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee.
All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone To seek you at your house.
You have killed a sweet lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you.
Things must be as they may.
It is so.
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a continuer.
Fie, Demetrius!
And a good soldier too, lady.
I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.
But what see I?
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
Good morrow, Kate—for that’s your name, I hear.
Farewell.
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid.
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind, Nor well, unless in mind.
To the death, my lord.
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child?
He only lived but till he was a man, The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died.
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
If thou dost love me Show me thy thought.
Thou art the thing itself.
What is her mother?
Lord, how it looks about!
Remember First to possess his books, for without them He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command.
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in.
Let me see her.
When beggars die there are no comets seen.
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
I’ll have some proof.
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder.
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
Why then, God forgive me.
His words were, “Farewell, mistress.” Nothing else.
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.
I’ll after him, and see the event of this.
Minion, thou liest.
I will hide me in the arbor.
Ready.
I was not angry since I came to France Until this instant.
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Did he confess it?
My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?
Thou hast amazed me.
And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, Transformèd with their fear, who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
Maid’s mild behavior and sobriety.
The oats have eaten the horses.
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.
Come, let me have a bigger.
Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.
Ha, ha!
Is love a tender thing?
And let her speak of me before her father.
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.
Though this island seem to be desert—  
Behold, I have a weapon.
She will not.
I will not swear these are my hands.
I have heard Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course.
I never saw a woman, But only Sycorax my dam and she.
For the table, sir, it shall be served in.
Why, what would you?
He has brave utensils—for so he calls them— Which when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him.
Softly, my masters.
He did bespeak a chain for me but had it not.
Follow me.
Oh, wonder!
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye, And where care lodges, sleep will never lie.
Yet you began rudely.
Let him look to his bond.
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.
Stand back.
Do not desire to see this letter.
Live thou, I live.
Romeo, away, be gone!
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, Which after-hours give leisure to repent.
Oh, who hath done this deed?
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
To thee a woman’s services are due.
Where is thy instrument?
To this, add defiance, and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounced.” So far my king and master; so much my office.
Boy!
And ever will—though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement—love him dearly, Comfort forswear me!
My father is not dead, for all your saying.
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.
Where lies your text?
Death is my son-in-law.
Let us deal justly.
It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read.
Our expectation hath this day an end.
Ay, marry, must you.
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
Dost thou hear, Iago?
First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what’s their offense; sixth and lastly, why they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge.
I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady.
You’ll “never trust his word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.
Breathe Merriman, the poor cur is embossed, And couple Clowder with the deep-mouthed brach.
For Falstaff, he is dead, and we must earn therefore.
Have you delivered to her our decree?
Thou dar’st as well be hanged.
Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there?
It is not well done, mark you now, to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished.
Caliban!
If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me.
I am glad to see your highness.
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
Or, failing so, yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure.
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur le Bon?
They told me I was everything.
Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.
I cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you—      Pray you, content.
Let me speak a little.
News from Verona!—How now, Balthasar?
He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle.
You say you are a better soldier.
I’ll go another way to work with him.
Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
O hell, what have we here?
What, the chain?
I will survey th' inscriptions back again.
My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you.
Sure we thank you.
Tomorrow will I send.
More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts.
Welcome, gentlemen!
I have a good eye, uncle.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking?
Oh, I have suffered With those that I saw suffer.
He’s now in Florence.
He needs not.
We’ll overreach the graybeard, Gremio, The narrow-prying father, Minola, The quaint musician, amorous Litio, All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.
You’re much deceived.
Draw, you rascal!
And that which spites me more than all these wants, He does it under name of perfect love, As who should say, if I should sleep or eat, 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
Unkindness may do much, And his unkindness may defeat my life, But never taint my love.
I knew it would be your answer.
Here is the cap your Worship did bespeak.
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
I love your majesty According to my bond, no more nor less.
Away!
Gloucester’s eyes?
He will, an if he live to be a man.
Oh, villainous!
To who, my lord?—Who hath the office?
Nothing, Messala.
No, not a whit.
As I!
What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?
The one I’ll stay, the other stayeth me.
Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.
Ay, what else?
He is a gentleman of a good house, and for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns.
So says the Prince and my new-trothèd lord.
This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey.
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall aught?
The king hath strictly charged the contrary.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Good morrow, sweet Hero.
Where am I?
Hear me, recreant!
Oh, my daughter!
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.  
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning.
Say, how is that?
Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Are you our daughter?
Go you down that way towards the Capitol.
My mistress showed me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
But, for mine own part, it was Greek to me.
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, And kill me too.
I shall offend, either to detain or give it.
Does’t not go well?
I am maimed for ever.
Yes, marry, sir.
I will, my Hermia.
Then you do not love me?
Now does my project gather to a head.
Oh, it is my love.
Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes.
Nay then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
The thrice three Muses mourning for the death  Of learning, late deceased in beggary.” That is some satire, keen and critical, Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.
So perhaps did yours.
One side will mock another—th' other too.
That will never be.
It looks a little paler.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
My husband!
Go, hang yourselves all!
What must be shall be.
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Well, gentlemen, I am thus resolved: On Sunday next, you know My daughter Katherina is to be married.
Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence.— Nor you, Lorenzo.—Jessica, nor you.
A good lenten answer.
Who’s that?
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.
You have astonished him.
I have great comfort from this fellow.
You shall have none ill, sir, for I’ll try if they can lick their fingers.
Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown Where should be branded, if that right were right, The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
Therefore I will depart unkissed.
Beware the thane of Fife.
Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me, And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be.
Let me see your eyes.
Let good Antonio look he keep his day, Or he shall pay for this.
Very well,” “go to”!
Advise your fellows so.
You forget yourself To hedge me in.
O you sir, you, come you hither, sir.
Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge.
Oh, no, good Kate.
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope, Have lost their quality, and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
Go tell him of this.
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him.
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on!
I deny it not.
On what occasion God He knows, not I, The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary.
A lover is more condoling.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.
He hath, my lord.
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love, And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next— But, soft!
It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw, cold morning.
But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on ’t.
Come, I will have thee, but, by this light, I take thee for pity.
Here, noble lord.
Despair, and die!
To you I am bound for life and education.
Though now this grainèd face of mine be hid In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow, And all the conduits of my blood froze up, Yet hath my night of life some memory, My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, My dull deaf ears a little use to hear.
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
A blessèd labor, my most sovereign lord.
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s myself, It shall be moon, or star, or what I list, Or e'er I journey to your father’s house.
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
Ay, a tailor, sir.
Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne'er look you i' th' face again.
Know’st thou the way to Dover?
Nay, but Beatrice— Sweet Hero, she is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth.
Find out moonshine, find out moonshine!
I did not give the lie.
To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery.
Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree Unfix his earthbound root?
That did I never hear.
Let’s stay and hear the will.
Amen.
I know you by the waggling of your head.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man.
That’s my good son.
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
What you have said I will consider, what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
If that this simple syllogism will serve, so.
Sir, most heedfully.
Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
A very pleasing night to honest men.
Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire.
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
I pray you, choose another subject.
If a man’s brains were in ’s heels, were ’t not in danger of kibes?
And I must be from thence!
Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord— He’d sow ’t with nettle seed.
No, pray thee.
The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.
Of what personage and years is he?
There thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books; or with a log Batter his skull; or paunch him with a stake; Or cut his weasand with thy knife.
The foul fiend bites my back.
Repays he my deep service With such deep contempt?
Never was seen so black a day as this.
For what offence?
The earth sings when he touches it.
Never till this day Saw I him touched with anger so distempered.
Jailer, look to him.
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one.
No news of them?
I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long a-talking of, the lady is disloyal.
Whence are you, sir?
Why, how now, Dromio.
You tallow face!
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
So do the kings of France unto this day, Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors.
When I know the gentleman, I’ll tell him what you say.
That’s a fault that water will mend.
I pray you, know me when we meet again.
Go, one of you, find out the forester.
Do you hear, Cassio?
Let your highness Command upon me, to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit.
Dear love, adieu.— Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague, be true.
Hark, hark!
Farewell.
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
I will go along.
Oh, that estates, degrees and offices Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honor Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
Madam, good night.
As manhood shall compound.
She give it Cassio?
Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.
My sister may receive it much more worse To have her gentleman abused, assaulted For following her affairs.—Put in his legs.
I’ll tell you, there is good men porn at Monmouth.
Lo, here’s the chain.
Was that mine?
An he speak any thing against me, I’ll take him down, an he were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks.
And what have I to give you back whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
The king doth love you well.
O woe!
Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to.
But as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here.
How shall that faith return again to earth, Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth?
I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.
Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree.
O, come in, equivocator.
I did hear him groan, Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books— “Alas,” it cried, “give me some drink, Titinius,” As a sick girl.
Oh, farewell!
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law.
And now to our French causes.
My gracious sovereign.
For us, we will resign During the life of this old majesty To him our absolute power.
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
Get thee gone, And hire those horses.
Alone, it was the subject of my theme; In company I often glancèd it.
Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand That you yet know not of.
We know what belongs to a watch.
You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions.
Wilt thou have me?
Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight.
Our good old friend, Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow Your needful counsel to our business, Which craves the instant use.
If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.— Your name, honest gentleman?
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
I never hurt you.
Come, thou tortoise!
My duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters' hard commands.
I am not for this ambling.
Mistress, upon my life I tell you true.
Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none? 
Thriftless ambition, that will raven up Thine own lives' means!
Your royal father’s murdered.
Let me have open means to come to them, And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them.
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries.
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.
Here is his Majesty.
Then there’s life in ’t.
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
You have too much respect upon the world.
Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God, And art you yet to your own souls so blind That thou will war with God by murd'ring me?
You shall hear more.
You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands.
Give me thy arm.
And for his cowardship, ask Fabian.
A strange fish!
No more, I pray you.
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
What committed?
But yet I’ll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl, Look to my house.
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion.
Twas I indeed thou promised’st to strike, And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
We cannot be here and there too.
Justice, find the girl!
For shame, you generals!
How can this be?  
Yours by this hand.
Well, you have made a simple choice.
Well, think of marriage now.
Why, then ’tis time to arm and give direction.
Poor Turlygod!” “Poor Tom!”— That’s something yet.
When I told you My state was nothing, I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing, for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend, Engaged my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means.
Sister, you know he promised me a chain.
Are our eyes our own?
So.   
No shame but mine.
He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
With him?
We will persuade him, be it possible, To put on better ere he go to church.
Oh, do-de, do-de, do-de.
The honorable lady of the house, which is she?
Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps.
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
I would have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour.
I’ll give ’t him.
O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue.
My lady would not lose him for more than I’ll say.
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
O plague right well prevented!
A merry whoreson, ha!
Why, all our ranks are broke.
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The armed rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble.
So white, and such a traitor?
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
Stay, fellow.
I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
Let’s see.
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Did he never make you laugh?
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face.
Tell me your mind.
I saw him not.
Let me see, let me see.
I pray you, fail me not.
What’s the matter?
Oh, then belike you fancy riches more.
That a woman conceived me, I thank her.
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.
Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it.
She is spherical, like a globe.
I have it here about me.
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
Good morrow, cousin.
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.
And to sink in it, should you burthen love— Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord, her governor, her king.
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
Why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch?
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
Nothing but “low” and “little”!— Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole Till that the duke give order for his burial.
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
Master, knock the door hard.
Thou hast.
Where the devil should he learn our language?
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness.
Yea, my good lord.
Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!
From that place I shall no leading need.
How now, cousin Hero!
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
Away!
Hang not on my garments.
Ay, and wisely.
Ride you this afternoon?
Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage And frustrate his proud will.
I am none of these, my lord.
Fortune is an excellent moral.
I’ll tear her all to pieces!
The count himself here hard by woos her.
Call her forth, brother.
Richard except, those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow.
I have too grieved a heart To take a tedious leave.
I was a fine fool to take it.
Here comes your father.
My lord?
Eyes, look your last.
And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today.
Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership.
Ratcliffe, my lord, ’tis I.
Ay, more.
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
In which regard,
Mistress!
Ay, he.
What, in the midst of the street?
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
I am content.
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor.
My husband?
Four nights will quickly dream away the time.
Gentlemen, rise.
My lord and brother, God save you.
Next month with us.
And that’s but unwholesome food, they say.
Then, to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly—wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
Well struck!
Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair Where Brutus may but find it.
How sound is she asleep!
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns, and tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper. 
No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son, for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.
Set me where you stand.
By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me.
Out upon her!
Speak.
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present.
He smiled and said “The better for our purpose.” He was in the right, and so indeed it is.
Keep your cabins.
Be not afeard.
Vent my folly?
Good morrow, Father.
Thou call’st on him that hates thee.
What would you?
Tis very good.
Well.— Now come, my Ariel!
Would?
What are they, beseech your ladyship?
Good.
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool, To put the finger in the eye and weep Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
Touching our person, seek we no revenge, But we our kingdom’s safety must so tender, Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws We do deliver you.
Where is thy husband now?
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
A gentle scroll.
Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time.
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right, Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities.
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church, Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
Is ’t possible?
Why, I think so.
Farewell.
What’s here?
Madman, thou errest.
Yea, marry, let them come before me.
My lord.
The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks.
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
She that would be your wife now ran from you.
The bloody proclamation to escape, That followed me so near—O our lives' sweetness,
Why then, let fall Your horrible pleasure.
Before and apace.
Come on, gentle my lord, Sleek o'er your rugged looks.
Why art thou here, Come from the farthest step of India?
I’ll not fight with thee.
Hence will I to my ghostly friar’s close cell, His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
Here comes the Prince and Claudio.
Save you, worthy general!
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool?
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
Your mistress bears well.
Peace, you rogue, no more o' that.
Sir, my liege, Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business.
I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else.
O mercy, God!
I’ll know his humor when he knows his time.
That goldsmith there, were he not packed with her, Could witness it, for he was with me then, Who parted with me to go fetch a chain, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, Where Balthasar and I did dine together.
Canst thou, when thou command’st the beggar’s knee, Command the health of it?
When are you married, madam?
Adieu.
Signor Antonio, many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances.
Then let them use us well, else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
And if your love Can labor ought in sad invention, Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb And sing it to her bones.
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
I must leave them and seek some better service.
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago.
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.— Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not.
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop.
If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
Therefore, farewell.
Ay, madam.
Apollo plays, And twenty cagèd nightingales do sing: Or wilt thou sleep?
If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also, look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb, in your own conscience, now?
So quick bright things come to confusion.
She’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
Good my lord, enter.
I’ll able 'em.
I stay too long from her.
Nay, good, be patient.
Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay, For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.
O Pyramus, arise!
Call my train together.— Degenerate bastard, I’ll not trouble thee.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, And I’ll appear again.
What kind of god art thou, that suffer’st more Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
But, till the king come forth, and not till then, Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.
Farewell, my lords.
Claudio!
This is as uncivil as strange.
When I do name him, let it be thy part To praise him more than ever man did merit.
And I do believe your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy’s day. 
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front; And now, instead of mounting barbèd steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a thought browner; and your gown’s a most rare fashion, i' faith.
If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back, Lay not your blame on me.
See where he looks out of the window.
Let 'em enter.
No, sir, no jot.
Why, thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad. 
Delay not, Caesar.
Wherefore weep I then?
But how did you desire it should be made?
Speak, man.
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust!
Ill will never said well.
So tell them, Publius.
Mine’s not an idle cause.
How fine my master is!
Nay, as they dare.
Sweet, so would I.
I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes.
If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
What says my lord?
Even for the blood That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
Aroint thee, witch!” the rump-fed runnion cries.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
For often, with a solemn earnestness— More than indeed belonged to such a trifle— He begged of me to steal it.
Ay, boy, ready.
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound?
Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.
Comes not that blood as modest evidence To witness simple virtue?
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.
Silence!
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
Only I yield to die.
I’ll have the work ta'en out And give ’t Iago.
There’s husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out.
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews With agèd cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard or cat o' mountain.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.
It is impossible they bear it out.
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
True, madam.
She is a royal princess.
You talk!
Was ever woman in this humor wooed?
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot To mark the full-fraught man and best endued With some suspicion.
Sing it tonight.
Nay, that’s not your way.
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
Which of them shall I take?
Marry, your manhood, mew!
But shall ’t be shortly?
What, jealous Oberon?—Fairies, skip hence.
All will be well.
Oh, by no means.
If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.
If not, adieu.
Do you not hear me speak?
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?
Keep thou the left.
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading, Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate, whose right Suits not in native colors with the truth; For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation
Repose you there, while I to this hard house— More harder than the stones whereof ’tis raised, Which even but now, demanding after you, Denied me to come in—return, and force Their scanted courtesy.
There’s knocking at the gate.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
Now, by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
And badest me bury love.
We will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.
Stand aside.
Now, banished Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned, So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest, Shall find thee full of labors.
All this my sister is, or else should be.
We will greet the time.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding, And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you.
It was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine and let thee out.
The sorrow that I have by right is yours, And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius, He should not humor me.
But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar.
What are they that do play it?
So the fool follows after.
No, not for Venice.
There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
I could be sad.
He is my prisoner.
I beseech you, sir, go.
Which of you—if you were a prince’s son Being pent from liberty, as I am now— If two such murderers as yourselves came to you, Would not entreat for life?
Bless you, fair dame!
Wherefore do you come?
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
Even he.
What, i' th' storm, i' th' night?
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
Away with it!
He is as full of valor as of kindness, Princely in both.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend, And he repents not that he pays your debt.
Filth, thou liest!
Who is so gross That cannot see this palpable device?
Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste— Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
No, you unnatural hags,
But yet I run before my horse to market.
Good my lord, enter here.
Ay, to me.
And thy father Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued.
When it is paid according to the tenor.
Art not thou the Lady Olivia’s fool?
The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back.
Come, lords, will you go To comfort Edward with our company?
And so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end and she must be blind too.
Take you some company, and away to horse.
Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show?
Strike his wife?
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
List a brief tale, And when ’tis told, oh, that my heart would burst!
It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste.
Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry.
Am I like such a fellow?
But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury, and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his.
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live— That were impossible—but, I pray you both, Possess the people in Messina here How innocent she died.
You shall not gauge me By what we do tonight.
It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort, quite from the answer of his degree.
Why, shall we turn to men?
God give him joy!
Well, I cannot tell. 
What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter?
Mend” me, thou saucy fellow? 
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you?
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances.
Leave me, I say.
Why then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio Have been deceived.
And in assemblies too.
Even so.—Cover their faces.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust, Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, Even where his raging eye or savage heart, Without control, lusted to make his prey.
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
O perdurable shame!
Come, bustle, bustle.
This kindness will I show.
Very well mended.
A drum, a drum!
Have I not reason, beldams as you are?
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
And, Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor.
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land.
Help!
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
I had it of him.
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato’s door, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight.
Monday, my lord.
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
So I do, madonna.
Make it a word and a blow.
Give me your hand.
My wits faints.
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse inv Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her!
One Hero died defiled, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid.
Here’s goodly gear.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death.
Yea, my lord.
But this place is too cold for hell.
See what a rent the envious Casca made.
Hum!
The things that threatened me Ne'er looked but on my back.
Your name, I pray you, friend?
Oh, let us yet be merciful.
That a monster should be such a natural!
What might import my sister’s letter to him?
Think on thy sins.
Upon condition Publius shall not live, Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony.
I thank you.
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.
How, my pretty York?
I stay here on my bond.
Ratcliffe!
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me.
What do I fear?
Where’s my son Edmund?
Thou teachest me.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh.
Chastisement!
Call you?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
Who intercepts my expedition?
There’s fire ready.
Well, I will do it, though I take thee in the king’s company.
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!
Unless I have mista'en his colors much, Which well I am assured I have not done, His regiment lies half a mile, at least, South from the mighty power of the king.
Oh, here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
For my part, the sea cannot drown me.
What’s the matter?
And yon tall anchoring bark,
Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wished for.
Or neither?
Prithee, listen well.
Patience, good sir.
Indeed?
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.
The next, our ship— Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split— Is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when We first put out to sea.
A carrion death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll.
Infirm of purpose!
Foul shame upon you, you have all moved mine.
Unless the master were the man.
Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew’st Tybalt—there art thou happy.
I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long.
Wilt thou, Strato?
Mistress!
Right joyous are we to behold your face, Most worthy brother England.
O Pomfret, Pomfret!
O, that once more you knew but what you are!
God hold it, to your Honor’s good content!
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong!
Tis no time to play now.
Tedious” and “brief”?
When in that moment so it came to pass, Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
Has he never before sounded you in this business?
I will go call the watch.
He that conceals him, death.
My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly.
There is something else.
I would I knew thy heart.
I’ll die for ’t but some woman had the ring.
I cannot tell; I think not.
Will you not tell me who told you so?
But note me, signor—
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
Hark, boy!
Now, Balthazar, As I have ever found thee honest true, So let me find thee still.
Oh, thou art deceived.
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage.
He’s worth more sorrow, And that I’ll spend for him.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
Yet keep the French the field.
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'Tis hard to reconcile.
Cousins, you know what you have to do.—O, I cry you mercy, friend.
To cabin, silence!
Yet there he was, and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out.
Lord, how art thou changed!
Kill!
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
I think I did, sir.
But adieu.
And yesternight, at supper, You suddenly arose and walked about, Musing and sighing, with your arms across, And when I asked you what the matter was, You stared upon me with ungentle looks.
Why, let her except, before excepted.
Before my body I throw my warlike shield.
Had he a hand to write this, a heart and brain to breed it in?
But he, poor man, by your first order died, And that a wingèd Mercury did bear.
Give us the place alone.
I know not.
Oh, curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites!
Inform her full of my particular fear, And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more.
Then would to Heaven that I had never seen ’t!
Please it your grace, on to the state affairs.
Hark!
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought The wood began to move.
What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
Tis a fair young man, and well attended.
Welcome, Signior.
Speak not of Helena.
Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again.
My lord, I’ll tell you that self bill is urged Which in th' eleventh year of the last king’s reign Was like, and had indeed against us passed But that the scambling and unquiet time Did push it out of farther question.
And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities.
Hence!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears.
Yearly will I do this rite.
By 'r lady, I think it be so.
Down with the Montagues!
No, no.
Take you assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum.
Bring me no more reports.
You stand.
Fut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.
Ay.
Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life.
You minion, you, are these your customers?
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid, Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen’s torch be lighted—but in vain.
Is ’t not Hortensio?
What comfortable hour canst thou name, That ever graced me in thy company?
Do not torment me.
News, friends!
Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.
And now methinks I have a mind to it.
Tis hard; almost impossible.
We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th' enragèd soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore.
I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Pray you come in.
We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, “Here may you see the tyrant.”      I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet, And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
I have sent after him.
Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested, which, in weight to reanswer, his pettiness would bow under.
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow  Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
I will make your peace with him if I can. 
Oh, so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, And that which you did swear to keep for me, I will become as liberal as you.
Speak again.
No, believe me.
I told him what I thought, and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true.
By th' clock ’tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
Why, madam, if I were your father’s dog, You should not use me so.
O Juliet, I already know thy grief.
Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound, A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire.
Go, make money.
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
You wrong me every way.
I like you lads.
Come, go in.
Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I’ll bide your proof.
Away!
You whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Upon this hint I spake.
Oh, if it prove, Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love!
Did you know him?
Let us take the law of our sides.
Some dungeon.
My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another.
Come, bid me do anything for thee.
Up.
Neither, my lord.
Cool it with a baboon’s blood, Then the charm is firm and good.
They are all welcome.
So could I too.
My fan, Peter.
But let it rest.—Now, Litio, to you.
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
Out upon it, old carrion!
The sight whereof I think you had from me, From Claudio and the Prince.
What, must our mouths be cold?
Can you deny all this?
Let some of my people have a special care of him.
That nothing do but meditate on blood, To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire, And everything that seems unnatural.
O thou dull Moor!
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty.
How now, Malvolio!
The man i' th' moon!
Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
You have spoken truer than you purposed.
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!

Go to, away.
A fire, good Curtis.
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board.

Wot you what, my lord?
How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good?
Tranio, let’s go.

Tis not the first time you were overshot.
Good morrow to you.

Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein?
Sir, have pity, I’ll be his surety.

Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness. 
God and our innocence defend and guard us!
I am content.
And I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
Who’s there, in th' other devil’s name?
Why dost thou use me thus?
I bleed, sir, but not killed.
If you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.—Cheerly, good hearts!—Out of our way, I say.
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
Well, I conceive.
Sir, in Argier.
that claims marriage of me, i could find in my heart to stay here still, and turn witch.
What profane wretch art thou?
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
Mercutio, thou consort’st with Romeo.
I pray thee, cease thy counsel, Which falls into mine ears as profitless As water in a sieve.
Is it so, countrymen?
Down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above.
My lord of Burgundy.
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.
His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication.
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed.
Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.
No, no, no, no!
A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
Was he not born of woman?
God keep me so.—Our heralds go with him.
Let me work.
Have you not hurt your head?
It is a wise father that knows his own child.
Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound.
Till he come home again, I would forbear.
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go I toward Aragon.
A thing for me?
Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?
None.
Now ’mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle.
O me!
Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
He longs to see your head.
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access.
What’s this?
Me, a groat?
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd.
Stay, Tybalt, stay!
The early village cock Hath twice done salutation to the morn.
Tom’s a-cold.
Oh my fair warrior!
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report.
Thou old unhappy traitor, Briefly thyself remember.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
Mend when thou canst.
Lives, sir.
Thou sing’st sweet music.
Ay me!
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
Couple it with something.
Did you see him?
When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man?
He said the truth.
The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands; A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well, One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell.
What’s she?
There lies your way.
Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.
If I stand here, I saw him.
Write down Prince John a villain.
Amen.
I am sorry for thee, friend.
I shall never see my gold again.
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth.
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
Marry, I fare well, For here is cheer enough.
I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.
Tis said they eat each other.
Sit, worthy friends.
Nay, that he did not.
Put on your nightgown.
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?

O hard condition, Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel But his own wringing.
Thou art on thy deathbed.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out, To let him live.
The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.
I do not think there is any such woman.
At mine own house, good lady.
It is twice blessed: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
Nay, I dare not swear it.
Therefore forbear awhile.
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
Yea, even I alone.
Presently away, For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.— Come, lady, die to live.
I am sure of that.
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him.
My most dear Gloucester!
Who meets us here?
Kent, on thy life, no more.
Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
You are a royal one, and we obey you.
Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.
The mighty gods defend thee!
I pray the gods she may, with all my heart!
There’s something in ’t That is deceivable.
I cannot go to, man, nor ’tis not very well.
What, in our house?
By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster.
Why are you drawn?
Ay, his breast.
Who is it that complains unto the king That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy!
Pray, give me that.
You may think I love you not.
So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech.
Nobody come?
Should not upbraid our course.
I never saw my father in my life.
When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek.
That light we see is burning in my hall.

Bellario greets your grace.    
Whose tongue?
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
I told him you were asleep.
Conclude, conclude, he is in love.
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.— O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop To help me after?
Ay.
Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.
I’ll set her on.
A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his.
Come, Nerissa.—
But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old.
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other.
It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me.
To me, sir?
That they were, I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies.—When did you lose your daughter?
you know me well.
He prays you to save his life.
Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind, That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.
If God will be avengèd for this deed, O, know you yet He doth it publicly!

But did you not request to have it cut?

I was born free as Caesar.
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Ah, where’s my man?—Give me some aqua vitae.— These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
He’ll be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him.
Cobweb.
O happy dagger, This is thy sheath.
But if she cannot love you, sir?
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
Say thou but “ay,” And that bare vowel  Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
Ay, with Cassio.
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand.
I shall be saved by my husband.
And thou must make a dullard of the world, If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spirits To make thee seek it.”    O strange and fastened villain!
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.—   O murderous coxcomb!
Let him kill one first.
Zounds, he dies!
O bloody Richard!
We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks, Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee.

We will proceed no further in this business.
What, in my sight?—Bianca, get thee in.

Seek, seek for him, Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it.
No, not he, though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare.
Will you withdraw?
And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.
When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads, ’tis much to draw them thence, So sweet is zealous contemplation.
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath, A charitable duty of my order.

I am ashamed that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace; Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
Return to her, and fifty men dismissed?
I have not ’scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs.
The king’s a-bed.
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
Well then, the peace which you before so urged Lies in his answer.

Yea, and the best person too.
Companion, hence!

First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point.
But speak, Egeus.
Fear me not.
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her, Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, That true hearts cannot bear it.
If I owe you anything, I will pay you in cudgels.
She cannot deny it.
I hear the news, my lord.
Sir, I say to you it is thought you are false knaves.

Tom, away!
You look wearily.
If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him.
What is your name?
Certainly, sir, I can.

I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter.
Lucentio, gentle sir.
Come, march to wakes and fairs and market towns.
With the earl, sir, here within.
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
Why, there’s no remedy.
Thou told’st me Thou didst hold him in thy hate.
Why, Fool?
And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?
Hold you still.

Let me see.
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.
Thou shalt, I warrant thee.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her, And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.
You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?
Monster, I will kill this man.
God, God forgive us all!
Farewell!
Spout, rain!
Who’s there?
I’ll grow a talker for this gear.
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall To cureless ruin.
Tush, Gremio.
Goneril with a white beard?
Therefore prepare to die.
Cry but “Ay me!” Pronounce but “love” and “dove.” Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, One nickname for her purblind son and heir, Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid.— He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.
I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you.

A spirit?
I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney.
Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck.
I am sure you both of you remember me.
I am informèd thoroughly of the cause.
I must talk a word with you.
Brutus and Caesar—what should be in that “Caesar”?
Excellent!
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
Tyrant, show thy face!
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son,
I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.

So should we you, if you should be our king.
Then have at thee, boy!

O noble judge!
What is a traitor?
Why should she write to Edmund?
Nay, I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.
Wherefore this ghastly looking?
It doth appear you are a worthy judge.
I grant you.
You see how full of changes his age is.
Ay, do you fear it?
If I had, my weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you.
Caesar speaks.
I mean, the Lord Protector.
If it be that— If it be that, or any that was hers, It speaks against her with the other proofs.
Be quiet, people.
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to.
Mistress, that you know.
What is ’t you do?
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk.
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.
But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?
I am gone, though I am here.
It is a paltry cap, A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.
Here, Peter Quince.
Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meet’st the fellow.
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em.
Would I were so too.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest— For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men— Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
The Lord Grandpré.
Come, shall I make you two friends?
He did in some sort, indeed, handle women, but then he was rheumatic, and talked of the Whore of Babylon.
Ay, marry, what is he?
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
No, sir.
Give me now leave to leave thee.
Do you amend it then.
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, Because they have been still my adversaries.
No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself.
Our wars are done, the Turks are drowned.
I may sit in a corner and cry, “Heigh-ho for a husband!” Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word.
There is a litter ready.
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
A very even way, but no such friend.
First, know my horse is tired, my master and mistress fallen out.
But while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
Welcome to Cyprus.
I have broke with her father and his goodwill obtained.
And I do with an eye of love requite her.
The ground is bloody.—Search about the churchyard.
Tis bootless to exclaim.
Why, sir, he comes not.
Scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were.
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
On what compulsion must I?
I tell you what you shall do.
You mar our labor.
Were I a common laugher, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester, if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And, after, scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
And after that he came thus sad away?
Will it not be?
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
Why, whose is it?
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, Seek through your camp to find you.
Nay, you must forget that.
And be not easily won to our requests.
I did not see you since you sent me hence, Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
When will he be here?
Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
This purse of ducats I received from you, And Dromio my man did bring them me.
Knock, knock!
If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no.
There must be conclusions.
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away.
Tis even so, For let our finger ache and it endues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain.
Drown cats and blind puppies!
Take away the fool, gentlemen.
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law, Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
How goes it now?
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention —Brutus, what shall be done?
He bounds from the earth, as if his entrails were hairs, le cheval volant, the Pegasus, qui a les narines de feu.
So shall I, love, And so, I pray, be you.
Confess yourself freely to her, importune her help to put you in your place again.
If you would know your wronger, look on me.
I will none.
An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again.
Oh, strange!
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is returned.
How now, Roderigo!
Nor I neither.
Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts.
Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
His life was gentle, and the elements So mixed in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world, “This was a man.” According to his virtue let us use him, With all respect and rites of burial.
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife!
What do you see?
Oh, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authorized by her grandam.
My brave spirit!
I have no more sons of the royal blood For thee to slaughter.
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
Stephano!
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
Too old by heaven.
What is it thou didst say?
So were you.
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
And did not she herself revile me there?
Who talks within there?
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino’s.
Still in this fashion, color, ornament, For him I imitate.
Thou hast taken against me a most just exception, but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.
Romeo, will you come to your father’s?
I do remember now.
Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.—Farewell, dear sister.
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.

He came to me, and I delivered it.
By Janus, I think no.
Let’s take leave of him.
How hast thou offended?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither?
No more.
I muse why she’s at liberty.
How?
Ha!
Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
Wilt thou destroy him then? 
I fear my Thisbe’s promise is forgot!— And thou, O Wall, O sweet, O lovely Wall, That stand’st between her father’s ground and mine.
Oh, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo.
Yond island carrions, desperate of their bones, Ill-favoredly become the morning field.
Well, tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, That you today promised to tell me of?
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires.
I’ll not believe ’t.
O weary night, O long and tedious night, Abate thy hours.
Again!
I do.
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me.
An interlude!
Be not offended.
Nor for yours neither.

But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
After her, after her.
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh 
Romeo, come forth.
Would all were well—but that will never be.
I might do ’t as well i' th' dark.
And for my love I pray you wrong me not.

God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
O noble sir!
Tis dangerous to be spoken.
Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there would a scab follow.
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time.

I have heard too much, and your words and performances are no kin together.
Ay, but their sense is shut.
Tis fittest.
Not so happy, yet much happier.
What wouldst thou with us?
How goes the world, sir, now?
Are they married, think you?
Close by, my master.
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
Commend me to thy lady.
Committed?

Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business' making Than we bring men to comfort them.
O love!
All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men, and there’s not a nose among twenty but can smell him that’s stinking.
Nor I know not Where I did lodge last night.
I will follow.

Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile, And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
Who’s there?
Have I caught thee?
Hark, they roar.
Where’s Publius?
Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal.
All may be well; but if God sort it so, 'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
Your man and you are marvelous merry, sir.
Mark well Metellus Cimber.
Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
Oh, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly To seal love’s bonds new made than they are wont To keep obligèd faith unforfeited.

Up to the breach, you dogs!
That you should here repent you, The actors are at hand, and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know.

Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart—     I must prevent thee, Cimber.
I am not well.
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
Let me have surgeons.
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
Let’s meet him and receive him.
Alas, he faints!
Alack, why thus?
On thy love, I charge thee.
I’ll go farther off.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
Nothing, my lord.
Good cheer, Antonio!
So the spirit is eased.
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca, That so I may, by this device at least, Have leave and leisure to make love to her And, unsuspected, court her by herself.
What concern they?
The king?
Remain thou still in darkness.
Know I these men that come along with you?
Teach it but how, And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
Yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love.
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool, As under privilege of age to brag What I have done being young, or what would do Were I not old.
My men should call me “lord.” I am your goodman.
What are you then determinèd to do?
Sola, sola!
Alack, ’tis he.
And till she come, as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood So justly to your grave ears I’ll present How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love And she in mine.
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.
Relent, sweet Hermia—And, Lysander, yield Thy crazèd title to my certain right.

I pray thee, mark me.
O, my lord, You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
Not for the wide world.
You shall, Mark Antony.
Not know my voice!
Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.
Graces will appear, and there’s an end.
No, uncle, I’ll none.
Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?
My countrymen—     Peace, silence!
Go fetch them hither.

My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
Whence come you?
But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours.
How the moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awaked.
Good my lord, enter.
Come you to make confession to this Father?
Marry, ’tis enough.
That’s my fear.
They would be better if well followed.
Ho, open the door.
Fourscore ducats at a sitting!
It is.
He cannot flatter, he.
You do not mind the play.

Yet you are withered.

Travelers ne'er did lie, Though fools at home condemn 'em.
I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.
Why, Fool?
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Here’s no knavery!
Your virtue is my privilege.
Please you, sir, Do not omit the heavy offer of it.
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile.
Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
But you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature’s best.
Tis death for anyone in Mantua To come to Padua.
Good, i' faith.
How now, sir?
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea monster.
Out of my sight!
The hurt cannot be much.
Art thou indeed?
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel, And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
It is.
This day I breathed first.
Speak.
Do as I bid you.
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people.
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three. 
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
As you from crimes would pardoned be, Let your indulgence set me free.
He’ll fright you up, i' faith.
And one Deformed is one of them.
His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse.
Show.
Your Grace is too costly to wear every day.
It seldom visits sorrow.
Good night.
The cause is in my will.
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” And well said too—for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honorable Without the stamp of merit?
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body.
I am right loath to go.
Well, but to my choice.
I’ll come to thee straight.
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in to make all split.
The king is coming.
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
What’s here?
Give me a torch.
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning.
Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
Yet I love thee too.
Prithee, do not turn me about.
The duke’s to blame in this.
It is my duty, sir.
Let her hang me.
Fathers commonly Do get their children.
Troth, no, no more than reason.
I will run, fiend.
Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.
I wis, your grandam had a worser match.
All’s hushed as midnight yet.
You, you, ay, you!
This is some fellow, Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness and constrains the garb Quite from his nature.
Oh, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
By what?
Tis wonderful.
I’ll apprehend him.
Where is my wife?
How do you, Cassio?—Oh, a chair, a chair!
How say you to that, Malvolio?
My lady will hang thee for thy absence.
And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
You amaze me.
In troth, ’tis morning.
Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.

Have we devils here?
A thousand thousand!
Neighbors and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table, You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Antonio, I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself.
The clock hath stricken three.
Signor Bassanio, hear me.
Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
What is the matter?
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city’s eye, And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here today.
And now I have the boy, I will undo This hateful imperfection of her eyes.
O my good master!
Her name is Katherina Minola, Renowned in Padua for her scolding tongue.
Of thirty sail.
Tis a point of wisdom.
Yea, Signior, and depart when you bid me.
But the rarity of it is—which is indeed almost beyond credit—  As many vouched rarities are.
Oh, he is even in my mistress' case, Just in her case.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
O, my poor brother!
Lead the way.
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
At your request!
Tis strange, strange.
I will weep for thee, For this revolt of thine methinks is like Another fall of man.—Their faults are open.
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth, and I praise God for you.  
Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent.
Do you like me, Kate?
Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way.—Let the watch come forth.
Here is my bed.
Boy!
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Wherefore!
To who?
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me occasion.
Oh, do not wish one more!
You have good judgment in horsemanship.
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
My services to your lordship.
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
What would you with her, sir?
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us.
Service.
When thou wakest, if she be by, Beg of her for remedy.
Fear not, Cesario.
Fare you well. 
When is the royal day?
Tis as arrant a piece of knavery, mark you now, as can be offert, in your conscience now, is it not?
If then they chanced to slack you, We could control them.
Be warned by me, then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs.
One from the Lord Stanley.
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
Did I not tell you she was innocent?
They shall be apprehended by and by.
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart, The object and the pleasure of mine eye, Is only Helena.
My creditors grow cruel.
Worse and worse!
For, of my heart, those charms, thine eyes, are blotted.
No, let me know, And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool To shake the head, relent and sigh, and yield To Christian intercessors.
We’ll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
Tis with cares.
Farewell, dear Father.
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I; I for an Edward weep; so do not they.
A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.
He, he, ’tis he.
I think our father will hence tonight.
Let’s not consort with them.
I cannot tell.
Never—O fault!—revealed myself unto him Until some half-hour past, when I was armed.
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother England.
Know the glove!
But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke.
Give me your arm.
Monday!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself— In each eye, one.
Let’s see these pockets.
A Roman.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Proof enough to misuse the Prince, to vex Claudio, to undo Hero, and kill Leonato.
Surely, a princely testimony, a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant, surely!
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.— Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
His hour is almost past.
I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay.
Pray, set it down and rest you.
Comes there any more of it?
Come on, assay.
I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
Besides, they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all, admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end.
It is a business of some heat.
You do assist the storm.
I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
Tell the hot duke that Lear— No, but not yet.
What’s the wager?
I’ll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.— Helen, I love thee.
Nor no one here, for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
A greater gift?
Alas the day, it did.
Horrible sight!
He had none.
Not yet.”      The hour’s now come.
Farewell, good Launcelot.
How now, what’s the matter?
We shall further think on ’t.
Ah, cut my lace asunder, That my pent heart may have some scope to beat, Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
Come, sir, I am for you.
I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part.
That face of his I do remember well.
How now, Lord Stanley, what’s the news?
And bid her come hither.
Tis well you offer it behind her back.
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
But either it was different in blood—
Thou villain Capulet!
The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear.
Come hither, Catesby.
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, Nurse.
I am not bid for love.
There’s a time for all things.
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess, Upon the like devotion as yourselves, To gratulate the gentle princes there.
Yes, my conscience, He did us great good.
Show his eyes and grieve his heart.
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death?
Hark.
A joint stool.
Holla!
Threescore and ten I can remember well, Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings.
We will have no telling.
I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.
I pray, weep not.
He did receive his letters and is coming.
On him I lay what you would lay on me, The right and fortune of his happy stars, Which God defend that I should wring from him.
Murder!
Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I, at the least.
Bind fast his corky arms.
A challenge, on my life.
The folly of this island.
How comes that?
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known.
Speak, speak.
Oh, falsely, falsely murdered!
I never looked for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
So good night unto you all.
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
Hear you the news abroad?
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
thieves!
Peace yet again.
I pray you, let it stand.
If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck.
Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent— Look back!
Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
I shaked you, sir, and cried.
And come with naked swords.
There remain And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French.
Keep close, I thee command.
Let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest.
Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages.
Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
Let us quit all And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.
Gone she is.
I will not go today, and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is.  
After the battle let George Stanley die.
But tell not me.
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
Oh, farewell!
I fear ’tis choleric.
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.
Heavens keep him from these beasts!
Was not this love indeed?
Be bold, and take thy stand.
She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.
Her lord is come.
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase, and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
Beware the ides of March.
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death, As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.
Whither are they vanished?
Why are you silent?
Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.
I know him; he wears a lock.
Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart—a small spark, all the rest on ’s body cold.
Madam, here comes my lord.
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
Good morrow, Caesar.
He will not know what all but he do know.
Where is my lord?
Now in faith, Gratiano, You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief.
My life upon ’t, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Death of thy soul!
Did my father strike my gentleman For chiding of his fool?
Answer my life my judgment, Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least, Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness.
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
I know not, madam.
Titinius, if thou lovest me, Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again, that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
What news?
We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.
Let their heads be slickly combed, their blue coats brushed, and their garters of an indifferent knit.
I will hence tonight.
Neither.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
Is that any thing now?
Send Thy token of reprieve.
Will you go to them?
All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly.
No, not for all the world.
I’ll not be far from you.
Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse.
Hastings and Edward’s children, Grey and Rivers, Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward, Vaughan, and all that have miscarrièd By underhand, corrupted, foul injustice, If that your moody, discontented souls Do through the clouds behold this present hour, Even for revenge mock my destruction.— This is All Souls' Day, fellow, is it not?
Lovers, to bed.
Poor Tom’s a-cold.
Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter.
Macbeth!
Stood the state so?
Four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster.
Now do I see ’tis true.
Say that she frown; I’ll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew.
I will not trouble thee, my child.
The fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.
I must another way To fetch a ladder, by the which your love Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
O, sir, upon her nose, all o'er-embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadas of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.
I’ll see no more.
But there’s a saying very old and true: “If that you will France win, Then with Scotland first begin.” For once the eagle England being in prey, To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs, Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat.
With all my heart.
He says for Brutus' sake He finds himself beholding to us all.
Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature.
Oh!
O traitors, villains!
This is not the way To win your daughter.
Spoke like an officer!
It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.
Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is?
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs In blood of princes, and the wounded steeds Fret fetlock deep in gore, and with wild rage Yerk out their armèd heels at their dead masters, Killing them twice.
Yea, sir, we hope.
Why dost thou call him “knave”?
Know, my long lord, The marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!
Let me entreat you.
Go to.
You look pale, and gaze, And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
He’s dead and rotten.
All schooldays' friendship, childhood innocence?
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
Here comes your father.
Calphurnia!
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
What, is the fellow mad?
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it.
No, sir.
I’ll see thee hanged on Sunday first.
How is’t with you, sir?
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar, And things unlucky charge my fantasy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew, my master.
No.
Possess them not with fear.
Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en.
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots.
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
And so I am, I am.
By Jupiter, This shall not be revoked.
Behold the threaden sails, Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind, Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea, Breasting the lofty surge.
With an eye of green in ’t.
I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends That purpose merriment.
Who, he?
Antonio is a good man.
How now, fellow?
A contagious breath.
We thank your Honor.
More pity that the eagle should be mewed While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
Commend me to Lord William.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
This is the door.
Sir, no.
Your bedchamber.
If he say so, may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day!
Scape being drunk for want of wine.
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
Prithee, peace.
Ay, a thousand times.—Peter!
That’s more to me than my wetting.
Canst thou bring me to th' party?
What, Curio?
I say he shall go to prison.
I will not have to do with you.
If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness, be happy then, For it is done.
O, then I see you will part but with light gifts.
For himself to mar,” quoth he?
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
So that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many—either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry—why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills.
Claribel.
What should I say, sweet lady?
My leg is cut in two.
What do you mean?
Out, alas!

She cannot be so much without true judgment, Having so swift and excellent a wit As she is prized to have, as to refuse So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband.
No better.
I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall—I will do such things— What they are yet I know not, but they shall be The terrors of the earth.
I do,  This touches me in reputation.
Come on.
She, dying, gave it me And bid me, when my fate would have me wived, To give it her.
And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.
Come, Antonio.
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
Here’s the smell of the blood still.
How idly do they talk!
I would she were in heaven, so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
As strange as the thing I know not.
Die and be damned, and  It is well.
Tis something, nothing: 'Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.
Well, peace be with you.
We’ll leave you, Brutus.
To one of your receiving Enough is shown.
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music.
When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too.
I might have saved her.
The date is out of such prolixity.
Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth.
Tears his white hair, Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage, Catch in their fury and make nothing of.
Come like shadows; so depart!
Sir Topas!
It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us, Who is too good to pity thee.
I did so, and take heed on ’t, Make it a darling like your precious eye.
We would so, and then go a-batfowling.
I have possessed your grace of what I purpose, And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond.
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife.
And that’s true too.
A could never abide carnation.
Oh, the heavens!
In verity you did.—My bones bear witness, That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for— A thing not in his power to bring to pass But swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.
Thou shalt not choose but go.
The princes both make high account of you—  I know they do, and I have well deserved it.
You are welcome, sir.
Then away she started To deal with grief alone.
The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.
It is Brabantio.
To him, Sir Topas.
To horse, you gallant princes, straight to horse.
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life.
Then fly!
If she lives till doomsday, she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world.
Upon mine honor, Myself, my brother, and this grievèd count Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret.
The villain shall not ’scape.
Madam, I am not well.
Twill endure wind and weather.
I am famished in his service.
All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with.
Now heaven walks on earth.
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!
My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours, And never in my days, I do protest, Was it so precious to me as ’tis now.
The old man’s daughter told us all.
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.
Then he’s a rogue, and a passy-measures pavin.
Belike Some things—I know not what.
Ay, when the special thing is well obtained, That is, her love, for that is all in all.
A king, a king!
I bespoke it not.
Husband, let’s follow to see the end of this ado.
Come, good Athenian.
Even she: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Yet I’ll not shed her blood, Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Farewell.
Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too.— Your name, I beseech you, sir?
I know you not.
Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast Misused ere used, by times ill-used o'erpast.
Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire?
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man.
Why, you were with him, were you not?
Tis the infirmity of his age.
A noble prisoner!
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
Nothing but songs of death.
Sir, speed you.
My voice is in my sword.
A turn or two I’ll walk To still my beating mind.
No, sir, the worse.
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give.
Why then, the devil give him good of it!
Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds, Rather than make unprofited return.
I will not fail.
Nor know I aught By me that’s said or done amiss this night, Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice, And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us.
Ay, sir.
Out, loathèd medicine!
Sir Toby Belch!
Lend me a looking-glass.
Said you so?
What, sir, not yet at rest?
O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted.
Puppet”?
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.
I do not, sir.
Teach me.
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.— Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office.
I “an itching palm”!
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
Ah sir, ah sir.
True, my good boy.—Come, bring us to this hovel.
You are unkind, Demetrius.
Sweet marjoram.
I thank you, sir.
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity.
There!
Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form.
Lead me on.
God almighty, There is some soul of goodness in things evil, Would men observingly distill it out.
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!
Was ever man so beaten?
Fare thee well.
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
With Cassio, mistress.
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber.
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
Judge me the world if ’tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms, Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weakens motion.
And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?
Thence I have followed it, Or it hath drawn me rather.
Whither should they come?
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.
All this”?
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times.
Delay this marriage for a month, a week.
Most noble Antony!
You are too much mistaken in this king.
Nor in thine, lord.
By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast.
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.
And die in music.
Mistress, how mean you that?
Farewell!—God knows when we shall meet again.
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.
If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich With the most noble blood of all this world.
My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth.
Hold, take thou that and that.
I will give you the minstrel.
I say amen to her.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon.
What might you think?
What makes that frontlet on?
Well.
Am I come near ye now?— Welcome, gentlemen!
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.
We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him.
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me.
He is ready at the door.
Kill the poys and the luggage!
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.
Where’s thy drum?
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
I know you what you are, And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named.
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy— Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue— A curse shall light upon the limbs of men.
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
He, woman.
Why, every day, tomorrow.
You all do know this mantle.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
Holy Franciscan Friar!
My life will be too short, And every measure fail me.
If you dare fight today, come to the field.
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.—Antony and Potpan!
Well, let him go.
Farewell.
Which of these is he?
Run to the Capulets.
No, his mouth is stopped.
I’ll come to him.
Nor I.
If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.
O, let me kiss that hand!
Here’s a spirit.
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
How canst thou make me satisfaction?
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you, it will make you mad.
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through.
And so, my lord, adieu.
Tis he.
Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
Have patience, I beseech.
Some comfort, Nurse.
How green!
I know the glove is a glove.
Let us toward the king.
Methinks you’re better spoken.
He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy dog.
What in the contrary?
Master, master, look about you.
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, Already at a point, was setting forth.
Nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice.
The English are embattled, you French peers.
The time to come.
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.
I do love nothing in the world so well as you.
Which be the malefactors?
What should I speak?
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges, Defective in their natures, grow to wildness, Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, The sciences that should become our country, But grow like savages, as soldiers will
If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.
Go in with me.
Now, Cinna.—Now, Metellus.—What, Trebonius, I have an hour’s talk in store for you.
I owe you none till I receive the chain.
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?
And therefore, good Grumio, the news.
But what’s the matter, Clarence?
Post to Salisbury.
Know you not the cause?
Therefore the sadness is without limit.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.
We doubt it nothing.
I could not stay behind you.
O, in the battle think on Buckingham, And die in terror of thy guiltiness.
Why, my boy?
Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters blessing.
Prithee, dispatch.
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves—
Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
Anon we’ll drink a measure The table round.
For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to.
What should he be?
Why hath thy queen Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
We are very sorry for’t.
Fly, masters!
For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.
Wilt thou be gone?
O the blessed gods!
Thus with a kiss I die.
Many a man would take you at your word And go indeed, having so good a mean.
Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.
We’ll wait upon your lordship.
So it appears by that I have to say.
Oh, where is Romeo?
I will do so.
Are you answered?
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
Iago, who began ’t?
You were best go in.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close, His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage, The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom, And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight.
I talked with no man at that hour, my lord.
Now to you.
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness.
Content thee, gentle coz.
Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while.
Honest Nurse, farewell.
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Poor soul!
Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate.
No doubt, my lord.
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
Go to thy cold bed and warm thee.
So rare a wondered father and a wife Makes this place paradise.
He is in earnest.
Grave sir, hail!
And then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
Give me answer to it.

But though they jump not on a just account— As in these cases, where the aim reports 'Tis oft with difference—yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
He is not yet arrived.
Then follow me and give me audience, friends.
But I will tarry.
This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.
And so, God be with him!
If it were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy, for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate.
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death and envy afterwards, For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself.
When he stands where I am and sees you there.  
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, Of the young prince your son.
What do you think?
I will answer you with gait and entrance.
Since that respects and fortunes are his love, I shall not be his wife.
Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all, Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves, And when I send for you, come hither masked.
I think it be, sir.
The will!
So said, so done, is well.
You must contrary me.
How cheerest thou, Jessica?
O sweet mistress, speak!
I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me.
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath.—But howsoev'r you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wracked, was landed, To be the lord on ’t.
Tis too bad, too bad.
Cassio’s my worthy friend— My lord, I see you’re moved.
Ay, indeed!
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, And vice sometime by action dignified.
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen, And, princely peers, a happy time of day.
Had I a glass, I would.
Dost grant me, hedgehog?
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue’s sweet air More tunable than lark to shepherd’s ear When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Fetch thy master home.
Good night, Lord Brutus.
I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
But brother Anthony—     Come, ’tis no matter.
Heavens thank you for ’t!
Come, come, let us thither.
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
Wherefore was that cry?
I’ll not to bed tonight.
Speak.
Out, tawny Tartar, out!
To prayers, to prayers, all lost!
We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis.
That “banishèd,” that one word “banishèd” Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.
Push home.
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch, Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep, Had the forehand and vantage of a king.
His son was but a ward two years ago.
But life itself, my wife, and all the world Are not with me esteemed above thy life.
Certain, men should be what they seem.
The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another’s heels, And many of the consuls, raised and met, Are at the Duke’s already.
Your Grace attended to their sugared words But looked not on the poison of their hearts.
What?
No pains, sir.
Lay them in gore, Since you have shore With shears his thread of silk.
But I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true.
Something, sure, of state, Either from Venice, or some unhatched practice Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit, and in such cases Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things, Though great ones are their object.
He did bewray his practice, and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.
I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier.
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?

I would my father looked but with my eyes.
I am cut to th' brains.
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
You hear how he importunes me.
I will, my lord.
Hail.
Then, with your will, go on.
Come, will you go with me?
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy.
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook.
Am I myself?
The slip, sir, the slip.
Thou 'rt mad to say it.
I will go seek him.—Cassio, walk hereabout.
There my Lysander and myself shall meet.
Good my sovereign, Take up the English short, and let them know Of what a monarchy you are the head.
O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this rainwater out o' door.
When spake I such a word?
But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar.
Romeo will answer it.
I have done.
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.

Now, forward with your tale.—Prithee, stand farther off.
Here, madam:     Conster them.
Now she’s gone for ever.— Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little.
The leisure and the fearful time Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love And ample interchange of sweet discourse, Which so-long-sundered friends should dwell upon.
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, Alone, in company, still my care hath been To have her matched.
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression?
So call the field to rest, and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day.
I hope they will not come upon us now.
Othello’s occupation’s gone.
And what should I do in Illyria?
Of Albany’s and Cornwall’s powers you heard not?

He will keep that good name still.
O, tell me, Friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge?
My lord, my lord— I will not hear you.
Not a false gallop.
I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.
Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the first stroke, I’ll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.
Come, come away.
It does, my boy.
Portia, what mean you?
As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for ’t.
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
We’ll away tonight, And be a day before our husbands home.
And therefore, I pray thee, news.
Here were the servants of your adversary, And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
Portia, art thou gone?

Most true.
Name what part I am for and proceed.
Fare ye well.

Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, As we do trace this alley up and down, Our talk must only be of Benedick.
For God’s sake, hold your hands.
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.
I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe.
You break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thanked, hurt not.—My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you.
You use this dalliance to excuse Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
There is none but he Whose being I do fear, and under him My genius is rebuked, as it is said Mark Antony’s was by Caesar.
I’ll do my best To woo your lady— Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
A grave?
What is the matter, husband?
None can be called deformed but the unkind.
I say a devil.
Nay, then, thus: We came into the world like brother and brother, And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another.
This may prove food to my displeasure.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, And strike you home without a messenger.
What’s to do?
What conquest brings he home?
Dost thou mock me?
I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him.

You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb, he could not therefore handle an English cudgel.
Obey thy parents, keep thy word’s justice, swear not, commit not with man’s sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on proud array.

Good sooth, even thus.
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad; Else would he never so demean himself.
I have done the deed.
Nurse?
Maintain a mourning ostentation, And on your family’s old monument Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites That appertain unto a burial.
How is ’t, brother!
Give me thy hand.
Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia— That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind?
He has a little galled me, I confess.
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?
Counterfeit?
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speakest well of fools!
Wrong not her birth.
He knows I know him well.
Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
Do not say so, Lysander.
I’ll entreat for thee.
Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.
Tell me, that I may sack The hateful mansion. 
Ay, my good lord.
Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.

Who knows he is?
Prithee, be content.
First, of my word!
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale And feeds from home.
What trade, thou knave?
He named Sebastian.
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
Lysander, speak again!
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
The barbarous Scythian, Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved As thou my sometime daughter.
You have been factious one against the other.— Wife, love Lord Hastings.
Dear my lord, Be not familiar with her.
Would not they speak?
All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.
Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
O, yes, my lord, but very idle words.
What is your difference?
Yet once again proclaim it publicly, If any friend will pay the sum for him, He shall not die; so much we tender him.
Thou liest.
No, but the barber’s man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuffed tennis balls.
Go you before, and I will follow you.
Think, my lord?” Alas, thou echo’st me As if there were some monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shown.
Twere damnation To think so base a thought.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices. 
Why, you gave no gold to me!
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he!—why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine.
Though it appear a little out of fashion, There is much care and valor in this Welshman.
How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight?

I could find in my heart to beat him—   But that the poor monster’s in drink.
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, Shrunk to this little measure?
But one word more— He will not be commanded.

The morning comes upon ’s.
Too well, too well.
By no means” what?
Fare you well.
Why, see you not?
As she is mine, I may dispose of her— Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death—according to our law Immediately provided in that case.
And I.
O Cassio, whence came this?
You are a lover.
Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
Ass, I doubt not.
What do I see on thee?
Away, go away!
Why, sir, a carpenter.
God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy.
I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness.
If what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were!
But that I do not.
He is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
Let me go.

I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
I have nothing to do with thee.
Trouble him no more Till further settling.
I should have been a sore one then.
Hast thou forgot thyself?
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any.
But mark, poor knight, What dreadful dole is here!
Would I were in an alehouse in London!

Under this conjuration, speak, my lord, For we will hear, note, and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism.
Do it quickly.
Who must hang them?
Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee.
That nature, which contemns its origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself.

That’s not so.
But who comes here?
Give me your blessing.
I dare avouch it, sir.
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald.

Masters, play here, I will content your pains.
Here, catch this casket.
And here he stands.
Iago is most honest.
Ay, past all surgery.
I say “amen.”
And yet no further than a wanton’s bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.
Do you know them?
Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.

The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover, Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank, Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs, Losing both beauty and utility.
Let him alone awhile.
Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so—” Am I made?
I know not.
But oh, how vile an idol proves this god!
I am not gamesome.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
Didst thou not say he comes?
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
The duke of York commends him to your Majesty.
Well met, my lord.
You are my elder.
Why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defense, To say I have done no harm?
Are you a god?
You told a lie, an odious, damnèd lie.
And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on.
I will have it all mine.
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning of all on your left.
Is ’t so, my lords of England?
I know not what to say.
Grace go with you, sir.
Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son.
I’ll not budge an inch, boy.

Would it be better, madam, than I am?
Ay, my good lord.
Macbeth doth come.
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor.
See, see, here comes the man we went to seek.
He, sir.
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor, for the goose carries not the fox.
Go, sirrah, seek him.
As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s leather have gone upon my handiwork.
I say I will make him eat some part of my leek, or I will peat his pate four days.—Bite, I pray you.
Our duties, and the pledge.
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
You received no gold?
Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister’s chamber up.
Your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust, and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will.
Out of my sight!
Maybe he is not well.
He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake.
Tis to be doubted, madam.
He was but a fool that brought My answer back.
For I am sick when I do look on thee.
My lord, there needs no such apology.
O lady, speak again!
I wonder what it bodes.
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.
And have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Tell me.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banishèd.
And do it with all thy heart.
Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see.
But have I fall'n, or no?
How know you he loves her?
Now, herald, are the dead numbered?
The son is fled.
Fear me not, man.
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years, And she was weaned—I never shall forget it— Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
You have stayed me in a happy hour.
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes.
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today.
Yes, madam.
Away with us to Athens.

The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season.
Oh!
What sayest thou, Biondello?
And so she did.
Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say “element,” but the word is overworn. 
Make that good.
But though thou art adjudgèd to the death, And passèd sentence may not be recalled But to our honour’s great disparagement, Yet will I favor thee in what I can.
For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once displayed, doth fall that very hour.
Hear his speech but say thou nought.
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, And fear’st to die?
Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Fetch Desdemona hither.
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.
And the best of me is diligence.
I gave him no order.
Your brother the Bastard is fled from Messina.
O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings.
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked?
Look, he wears cruel garters.
I thank thee.
Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.
This is all.
Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.
Lie with her?
It seems to me That yet we sleep, we dream.
I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there.
Indeed, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
Was ever match clapped up so suddenly?
Let’s stab ourselves.
In good time, sir, what’s that?
Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two, Or if not so, until the sun be set.
How say you now?
Tis passing good.
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
Prescribe not us our duty.
Scurvy knave!  
My lord it shall be done.
I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
It is not yet near day.
Tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan.
Oh well done!
Where have you hid yourself?
Know’st thou Fluellen?
If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself into stitches, follow me.
No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
This is the air, that is the glorious sun.
And made your other love, Demetrius— Who even but now did spurn me with his foot— To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare, Precious, celestial?
Go, good Tubal.
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide.
What handkerchief?
I long to know the truth hereof at large.
A husband?
Give me thy hand.
I would not deny you, but, by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.
The former Hero!
Then call we this the field of Agincourt, Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
To answer that, I should confess to you.
What men may do!
Well run, Thisbe!

They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
I dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart.
Made I him king for this?
For mine own good, All causes shall give way.
They stumble that run fast.
For shame, bring Juliet forth.

What, Lucius!
Sir Walter Herbert, a renownèd soldier; Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley, Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt, And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew, And many other of great name and worth; And towards London they do bend their power, If by the way they be not fought withal.
What, shall I find you here?
I am not in a sportive humor now.
But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Do not deny.
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
Beshrew his soul for me!
Go, go, dispatch.
This lion is a very fox, for his valor.
When he is best he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst he is little better than a beast.
Yes, I intend so.
Then, prophetlike, They hailed him father to a line of kings.
What news abroad?
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world, and having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
Lucentio is your name.
Sweet men, come to him.
For, as I am a soldier, A name that in my thoughts becomes me best, If I begin the batt'ry once again, I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie burièd.
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues, And she respects me as her only son.
My lord and master loves you.
What is his name?
I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
Look in the almanac.
One Angelo, a goldsmith.
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
I tell thee, man, ’tis better with me now Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet.
Let us leave him.
And come you now with “knocking at the gate”?
Which is Sebastian?
I pity thy complaining.
Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny.
I am no more mad than you are.
Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.
You hear him all night.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand, Make gallant show and promise of their mettle.
Father, what news?
Good madonna, why mournest thou?
It shall lose thee nothing.
Thou hast described A hot friend cooling.
I swear—      By nothing, for this is no oath.
Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.
These are news indeed!

How, how, Cordelia?
Let us therefore eat and drink.
I have a device to make all well.
Let us be satisfied!

Here, sir!
Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas; Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep, And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep; Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims,
You, Roderigo!
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.
I did not think you could have been so angry.
Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
No, but she let it drop by negligence And, to th' advantage, I being here, took ’t up.
Bid her come hither.
I know it well, sir.
Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.
What’s your grace’s will?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
What revels are in hand?
Yet poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
No, pray thee, let it serve for table talk.
What means that bloody knife?
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, That would reduce these bloody days again, And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
My soul is full of sorrow.
My lord.
Then I know My answer must be made.
I, sir?

What do they in the north When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
Come, there is sauce for it.
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
Speak to me.
I’ll fetch them, sir.
At Sardis once, And this last night here in Philippi fields.
Not a word of me.
Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning shall not shame me.
Somebody knocks.
But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endurèd riots.
Not here in presence.
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
I am hitherto your daughter.
And what said he?
Even so great men great losses should endure.
The powers of the kingdom approach apace.
Come hither, fellow.
You have not been abed, then?
Fare thee well.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights.
No more words.
Never king of England Had nobles richer, and more loyal subjects, Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
Good morrow to you both.
Let it be so.
I would not be mad.
And so far am I glad it so did sort, As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
At first And last, the hearty welcome.
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
What was the second noise for?
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i' th' middle on ’s face?

Indeed?
Here’s Lucentio, right son to the right Vincentio, That have by marriage made thy daughter mine While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
Need you my help?
Ring the alarum bell.
Know him?
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me.
Nor no man else.
Amen to that, sweet powers!
Go to, go to.
Nothing, my lord.
Good morrow, noble sir.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
Father, in.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
O woeful day!
Thou liest, thou shag-haired villain!
what mistress, slave, hast thou?
More of this matter cannot I report.
Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words.
It was.
What counterfeit did I give you?
Come they of noble family?
This is the fruits of whoring.
But where unbruisèd youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Make all the money thou canst.
How?
I will be satisfied.
Well, let it be.— What ho, Malvolio!
A pack of blessings light upon thy back, Happiness courts thee in her best array,
I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now.
Soon at five o'clock, Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart And afterward consort you till bedtime.
Up, up, and see The great doom’s image!
O noble Caesar!
I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.
Is it so long?— Call forth the holy father.
If she live long, And in the end meet the old course of death, Women will all turn monsters.
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you.— Come, my dear love, The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue: That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.
So indeed he did.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return.
Arrest him, officer.
What’s the matter?
Madman and beggar too.
Nay, but I bar tonight.
And when he saw my best alarumed spirits, Bold in the quarrel’s right, roused to the encounter, Or whether ghasted by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled.
So I will, my liege, as I live.
Let’s all sink wi' th' king.
If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs.
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
For many miles about There’s scarce a bush.
You strike my people, and your disordered rabble Make servants of their betters.
Why, lady!
You know no Centaur?
I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father.
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor, And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.— Good Master Doctor, see him safe conveyed Home to my house.
If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.
An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged. 
I have it, And soundly too.
Why then, you are in love.
Wilt break my heart?
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
About the ninth hour, lady.
If it please you.
I will carry no crotchets.
Disloyal?
Her father is Baptista Minola, An affable and courteous gentleman.
Peace, ho!
I only speak right on.
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban’s sheep— This Jacob from our holy Abram was, As his wise mother wrought in his behalf, The third possessor, ay, he was the third— And what of him?
I’ll leave you.
What dogs are these!
Our knocking has awaked him.
Is my lord angry?
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
Haste thee for thy life.
Having once this juice, I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
Hie to high fortune!
Let me be satisfied.
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
Most certain.
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us, for they bear them on their shoulders.
Rebellious dead, rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath To time and mortal custom.
I tell you, ’tis incredible to believe How much she loves me.
Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble, Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied, And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince And all of them that thus dishonor her.
And you all know, security Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
What is that noise?
For several virtues Have I liked several women.
When our actions do not, Our fears do make us traitors.
Are they all ready?
He’s dead.
Thy lover,      Artemidorus” Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, And as a suitor will I give him this.
Nay, that you shall not.
Pluck out his eyes.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation.
You see her eyes are open.
Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
Thy father hath his life.
Not yet.
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
Good morrow, brother Bedford.
Sweet Desdemona!
I’ll wait upon your Lordship.
It were an honest action to say So to the Moor.
Come, come!
But, room, fairy!
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe.
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
Is supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding garment on?
Let him send no more— Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it.
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart, Unprunèd, dies.
Let me entreat you.
Before me, she’s a good wench.
How now, gentleman?
I pray thee, give it me.
No.
Hast thou found my daughter?
You have no stomach, Signior.
Caesar, ’tis strucken eight.
What had he done to you?
Faith, none but Humfrey Hower, that called your Grace To breakfast once, forth of my company.
For this night, to bed, and dream on the event.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
I am glad of it.
But I know to be up late is to be up late.
Night hangs upon mine eyes.
Peter, didst ever see the like?
Well contented.
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.— Joy, gentle friends!
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
There is no power in Venice Can alter a decree establishèd.
You kill me to deny it.
That she may long live here, God say amen.
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.
An if I be, sir, is it any offense?
The tyranny of the open night’s too rough For nature to endure.
Muffle me, night, awhile.
The knave counterfeits well.
In brief, for so the season bids us be, Prepare thy battle early in the morning, And put thy fortune to the arbitrament Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
Very well, madam.
No more.
Now he importunes him To tell it o'er.
Why, very well then.
My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbors you as her kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders.
You have a daughter called Elizabeth, Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
Life and these lips have long been separated.
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
It is so.
Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment?
We must not now displease him.
What, is the man lunatic?
What, is he dead?
Then I defy you, stars!
I’ll rather kill myself.
Your servant shall do so.
Th' affair cries haste And speed must answer it.
Let him fly far.
Canst thou blame him?
I would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it.
Yes, that thou didst.
Oh, she was heavenly true!
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods, Have with our needles created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key, As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds, Had been incorporate.
Fear me not.— She and the duke her husband!
Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone.
No.
Nothing, my lord, or if—I know not what.
Yet hear me, countrymen.
But, for your conscience?
We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
My dukedom to a beggarly denier, I do mistake my person all this while!
We have been up and down to seek him.
We’ll go to supper i' th' morning.
We are the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find- faults, as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss.
Show.
I loved him, friend— No father his son dearer.
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
And this, Metellus Cimber.
O woeful sympathy, Piteous predicament!
How shall we then behold their natural tears?
The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship—   But, hark!
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
Not yet, my cousin.
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone.
I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son Dove-drawn with her.
How now, you dog?
I’ll wear none but this.
The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain, The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.
Is there a murderer here?
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.
I thank you.
It shall be done.
Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor.
Despair and die!
Yea, or to paint himself?
Now, where’s my wife?
I deny it not.
The red plague rid you For learning me your language!
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost; It yearns me not if men my garments wear; Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
Good e'en, good e'en.
Oh, ’tis a gallant king!
Hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear.
O God’s lady dear, Are you so hot?
Is it come to this?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
He always loved our sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly. 
Give me,”      quoth I.
And be assured you’ll find a difference, As we his subjects have in wonder found, Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now.
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
You must away tonight.
My lord shall never rest, I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience.
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
You do love my lord.
But I will punish home.
May it be done?
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
I’ll make division of my present with you.
These are gracious drops.
Why, look you how you storm!
Advise the duke where you are going, to a most festinate preparation.
And discourse fustian with one’s own shadow?
How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip.
This was a merry message.
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
Give me leave.— I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, That hearing of her beauty and her wit, Her affability and bashful modesty, Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior, Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house, to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard.
Do you love me?
For indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body.
Meet me by and by at the citadel.
Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything.
And are not you my husband?
Yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity, But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings.
Fie, for shame!
Out and alas, that was my lady’s voice.
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep.
Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake.
I have no food for thee.
O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm, But thus his simple truth must be abused With silken, sly, insinuating jacks?
Read the will.
Intelligence is given where you are hid.
It doth not fit me.
I do not know you so good a man as myself.
Are you there, wife?
Oh, ’tis foul in her.
The world affords no law to make thee rich.
Dorset, embrace him.—Hastings, love Lord Marquess.
Stand, an you be a man.
No.
Friar, it cannot be.
What should that bode?
She doth well.
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee, But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
This shall determine that.
But let her live.
Bliss be upon you!
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
Not in love neither?
How does he love me?
I will confess it to all the 'orld.
My voice is now the king’s, my looks mine own.
Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
What says the golden chest?
For me, I’ll not be gone till I please myself.
Was I with you there for the goose?
Did she see thee the while, old boy?
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier’s nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit.
The heart is sorely charged.
What is your pleasure?
I, sir, am Dromio.
You are not, Cassius.
Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
I know my remedy.
Here comes Thisbe.
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
When all’s done, You look but on a stool.
Speak, if you can: what are you?
I am content you shall entreat me stay, But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
I frown the while, and perchance wind up watch, or play with my—some rich jewel.
I’ll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.
O' Thursday be it, then.— Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal.
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
O momentary grace of mortal men, Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
Ay, sir.
Most heathenish and most gross!
What is this same?
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats.
My affections Are then most humble.
He followed you.
For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, Lions with toils, and men with flatterers.
Beat him enough.
They do offend our sight.
But while I say one prayer!
Take that, and that.
And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt, The organs, though defunct and dead before, Break up their drowsy grave and newly move, With casted slough and fresh legerity.
For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio.
One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
Perhaps I will return immediately.
An if I could, what should I get therefore?
For my part, I am so attired in wonder I know not what to say.
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant, Who put unluckily into this bay Against the laws and statutes of this town, Beheaded publicly for his offense.
I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.
I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is.
Therefore be double damned, Swear thou art honest!
Yet I will adventure.
I pray you tell me.
Suffolk first died, and York, all haggled over, Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face.
Why, madam, have I offered love for this, To be so flouted in this royal presence?
How dost thou, my good fellow?
Her only fault, and that is faults enough, Is that she is intolerable curst, And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure That, were my state far worser than it is, I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped.
This is the fairy land.
The whole butt, man.
What need’st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?
My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
A dire induction am I witness to, And will to France, hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Honest, my lord?
Speak softly.
He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side, But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.
Is there more toil?
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace.
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, That we have had no time to move our daughter.
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.
I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
And what noise is this?
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
Nay, I have offered all, I have no more, And she can have no more than all I have.
Come away, servant, come.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Offended us you have not, but the king.
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain, Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.
So is the dearest o' th' loss.
God will revenge it, whom I will importune With earnest prayers, all to that effect.
They will surely do us no harm.
Tomorrow, as he purposes.
Away!
Nothing, unless you render her again.
The king’s son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring—then, like reeds, not hair— Was the first man that leaped, cried, “Hell is empty And all the devils are here.”      Why, that’s my spirit!
You gentle Romans—     Peace, ho!
If I should speak, She would mock me into air.
Yes, nightingales answer daws!
I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs.
Do not torment me, prithee.
Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee!
And how doth she?
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend.
Is ’t so, indeed.
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed.
Tis nine o'clock.
In her consists my happiness and thine.
I do not know dat.
This is the man, this is Antonio, To whom I am so infinitely bound.
Sir, I say to you we are none.
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone.
And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i' th' wind.

Know you not he has?
Then forth, dear countrymen.
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine.
Eight score eight hours?
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
It is, and wants but nomination.
I must confess your offer is the best, And, let your father make her the assurance, She is your own; else, you must pardon me.
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, Misprizing what they look on, and her wit Values itself so highly that to her All matter else seems weak.
The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear— The one in motley here, The other found out there.
I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.
What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?
And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection, But by your setting on, by your consent?
Look, with a spot I damn him.
Tear him to pieces.
Hark, now I hear them.
This way, my lord.
Think of me as you please.
This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet.
Come with a thought.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
Deny to speak with me?
I’ll in to counsel them.

Make haste, make haste, sirrah.
Alack, for mercy!
And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” nor after my degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—what can be said?
Why, how now, daughter Katherine?
Stay till I have read the letter.
O cousin, cousin!

Here I am.
Pronounce this sentence then: Women may fall when there’s no strength in men.
What woman’s man?

Uncle, I must come forth.
I am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.

Sir, sir, be patient.
Was that done like Cassius?

While that the armèd hand doth fight abroad, Th' advisèd head defends itself at home.
Hey, Mountain, hey!
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace.
O ye gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife!
What cursèd foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
And to that end we wished your Lordship here T' avoid the censures of the carping world.
Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
Then ’tis he: the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i' th' court.
Who is ’t you mean?
But I have cause to pry into this pedant.
For the meat, sir, it shall be covered.
I am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i' th' world.
You are well fleshed.
Let her have your voice.
Out o' your wits and hearing too?
Master, if you do, expect spoon meat; or bespeak a long spoon.
Sir, are not you my father?
I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously— Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent.
What shall I do?
Kind sister, thanks.
If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.
Leonato, stand I here?
There is no more but so.
Oh, bloody period!
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
Yet, in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army. 
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, To countenance this horror!
Come, mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company.
Stephano is my name, and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont.
Tis no such matter.
Tis three o'clock, and, Romans, yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight.
Let go his arm.
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
So, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.
Thou torturest me, Tubal.
I think the world’s asleep.
Thou wouldst make a good fool.
Because I would not see thy cruèl nails Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
Ha, art thou bedlam?
She had a song of “Willow,” An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it.
What think’st thou then of Stanley?
Come, my fair Cordelia.

I know her father, though I know not her, And he knew my deceasèd father well.
That handkerchief thou speak’st of I found by fortune and did give my husband.
Your Honor wins bad humors.
Know you any, count?
Never at quiet.
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed!
There is, there is.
This, Decius Brutus.
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo— By the bad voice.
We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before ’t.
Yield, cur.
Tush, fear not, man.

Look with thine ears.
Not a word.

How now, Shylock?
Spit, fire!
In his tongue.
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed too, ’tis a foul thing.
M”—why, that begins my name.
Go, leave me.
Is she so hot a shrew as she’s reported?
What should I do?
How came her eyes so bright?
Nor will you tender less.
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, That I, being governed by the watery moon, May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world.
Fly not.
Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.
He takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you.
I saw no man use you at his pleasure.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.
Get you therefore hence, Poor miserable wretches, to your death, The taste whereof God of His mercy give You patience to endure, and true repentance Of all your dear offences.—Bear them hence.
Howling attends it.
These ears of mine, thou know’st did hear thee.
Those that were your father’s enemies Have steeped their galls in honey, and do serve you With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
Say it, Othello.
But fare you well.
Hast stolen it from her?
Hath Romeo slain himself?
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
Alack, for pity!
I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks Which I will practice.
My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear.
With who?
Shall I entreat a word?
That now Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition.
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
Why let it strike?
I am a gentleman of a company.
And when was he wont to wash his face?
Your graces are right welcome.
Relent, and save your souls.
A match!
Stand still.
My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.
Then is courtesy a turncoat.
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say, “These are their reasons.
Here’s our chief guest.
What beast was ’t, then, That made you break this enterprise to me?
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
Tis he.
They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.

Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love.
You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern.
Are they “informed” of this?
The town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the breach, and we talk and, be Chrish, do nothing, ’tis shame for us all.
Let’s have the tongs and the bones.
Your Majesty says very true.
No.
Thou canst not.
I am young, but something You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb T' appease an angry god.
I’ll play the housewife for this once.
The king, His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted, And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay.
Heaven doth truly know it.
Our dinner done and he not coming thither, I went to seek him.
In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
Some are born great—”
I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it.
Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.
Have at the very eye of that proverb with “A pox of the devil.”  You are the better at proverbs, by how much “A fool’s bolt is soon shot.”  You have shot over.

Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls.
Thou art a strange fellow.
Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?
We follow thee.—Juliet, the county stays.

Pray God, he keep his oath!
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time
In, or we are spoiled.

Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court?
O brave new world, That has such people in ’t!
Whither will you that I go To answer this your charge?
I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
There lies the duke asleep, and there the keys.
I never gave him cause.
Adieu.
Ay, but not frighted me.
You durst not so have tempted him.
Who brought it?
I heard thee say even now thou lik’st not that When Cassio left my wife.
I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.
That’s a question.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
But is he often thus?
Therefore speak.
Ay, good my lord.
In those freckles live their savors.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord’s return.

Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
I am no fighter.
Good morrow, masters.
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone, Having displeased my father, to Lawrence’s cell To make confession and to be absolved.
Do, do.
Go you with me and I will use your skill.— Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.
Go to, charm your tongue.
I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child.
Sometime I’d divide, And burn in many places.
Ha, ha!
Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield.
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
Hark!
If you come slack of former services, You shall do well.
Give me my sin again.
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?
Away, and let me die.
Do you come near me now?
But for the whole world?
Tis she must do ’t, And, lo, the happiness!
Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape, Heaven forgive him too.
I must go in.
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I’ll believe thee.
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
Show me briefly how.
Where is the number of our English dead?
Was ever man so weary?
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.— Egeus, I will overbear your will.
No, thou proud dream, That play’st so subtly with a king’s repose.
Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead.
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
Therefore  You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side.
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
Do ’t, knight.
Most gracious Duke, To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice, T' assist my simpleness.
I will see them.
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.   
I and my bosom must debate awhile, And then I would no other company.
Ay, with a twink.
O most happy hour!
Make haste.
And did you see the handkerchief?
What need one?
Oh, that I were a man!
O most unhappy strumpet!
But, I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.
In practice let us put it presently.
It is a hint That wrings mine eyes to ’t.
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorred commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine, within which rift Imprisoned thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike.
And let us do it with no show of fear, No, with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance.
Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death?
Saint Davy’s day is past.
Then show it me.
Plantagenet.
There to meet with Macbeth.
I this infer: That many things, having full reference To one consent, may work contrariously, As many arrows loosèd several ways Come to one mark, as many ways meet in one town, As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea, As many lines close in the dial’s center, So may a thousand actions, once afoot, End in one purpose, and be all well borne Without defeat.
Can no prayers pierce thee?
Bring me a father that so loved his child, Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine, And bid him speak of patience.
I see the business.
Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure.
Give me your hand first.  
Oh, heaven forgive us!
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.
Will ’t please you taste of what is here?
They could not, would not do ’t.
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time, But I will watch you from such watching now.
Adieu.
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers.
Iago?
Will your grace command me any service to the world’s end?
It was my duty, sir.
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you.
What, ho?
Twenty crowns.
But I confess, sir, that we were locked out.
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed, But on his knees at meditation; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans, But meditating with two deep divines; Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
Do we all holy rites.
Come, sire, no more.—What, Oswald, ho!
She hath good leave.
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation.
But, let me see, by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.
I would have my bond.
In himself he is.
Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the staves' end as well as a man in his case may do.
That were the most if he should   husband you.
She’s dead as earth.
He cannot prevail with me.
But by and by comes back to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained revenge, And to ’t they go like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain.
Are you sure That we are awake?
O, what men dare do!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, But one thing to rejoice and solace in, And cruel death hath catched it from my sight!
The competitors enter.
Go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber window entered, even the night before her wedding day.
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
What is thy name?
And, gentle master, I received no gold.
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
For she is wise, if I can judge of her.
I will walk up and down here and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.
Tomorrow dinner, then?
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love a great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia.
Hold!
No, by no means.
Oh, wretched villain!
I say “thy husband”—dost understand the word?
I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.
Get you to your lord.
You speak too bitterly.
My words are as full of peace as matter.
Enter, sir, the castle.
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown.
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man.
Oh, he is gone indeed.
There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.
O, no!
Feed and regard him not.
I hear it now above me.
A cup, closed in my true love’s hand?
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.
Ay.
What say you?
In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in arms, And every hour more competitors Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.
Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Who comes here?
And were the king on ’t, what would I do?
Hold, there’s half my coffer.
My soul, and not my child!
It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
I have been to seek you.
Macbeth!
Some must go off.
But what talk I of this?
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul.
There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.
Why is this reasoned?
A maiden never bold, Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blushed at herself.
Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull, On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale, Killing their fruit with frowns?
Tis Banquo’s then.
The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
I was adored once too.
Unwilling, I agreed.
But what say you to Thursday?
That shall be by and by.
But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? 
Amen.
They flatter me.
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
Yes, they have.
I tell you, Captain, if you look in the maps of the 'orld, I warrant you shall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike. 
Call the clotpoll back.
He shall see none to fear.
Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut.
What, go you toward the Tower?
Be ruled by me; depart in patience, And let us to the Tiger all to dinner, And about evening come yourself alone To know the reason of this strange restraint.
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more.
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.
Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
He lies not like the living.
The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones.
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
Nay, good Lysander.
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And “Tailor!” cries, and falls into a cough, And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there.
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight.
His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend.
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
Your sword upon a woman?
Challenge me the count’s youth to fight with him.
Give me my sword.
O, then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!
Why then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish.
Shall I hear from you anon?
I hid me under the dead mooncalf’s gaberdine for fear of the storm.
Thou know’st my lodging.
That he hath usèd thee.
We are haunted.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live.
The madly used Malvolio.”  Did he write this?
Madam!
What three things does drink especially provoke?
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?
You have said now.
His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
Give ear, sir, to my sister.
The testament!
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
You best know the place.
Come, your answer in broken music, for thy voice is music and thy English broken.
Harder, harder.
It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.
I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
Do not think it so unwholesome.
Nothing but this: your true love for my master.
Who comes here?
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
How now, Oswald?
Thou praisest the worst best.
Why, man?
Do you see, gentlemen?
There lies that Tybalt.
Tis much.—Servants, leave me and her alone.
Where is he?
Master, for my hand, Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
Then be thou jocund.
I humbly take my leave.
There was blow for blow.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
Hear you, my lords—     We have some haste, Leonato.
I shall answer for her.
Touched you the bastardy of Edward’s children?
Chopped logic!
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
Oh, coward that I am, to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
I hate a drunken rogue. 
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
A credulous father, and a brother noble— Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none, on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy.
But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you.
How goes the night, boy?
You have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
About the wood go swifter than the wind, And Helena of Athens look thou find— All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer, With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.
All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement Inhabits here.
My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.
Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.
Call you this “gamut”?
It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which, for traffic’s sake, Most of our city did.
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both!
Thieves!
I know he loves me well.
My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.
How now, how now?
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
This thou shalt answer.
The next thing then she waking looks upon— Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey or on busy ape— She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
If, sir, perchance She have restrained the riots of your followers, 'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end As clears her from all blame.
Let him not come near me.
Never, my lord.
Sweet mistress—what your name is else I know not, Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,—
Take up my mistress' gown to his master’s use!
Heaven and earth!
And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
I, madam?
Fare you well.
What you have charged me with, that have I done— And more, much more.
And, as thou badest me, In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after-supper and bedtime?
They have tied me to a stake.
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go and presently call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of a knave.
What beard were I best to play it in?
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France—I cannot tell wat is  To kiss.
Speed him hence.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking.
Hear you aught of her in yours?
Dismiss me.
Wilt thou provoke me?
Be assured you may.
There is time enough.
So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical.
I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
In such a night Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew, Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
With what addition?
I cannot fly, But, bearlike, I must fight the course.
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Come.
Or rather, do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not, nor I cannot, love you?
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight.
Let them set on at once, for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing, And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
And I the king shall love thee.
Why, what is that to you?
A marvelous witty fellow, I assure you, but I will go about with him.—Come you hither, sirrah, a word in your ear.
Do not break off so, For we may pity though not pardon thee.
Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
When the butt is out, we will drink water.
Wherefore, sweetheart?
Name them.
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself, And ’tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself.
It is determined, not concluded yet; But so it must be if the king miscarry.
Heaven rest them now.
What may I call your name?
And for their sake, In your fair minds let this acceptance take.
Madam my interpreter, what says she?
Go waken Juliet.
Vengeance, plague, death, confusion!
What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench, and all grease, and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
No sovereignty—     Yet he would be king on ’t.
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey, Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me.
Fail not our feast.
Where is he?
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no— So, thrice fair lady, stand I even so, As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed, signed, ratified by you.
He was the wretched’st thing when he was young, So long a-growing and so leisurely, That if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
Good, speak to th' mariners.
Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
I do repent me that I put it to you.
I have years on my back forty- eight.
Come on.
What, are there masques?
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
Ay, sir.
Now sit we close about this taper here And call in question our necessities.
Let me enjoy my private.
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither.
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.
Never was monarch better feared and loved Than is your Majesty.
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong—for with her death That tidings came—with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster.
How now, my lord!
Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?
Hark, what noise is this?
But did you ever tell him she was false?
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me.
Thy husband.
Soft!
In Syracusa was I born, and wed Unto a woman happy but for me, And by me, had not our hap been bad.
Talk not to me.
tis a lost fear.
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught.
Welcome home, Grumio.

That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh To raise my fortunes.
Pardon me.
Three months from twelve, then.
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir.
Unreal mockery, hence!
You must bear with me.
Once more, what news?
Very easily possible.
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband.
Too old to be engaged to young.
Listen but speak not to ’t.
The gods defend her!—hear him hence awhile.
Oh, this is it that makes your servants droop!
We must both give and take, my loving lord.
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse, Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
That I ask again, For nothing can be ill if she be well.
And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here The mettle of your pasture.
Leave me with haste.
The urging of that word “judgment” hath bred a kind of remorse in me.
Princes and counties!
So let it be with Caesar.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale.

Ay.
Run after that same peevish messenger, The county’s man.

But, as he was ambitious, I slew him.
All this is so, but what of this, my lord?
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not.
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
Let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse-tail till they kiss their hands.
There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d.
Nay, get thee gone.
If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer.
I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus!

I found it in my chamber, And he himself confessed but even now That there he dropped it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire.
Oh, devil, devil!
That I did for him.
In wisdom I should ask thy name.
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.
And let no man abide this deed But we the doers.
Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.
But shall I live in hope?
There is no obstruction in this.
Ay, my good lord.
I prithee let me hear it.
Now, Antony, our hopes are answerèd.
And, gentle friends, Let’s kill him boldly but not wrathfully.
I answer you?
Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop?
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
Hence!
Or I’ll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth. 
She is indeed perfection.
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
Good e'en, brother.
This is Signor Antonio.
The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn.
Is he well?
I’ll call upon you straight.
He is my dear friend, an please you.
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my fortunes.
Prithee, peace.
As I discern, It burneth in the Capels' monument.
And, as the jest did glance away from me, 'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
Welcome, ass.
Use lenity, sweet chuck.
Speak, I charge you.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.
But since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
The glove which I have given him for a favor May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear.
Here comes Baptista.
I mean in singing.
Why, so didst thou.
Oh, Oh, Oh!
He would be crowned.
Oh, monstrous!

And what of him, Tranio?
You make me study of that.
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
I’ll sell all my land.
All for our vantage.
Sit you too.
For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted.
Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
But, oh, vain boast!
Here comes my man.
Madam wife, they say that I have dreamed And slept above some fifteen year or more.
Kent, father, sisters!
And yet for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing.
It is but trash.
We shall find of him A shrewd contriver.

To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace?
Good sister, wrong me not nor wrong yourself, To make a bondmaid and a slave of me.

Good fool, for my brother’s death.
She that makes dainty, She, I’ll swear, hath corns.
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power  To seal th' accuser’s lips.
I promise you I scarcely know myself.
If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.

The watchdogs bark.
Why do they run away?
Ay, on the front.
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.

But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year older than this, who yet is no dearer in my account.
Let us go in, And charge us there upon interr'gatories, And we will answer all things faithfully.

Lear’s shadow.
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit, And thence to France shall we convey you safe And bring you back, charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass; for, if we may, We’ll not offend one stomach with our play.
Is not that strange?
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
Farewell.
I never felt it till now—Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels.
So fare you well till we shall meet again.
Here, madam, at your service.
Hail!
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
The time will bring it out.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
To thee I do commend my watchful soul, Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.
How say you, lady?
Ay, good fool.
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'errun her lovely face, She was the fairest creature in the world— And yet she is inferior to none.
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
Here, sir, but trouble him not.

Look up a-height.
For when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.

Knock, knock, knock!
In a false quarrel there is no true valor.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking.
Give me thy torch, boy.
Tis too late to go to bed now.
Let me come to her.
Let us to the field.
I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
This is practice, Gloucester.
The gown is made Just as my master had direction.
Whom should I knock?
Take thou that.
I speak no treason.
Tis better as it is.
I was born to speak all mirth and no  matter.
Let me ask you one word in private.

For God’s sake, a pot of small ale.
He bears him like a portly gentleman, And, to say truth, Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.
Feed him with apricoks and dewberries, With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.
Will you walk towards him?
With much, much more dismay I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
Take their examination yourself and bring it me.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return.

Alas, too soon We came aboard.
Have not you love enough to bear with me, When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful?
We must follow the leaders.
My lord, I have considered in my mind The late request that you did sound me in.
Go to, mum, you are he.
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
You hear the suit.
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding day.
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode.
My lord is dead.
Yes, other men have ill luck too.
My master’s a very Jew.
Yet I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone.
I must discontinue your company.
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
How chance the king comes with so small a train?
Oh yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had, That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kissed the Cretan strand.
She’s not well married that lives married long, But she’s best married that dies married young.
My prayers, minx?
No.
Jove shield thee well for this!
No, indeed, my lord.
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua.

Here is a place reserved, sir.
When you are gentle, you shall have one too, And not till then.
As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it.
God hath blessed you with a good name.
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
Cassio knows you not.
And I.
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not.
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home.
Octavius, lead your battle softly on, Upon the left hand of the even field.
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses, Therefore use none.
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
Go, prepare for dinner.
I have forgot your name, but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.
Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em?
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest, For I did dream of money bags tonight.
This pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
Awake!
Here I’ll sit i' th' midst.
This is the place.
A good swift simile, but something currish.
If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.” O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head, With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart—

Go you and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived.

Go to, farewell.
The Fairyland buys not the child of me.
Now welcome, Kate, and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee.
I am changed.
Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
Not so, my lord.
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
And to deal plainly I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
This is well.
Is ’t so saucy?
Hang thou there upon the tomb, Praising her when I am dumb.
Nay, and I will.
And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver.

Here lay Duncan, His silver skin laced with his golden blood, And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance; there, the murderers, Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore.
Come to what is important in ’t.
The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy.
Will ’t please your Honor taste of these conserves?
Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks.
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
What are you?
I have said.
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round”— I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
I say I love thee more than he can do.
I had forgot the reward.
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.
Oh, ho, monster, we know what belongs to a frippery.—   Put off that gown, Trinculo.
If he were dead, you’d weep for him.
Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee.

What, my lord?
Shut up your doors.
The  I thank you.
I never saw you in my life till now.
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
Come, let’s do so.
Awake, I say!
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot, Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
This lanthorn doth the hornèd moon present.
But did I never speak of all that time?
Have you a soul or sense?
Give him a halter.
That I have labored With all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavors, To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview, Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.
Please ’t your highness To grace us with your royal company?
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
None that I more love than myself.
I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty Against thee presently if thou dar’st stand.
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.
Thou protector of this damnèd strumpet, Talk’st thou to me of “ifs”?

He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
No.
She is thine own.— What, Ariel!
I will to Venice.
Now, by yon marble heaven, In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words.
Why, ’tis a cockle or a walnut shell, A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap.
They are, my lord.
But do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath, when every drop of blood That every Roman bears—and nobly bears— Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him.
It wearies me; you say it wearies you.
I was a gentleman, And then I told you true.
Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no!
Taste your legs, sir.
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
Go, get thee gone, I say.
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
Oh, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
Famine is in thy cheeks.
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.

Thou art a villain!
Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.
Farewell.
He is well paid that is well satisfied.

What news more?
Avaunt, you cullions!
Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you.
I do not know One of my sex, no woman’s face remember— Save, from my glass, mine own.
Saint Valentine is past.
Then wherefore should I doubt?
Let me see.
Use me but as your spaniel—spurn me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me.
Your brother Gloucester hates you.
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
In cash, most justly paid.
Be bloody, bold, and resolute.
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
Here lies the county slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm and newly dead, Who here hath lain these two days buried.— Go, tell the Prince.
Nay, good Sir Toby.
Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die.
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.
Say then my peace is made.
The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell, Ere they shall make us weep.
Come, come, You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.
How doth the lady?
Hail, brave friend!
Welcome from Mantua.
I will confess to you that I love him.

Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will.
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.

Look you, Cassio and my husband!
Where is Montjoy the herald?
Then, if they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited.
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
Why, no, sir.
So I am—to let him live.
And let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.
No woman’s heart So big, to hold so much.
These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone.

Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case.
You speak to Casca, and to such a man That is no fleering telltale.
Returned so soon?
The time has been That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end.
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail.
He is wise, And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
The order was reversed.
And as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night?
What is my offense?
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
Uncouple in the western valley.
I must be gone.
Farewell.
I will o'erlook thy paper.
Dispute it like a man.
Until I know this sure uncertainty I’ll entertain the offered fallacy.
Strike!

Why sinks that cauldron?
Farewell the plumèd troops and the big wars That makes ambition virtue!
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing.
Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
Is that the chain you promised me today?
Go, girl.
Hold, sir, here’s my purse.
O brave monster!
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water.
Post-post-haste, dispatch.
Rumble thy bellyful!
This is the man.
Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father.
Go.
A match!

Consider then we come but in despite.
The constable of France.
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
A plague o' both your houses!
Send for the man and ask him.
Tear him, tear him!
Where is my lady?
As thou got’st Milan, I’ll come by Naples.
Excellent well!
Sue to him again and he’s yours.
Is not that he?
Oh, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them.
Peace be with Burgundy.
More knocking.
Whence is that knocking?
As he was valiant, I honor him.
Can heaven be so envious?
You shall have leave.
Is he not jealous?
The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest.
You are both sure, and will assist me?
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the bark  The fellow is distract, and so am I, And here we wander in illusions.
Where are they?
Where is the king?
I have not seen him this two days.
Before the days of change, still is it so.
A calendar, a calendar!
Hurt him in eleven places.
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth.
The villain is much lighter-heeled than I. I followed fast, but faster he did fly, That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel’s hoard and fetch thee new nuts.
Here, my lord.
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
Ha!
To feed were best at home; From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.
You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
Why, so didst thou.
On Tuesday noon, or night, or Wednesday morn.
Here, Fluellen, wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap.
When I have plucked thy rose I cannot give it vital growth again, It must needs wither.
If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue forever, and live the beloved of your brother,       Edgar.”  Hum, conspiracy?
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home.
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
God’s bread!
I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all, All, all cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.
Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony.
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
What, up and down, carved like an apple tart?
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.
Help me hence, ho!
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
I beseech your pardon.
Come, sir, I pray you, go.
What news?
Thou dost not mark me.
A friend.
Ay, my lord.
O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither, For he was fitter for that place than earth.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour It will be well.
Oh, the cry did knock Against my very heart!
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
Ah, my tender babes, My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets, If yet your gentle souls fly in the air And be not fixed in doom perpetual, Hover about me with your airy wings And hear your mother’s lamentation.
O, welcome, father!
Out, you green sickness, carrion!
Besides, they have burned and carried away all that was in the king’s tent, wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat.
Of your complexion.
Therefore get you on and give him his desire.
I pray you, sir, take patience.
Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house.
Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes.
All hail, Macbeth!
If you did wed my sister for her wealth, Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness.
And I am sick when I look not on you.
Sir, I will answer any thing.
I humbly thank your ladyship.
It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk.
Till then, enough. 
I am the very man— I’ll see that straight.
Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.
Her eyes are fierce, but thine Do comfort and not burn.
Let go my hand.
Portia, forgive me this enforcèd wrong, And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself—     Mark you but that!
Oh, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them so That heaven’s vault should crack.
She’s busy, and she cannot come!” Is that an answer?
O gull!
Most monstrous, oh!
So should he look That seems to speak things strange.
No, I’ll not weep.
All myself?
If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Shall I speak a word in your ear?
Good sentences, and well pronounced.
And they have conspired together.
Well, happiness to their sheets!
Shut doors after you.
But, Othello, speak.
The fool will stay.
Let’s ha' ’t, good Grumio.
The night has been unruly.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?— Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus, I have found great love amongst them.
Sir, sir, sir—
Bespeak him a fortnight before.—I will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.—Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue.
Tis true.
Pray you do not, sir.
You know not why we came to visit you— Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown, But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
News, old news, and such news as you never heard of!
I am ashamèd I did yield to them.
Tell him so yourself, And see how he will take it at your hands.
No child but Hero; she’s his only heir.
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To resurvey them, we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer.
No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days.
It did always seem so to us.
Now die, die, die, die, die.
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.
If ever thou come to me and say, after tomorrow, “This is my glove,” by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
But till this afternoon his passion Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
Give me another horse!
He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him, His grace not being warned thereof before.
Well, my dread lord—so must I call you now.
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.
Adultery?
You mock me, madam.
A halter gratis, nothing else, for God’s sake.
God give your Grace good rest.
Can you do it?
Let go, slave, or thou diest!
Our fraughtage, sir, I have conveyed aboard, and I have bought The oil, the balsamum and aqua vitae.
Forever and forever farewell, Cassius.
Faith, sir, you need not fear.
Now will I to the chink, To spy an I can hear my Thisbe’s face.
Blessed pudding!
But where’s the money?
Romeo!— Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher?
Make no noise, make no noise.
I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation.
I will fetch him.
She said so.
But that you do not love me.
And I.
Sweet-heart!
You have seen nothing then?
And he’s gone.
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, And careful hours with time’s deformèd hand Have written strange defeatures in my face.
Their papers is more lawful.
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it.
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
Yet could I bear that too, well, very well.
It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius.
I do arrest you, sir.
The sun doth gild our armor.
Nay, he rubs himself with civet.
Lucius!—Fast asleep?
On, lusty gentlemen.
When came this to you?
God knows I loved my niece, And she is dead, slandered to death by villains That dare as well answer a man indeed As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.— Boys, apes, braggarts, jacks, milksops!
It is enacted in the laws of Venice, If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen, The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods.
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.
Nor I.
What friend?
Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
Come, let us to the banquet.
You must be father to your brother’s daughter, And give her to young Claudio.
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
I am bound to your niece, sir.
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
What a caterwauling do you keep here!
He dares not come there for the candle.
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host, And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Love wrought these miracles.
Say on, my loving lord.
It is a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself.
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
So Caesar may.
Weary sev'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle, peak and pine.
Who was ’t came by?
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord, And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
Bring me to Octavius.
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one night fourscore ducats.
Let me say “Amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew. 
There is no other way, Unless thou couldst put on some other shape And not be Richard, that hath done all this.
But stay awhile.
I say she shall.—And first begin with her.
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet.
There was none such in the army of any sort.
Ready, my lord.
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do, You are still crossing it.
Twenty crowns?
If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.
Why, thou say’st true.
Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
Out of doubt he is transported.
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she, as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king.
So young and so untender?
And I, my royal sovereign.
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
But who comes here?
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
A good soft pillow for that good white head Were better than a churlish turf of France.
Then murder’s out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh.
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles, And lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
And your reports have set the murder on.
Pray, have you not a daughter Called Katherina, fair and virtuous?
Twas a color he never liked.
Well roared, Lion!
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
I called thee then “vain flourish of my fortune.” I called thee then poor shadow, “painted queen,” The presentation of but what I was, The flattering index of a direful pageant, One heaved a-high, to be hurled down below, A mother only mocked with two fair babes, A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag To be the aim of every dangerous shot, A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble, A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Why, that was he.
So, with two seeming bodies but one heart, Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, Due but to one and crownèd with one crest.
O Clitus!
I embrace it.
Where is Duncan’s body?
Dead, dead?
Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble, And started when he looked upon the Tower, As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse.
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand.
Oh, that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today.
No, madam, he does nothing but smile.
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.
May you stead me?
Good Romeo, hide thyself.
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Do you confess the bond?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig, Some that are mad if they behold a cat, And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose, Cannot contain their urine.
Go to, say you nothing.
I with the morning’s love have oft made sport, And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red, Opening on Neptune with fair blessèd beams, Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
The venom clamors of a jealous woman Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.
Is this your speeding?
Why, Dromio?
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
Where is he?
I’ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
If they do see thee they will murder thee.
Wooed me to steal it, but she so loves the token (For he conjured her she should ever keep it) That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to.
Whose noise is this that ones on murder?
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Have all his ventures failed?
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
For as thou urgest justice, be assured Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest.
How many goodly creatures are there here!
Go to, carry this.
Is ’t frailty that thus errs?
I commend your pains, And every one shall share i' th' gains.
Thrice within this hour I saw him down, thrice up again and fighting.
Soft!
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you.
Now they believe it and withal whet me To be revenged on Rivers, Dorset, Grey; But then I sigh and, with a piece of scripture, Tell them that God bids us do good for evil; And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old ends stolen out of Holy Writ, And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state.
Why, so he doth, when he delivers you From this earth’s thralldom to the joys of heaven.
Let her send it.
Didst not mark that?
Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house.
Have you the lion’s part written?
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
A blank, my lord.
Let every eye nogetiate for itself And trust no agent, for beauty is a witch Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile—there art thou happy.
Therefore give me no counsel.
Bear them from hence.
She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
I will hear that play.
Masters, let him go.
She shall not.
Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both.
Pray you, away.
Look how our partner’s rapt.
Tis done by me, and ends in “Margaret.”   Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
Question: why, an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum.
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster.
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
True,” said she, “a fine little one.” “No,” said I, “a great wit.” “Right,” says she, “a great gross one.” “Nay,” said I, “a good wit.” “Just,” said she, “it hurts nobody.” “Nay,” said I, “the gentleman is wise.” “Certain,” said she, “a wise gentleman.” “Nay,” said I, “he hath the tongues.” “That I believe,” said she, “for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning; there’s a double tongue, there’s two tongues.” Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues.
There’s magic in the web of it.
Oh, no.
There is some strange thing toward, Edmund.
I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it.
I pray you call them in.
Macbeth!— Had I three ears, I’d hear thee.
I hear a knocking At the south entry.
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Tis much he dares, And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety.
This cannot anger him.
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.
Here’s Decius Brutus.
Poor souls, they perished.
How came you thus recovered?
Tomorrow, my lord.
If he do fear God, he must necessarily keep peace.
And a true lover of the holy Church.
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
Not i' th' stocks, fool.
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
Ay, and a kind one too.
Content.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it.
If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?
If there come truth from them— As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine— Why, by the verities on thee made good, May they not be my oracles as well, And set me up in hope?
A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains, Now useless, boiled within thy skull.—There stand, For you are spell-stopped.—   Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine, Fall fellowly drops.
My lord, I do protest—    O, do not swear!
Why, farewell, Portia.
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
Well, come again tomorrow.
The mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
I am here already, sir.
Had you not come upon your cue, my lord, William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part— I mean your voice for crowning of the king.
I am not made of stones, But penetrable to your kind entreaties, Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
The town sounds a parley.
Dolor comes to him, indeed.
Away!
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.
I know not if ’t be true, But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety.
Helen, it is not so.
I’ll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
Here comes Oberon.
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
What foul play had we that we came from thence?
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
I hear the minstrels play.
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou makest thy knife keen.
I remember the story.
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you.
I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
Thou speak’st aright.
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited.
Wilt thou have music?
Come on and kiss me, Kate.
I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath squandered abroad. 
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
When I like your favor, for God defend the lute should be like the case!
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
I would he knew that I had saved his brother.
When he returns from hunting, I will not speak with him.
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know.
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge.
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
We shall have a rare letter from him: but you’ll not deliver ’t?
Ay, but not rough enough.
I know she is an irksome brawling scold.
Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
sits.—I did never think that lady would have loved any man.
How I dote on thee!
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us?
Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt.
I have well approved it, sir.
The English force, so please you.
I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.
How fares my gracious sir?
Indeed he is not fit.
You should hear reason.
You might do much.
Is ’t possible?
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
Meantime, have patience.
Even now we housed him in the abbey here, And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.
If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She’ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
Appear and pertly!— No tongue.
Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.
I never shall endure her.
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse?
Ay, Casca.
What I should deny— As this I would, ay, though thou didst produce My very character—I’d turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damnèd practice.
Done.
Nay, we will slink away in supper time, Disguise us at my lodging, and return, All in an hour.
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate A contract of true love.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks.

How do you all at Verona?
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully.
Why?
Does he rave?
There’s none but witches do inhabit here, And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence.
I think it doth.
Into a thousand parts divide one man, And make imaginary puissance.
And that were enough to hang us all.
Now, beshrew my father’s ambition!
Come, go we to the king.
There is your money that I had to keep.
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
O monstrous world!
Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
Nay, send in time!
What is she?
What?
O life!
We’ll visit Caliban, my slave who never Yields us kind answer.
Why, he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds, With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn.—A century send forth.
What mean’st thou, that thou help’st me not?
Most detestable Death, by thee beguiled, By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown!
Thou shalt be pinched As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em.
I never saw the chain, so help me heaven, And this is false you burden me withal.
I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone tonight.
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
Thy false uncle— Dost thou attend me?
There are my keys.—But wherefore should I go?
Have mercy, Jesu!—Soft, I did but dream.
How old art thou?
The Duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, Even on the instant.
I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights.
What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancor—O God, that I were a man!
Where is she?
Made she no verbal question?
I grant him bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name.
But yet for all that, an if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly.
No, not a denier.
The best?
Has he, masters?
I pause for a reply.
Welcome, Iago.
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands.
There’s a bargain made.
I have not dined today.
Tis not to me she speaks.
Put up your sword.
Why, how now, Juliet?
They’ll mar my counterfeiting.
I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
Oh, she is Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed, And he’s composed of harshness.
Write to me very shortly, And you shall understand from me her mind.
His counsel now might do me golden service.
Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father?
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have showed some truth.
But sadly, tell me who.
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror, For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
Why, the night gone by.
Well, come, my Kate.
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.
Alack the day.
Ay, millstones, as he lessoned us to weep.
Tennis balls, my liege.
You have some cause; they have not.
Oh, are you come, Iago?
Should I not say, “Hath a dog money?
I speak in understanding.
Ratcliffe, come hither.
Captain, I thee beseech to do me favors.
I will be mild and gentle in my words.
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!
He hath slept long.
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge.
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.
He was wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his bond.
Freedom!
Pray, chuck, come hither.
Will you pleasure me?
How many, as you guess?
At once, good night.
My lord, good morrow.
Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
I doubt not that, since we are well-persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours, Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us.
What do you mean?
I have stayed for thee, God knows, in torment and in agony.
For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance.
Alas, poor caitiff!
Come, wherefore should you be so pashful?
Most veritable, therefore look to ’t well.
Let him not pass, But kill him rather.
Where be thy brothers?
A plague upon this howling!
Why so, being gone,      Why so, being gone, I am a man again.
Thus I’ll visit her.
Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil.
Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.
Nor I, my lord.
Shut up your doors, my lord.
Poor lady, she’ll run mad When she shall lack it.
Where hast thou been, sister?
Remember what I have said.
Make no delay.
But soft!
Else the Puck a liar call.
I crave the law, The penalty, and forfeit of my bond.
Ay, so please your Majesty.
Do not lie so near.
Tis certain.
Look, when I vow, I weep.
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.
By this hand, I am.
O God, she comes.—O honey Nurse, what news?
I say to you this house is dark.
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
A friend.
What, Nurse, I say!
What, art thou waking?
My sight was ever thick.
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in.
There is means, madam.
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
And you too, sir.
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear A stranger to thy thoughts.
To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back.
My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
You must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him.
Expound unto me, boy.
I warrant you, sir, The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver.
God grant we never may have need of you.
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?
He’s safe for these three hours.
Now sir, this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does?
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
What would my lord?
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Zounds, sir, you’re robbed!
Will you go hunt, my lord?
Let him answer me.— Come, follow me, boy.
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings—” Thy yellow stockings?
There is a lord will hear you play tonight; But I am doubtful of your modesties, Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior— For yet his Honor never heard a play— You break into some merry passion And so offend him.
I will be flesh and blood, For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance.
O, let me speak!
But who was this?
What is it she does now?
Hide it in smiles and affability.
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.
Thou know’st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, And wit depends on dilatory time.
If th' other two be brained like us, the state totters.
I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men.
We’ll answer.
You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid.
Amen.
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio and my master, planted and placed and possessed by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
You, uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull’st off'rings have breathed out That e'er devotion tendered—what shall I do?
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you.
O mischief strangely thwarting!
I fear me both are false.
The concavities of it is not sufficient, for, look you, th' athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look you, is digt himself four yard under the countermines.
Three or four wenches where I stood cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts.
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her, And bring them after in the best advantage.
No?
She should have died hereafter.
Or docks, or mallows.
Two things are to be done: My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.
Who can arraign me for ’t?
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
O time’s extremity, Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.
This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
I shall be reconciled to him again.
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
There’s five to one.
O my daughter, Fled with a Christian!
My tale provokes that question.
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
How now?
Madam, I am here.
What is his name?
We will, my noble lord.
God will revenge it.
Here, here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids.
Pray heaven it be State matters, as you think, and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you.
If he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit.
Your reason?
My lord?
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
Inquire the Jew’s house out.
Three and three, We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.
Edmund and I have talked, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s.
Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of her love?
We’ll burn the house of Brutus.
White-livered runagate, what doth he there?
I would fain learn to lie.
The images of revolt and flying off.
Therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English.
I’ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria.
Tell me your counsels.
Tis from your sister.
No, and swears she never will.
We’ll be friends first.
The dew is raw and cold.
Music such as charmeth sleep!
Yet that is but a crushed necessity, Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
Shall we not, Sir Andrew?
And, friends, disperse yourselves.
O sinful thought!
Well, in that hit you miss.
Nay, when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted.
Sweet friends, to bed.
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
A man is master of his liberty; Time is their master, and when they see time They’ll go or come.
There will we dine.
My brother and thy uncle, called Antonio— I pray thee, mark me (that a brother should Be so perfidious!
Who would be jealous, then, of such a one?
Your will?
An they will take it, so.
I can be patient.
Sir, you speak nobly.
I will deserve your pains.
Who will go with me?
Home, you idle creatures get you home!
And Caesar shall go forth.
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man, Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursèd self.
Nor will not.
Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me?
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
Well.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.
And I, delivering you, am satisfied, And therein do account myself well paid.
If I do not put on a sober habit, Talk with respect and swear but now and then, Wear prayer books in my pocket, look demurely— Nay more.
O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile, And teach me how to curse mine enemies.
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
Tell me for more certainty, Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.
I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.
Tis the time’s plague when madmen lead the blind.
Draw, you rogue, or I’ll so carbonado your shanks.
If so, be patient, sister.
Is he not honest?
Thou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee.
Masters, never speak, we charge you, let us obey you go with us.
O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name!
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant?
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.
Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.
Be your tears wet?
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action, yet prodigious grown, And fearful as these strange eruptions are.
What we will do, we do upon command.
Let’s call more help To have them bound again.
I am a gentleman.
That way the noise is.
Up, my lords.
Scurvy knave!
I must obey.
Thy truth then be thy dower.
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
Let your epilogue alone.
Consent to pay thee that I never had?— Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.
Whither away?
Ay, you did wish that I would make her turn.
Who calls?
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold (though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before ’tis ripe) what thou dost know Hath newly passed between this youth and me.
Come one more.
The thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards, And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am evened with him, wife for wife.
Make it no wonder.
Well, sir, I will.
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
Good my friends, consider You are my guests.
I doubt not of his temperance.
Brother Anthony—
My dagger, little cousin?
What will you do with ’t, that you have been so earnest To have me filch it?
He’s as tall a man as any ’s in Illyria.
This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way Is to avoid the aim.
Thy asses are gone about 'em.
Ha, ha, ha!
We are spoiled and yonder he is!
Hence.
The sun will not be seen today.
Come hither, man.
O, full of danger is the duke of Gloucester, And the queen’s sons and brothers haught and proud, And were they to be ruled, and not to rule, This sickly land might solace as before.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.—Lord, Lord!
Where is Antony?
I must be circumstanced.
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth.
Do not say “banishment.” Hence from Verona art thou banishèd.
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
So out went the candle and we were left darkling.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
Good night, my lord.
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
What man art thou that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered thus.
Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.
Come, boy.
Where is your husband?
Sebastian are you?
I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.
Well aimed of such a young one.
True.
Here is more news.
Tell me but this, Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night.
Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.
Great business must be wrought ere noon.
Who is here so vile that will not love his country?
He’s fortified against any denial. 
Twas where you wooed the gentlewoman so well.
No more of that.
They must lie there.
No more of that.
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him.
I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
His bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, Stand in bold cure.
Put them to motion.
Not I.
He brushes his hat o' mornings.
It was not brought me, my lord.
Do you know me, sir?
Tis heavy night, These may be counterfeits.
And so it is, truly, and very notably discharged.
In nothing am I changed But in my garments.
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,  Weary of all, shall want some.
Do not believe That, from the sense of all civility, I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.
So please you.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.
Servant-monster”?
Yea,” quoth my husband, “Fall’st upon thy face?
You are very welcome, sir.
These are the forgeries of jealousy.
I am not furnished with the present money.
Ratcliffe, about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me.
Yes, Cassius.
What noise is that?
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them.
No, Messala.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires, Men so disordered, so debauched and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn.
As love is, my lord, before it loves.
Where is my mother?
So the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
When I am alone, why then I am Tranio; But in all places else, your master Lucentio.
His grace speaks cheerfully.
Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy.
Ay, sir, for three months.
But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again.
Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
Caesar!
My mistress, sir,” quoth I.
Mine eyes do itch, Doth that bode weeping?
Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting. 
Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!
But as I think—for truly would I speak, And now do I bethink me, so it is— I came with Hermia hither.
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath?
All lost!
Such a one Am I to fear, or none.
Com’st thou again for ransom?
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
Alas, what is the matter?
Lend me thy handkerchief.
The King will be gone from Southampton.
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse Abides in me.
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
Hence his ambition growing— Dost thou hear?
By thee; and this thou didst return from him: That he did buffet thee and, in his blows, Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
In some bush?
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, Pisa renownèd for grave citizens.
The minute of their plot Is almost come.—Well done.
What is Pyramus?
Is he gone and hath nothing?
How think you of it?
Yet, forgive me, God, That I do brag thus.
What is thy will with her?
What serious contemplation are you in?
I do require them of you, so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine.
Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.
Tis true, this god did shake!
He has no children.
Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
I gave you all— And in good time you gave it.
What offense, sweet Beatrice?
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Who can blot that name With any just reproach?
You’ll be sick tomorrow For this night’s watching.
All things are ready if our minds be so.
We wait upon your Grace.
I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noon-day upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking.
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Perhaps you have learned it without book.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
What is ’t?
Romeo!
Marry, patience, Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, And nothing of a man.
Warrant thee, my man’s as true as steel.
Jailer, look to him.
O Caesar!
Look you for any other issue?
Thyself shalt see the act.
My lord?  
What shall I do?
It is not seen enough; you should wear it in your cap.
I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
Thou shalt serve me.
The princess is the better Englishwoman.—I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding.
When shall we three meet again?
Pray God it be, sir.
Here comes another of the tribe.
I know not what ’twas but distraction.
A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
And pity to the general wrong of Rome— As fire drives out fire, so pity pity— Hath done this deed on Caesar.
No words can that woe sound.
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.
And those that leave their valiant bones in France, Dying like men though buried in your dunghills, They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honors reeking up to heaven, Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
He misses not much.
Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.
I must needs report the truth.
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?
Is it so nominated in the bond?
Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
If I dream not, thou art Emilia.
You!
Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son, A man well known throughout all Italy.
Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message bluntly.
I strike quickly, being moved.
Thursday is near.
I do remember me, Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king, When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
Fair sir, and you, my merry mistress, That with your strange encounter much amazed me, My name is called Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa, And bound I am to Padua, there to visit A son of mine which long I have not seen.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds, Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
Is not this true?
Then must the Jew be merciful.
I am your host.
And here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
What should I do with him?
Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him.
It is not day.
You’re welcome, sir, and he for your good sake.
I’ll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
The noise they make Will cause Demetrius to awake.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers!
You have little cause to say so.
What news, what news in this our tott'ring state?
Thou didst promise To bate me a full year.
Is it new and old too?
You are their heir, you sit upon their throne, The blood and courage that renownèd them Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege Is in the very May-morn of his youth, Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him.
What’s the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler?
And therefore ’tis called a sensible tale.
Hoyday, a riddle!
Tis partly my own fault, Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together.
Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born.
Dost thou prate, rogue?
The Dauphin longs for morning.
He’s in Arthur’s bosom, if ever man went to Arthur’s bosom.
I will verify as much in his beard.
She’s dead, deceased, she’s dead.
Upon the crown o' th' cliff, what thing was that Which parted from you?
Love’s not love When it is mingled with regards that stands Aloof from th' entire point.
None but the fool, who labors to outjest His heart-struck injuries.
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
It is no shame.
The man grows mad.
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
Be large in mirth.
Do not bid me speak.
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
What says Romeo?
Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.
And what say’st thou then to my love?
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought, Perplexed in the extreme.
He hath made me a Christian.
This savors not much of distraction.
You look as you had something more to say.
To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
Shall I be plain?
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter.
Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony.
Thou say’st the king grows mad.
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.
Ay.
I am their father’s mother.
You are a fool.
What is your parentage?” “Above my fortunes, yet my state is well.
Prepare you, generals.
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, “An you will not have me, choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not.
Tarry a little.
If not, I’ll die your maid.
Give me thy hand.
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Tis time to look about.
Most rightful judge!
I guess at it.
Hast thou the flower there?
Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, Whither away, or where is thy abode?
As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
Did not you speak?
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
I cannot say “whore,” It does abhor me now I speak the word.
Where?
There’s a division betwixt the dukes.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear, For beasts that meet me run away for fear.
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away!
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
Ay, my good lord.
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
I swear I’ll cuff you if you strike again.
You told me so.
Tis pity of him.
Didst thou not kill this king?
Tis so; and that self chain about his neck Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
What, would you make me mad?
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
Tell the clock there.
You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion.
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
If any, speak—for him have I offended.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
Am I your man?
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.
Save you, friend Cassio!
Ambassadors from Harry King of England Do crave admittance to your Majesty.
Make a short shrift.
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies That keep her from her rest.
But all this did I know before.
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
Saint Francis be my speed!
Not tonight, good Iago.
You’ll have your nephews neigh to you.
If so, then be not tongue-tied.
Well met, Corporal Nym.
O hated potion, hence!
Small joy have I in being England’s queen.
I must hence to wait.
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength.
My lord, I shall reply amazèdly, Half sleep, half waking.
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
For two, and sound ones too.
Let us not break with him, For he will never follow anything That other men begin.
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.
What should I think on ’t?
I would I could see this taborer.
Myself?
But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony.
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
He is arrived.
It is, my lord.
Both which, Master Constable— You have.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
I stand dishonored, that have gone about To link my dear friend to a common stale.
When saw you my father last?
What news?
Both?
Good night, good brother.
O God!
Ay, forsooth.
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master, Stocking his messenger.
Where is my page?—Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
That’s fouler.
Wrong I mine enemies?
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.
I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love. 
A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law.
Yea, the same.
My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of it.
By my troth, I am sick.
How now, Cassio!
This it is: 'Tis better that the enemy seek us.
No, by my life and soul!
Now art thou Romeo.
Go, keep us company, And we shall make full satisfaction.— Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail Of you, my sons, and till this present hour My heavy burden ne'er deliverèd.— The Duke, my husband, and my children both, And you, the calendars of their nativity, Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
See this dispatched with all the haste thou canst: Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.
What hath quenched them hath given me fire.
I’ll not be strucken, my lord.
If you do stir abroad, go armed.
I pity you.
Speak within door.
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
Thou villain, what sayest thou?
She is not well.
Did not her kitchen maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think.
Here, wear this jewel for me.
Have I, Malvolio?
If you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.
My lord, the enemy is past the marsh.
My master calls me.
She is protectress of her honor too.
Is all the counsel that we two have shared, The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty-footed time For parting us—oh, is it all forgot?
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
Yes, being kept together and put to use.
I am an ass; else it could never be But I should know her as well as she knows me.
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o'er myself.
It is not so expressed, but what of that?
I leave an arrant knave with your Worship, which I beseech your Worship to correct yourself, for the example of others.
How does my bounteous sister?
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too.
Then never man was man true.
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embarked to cross to Burgundy, And in my company my brother Gloucester, Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches.
Go then, my mother; to thy daughter go.
Let that suffice you.
Be merciful, great duke, to men of mold.
They have not been commanded, mighty king.
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound.
Tis very much.
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.
Tis a naughty night to swim in.
Yet say I, he is in love.
I am sure I am none such.
He is a sick man that would speak with you.
In this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain.
But new struck nine.
Ay, so I think.
Richard!
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
What, not a whore?
The Moor already changes with my poison.
Masters, masters—   warrant you.
No, alas, I found it And I did give ’t my husband.
O, never Shall sun that morrow see!
Go, call him hither, boy   No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels Hath he so long held out with me, untired, And stops he now for breath?
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—Masters, do you serve God?
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is.
Now have I done a good day’s work.
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
Who’s that which rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules, And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find, Many for many virtues excellent, None but for some and yet all different.
And when please you to say so?
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret.
Came they not by you?
See how yon justice rails upon yon simple thief.
I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me.
Ay, my lord, an ’t please you.
Art thou contented, Jew?
If you deny them, all the land will rue it.
I do but keep the peace.
I stand on sudden haste.
If not, he’s plain.
Woe, alas!
God bless your Grace!
Am I your bird?
I’ll be at charges for a looking glass And entertain a score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body.
They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers, which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine, for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs.
Tis late.
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither For stale to catch these thieves.
How is it with her?
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, Who, having some advantage on Octavius, Took it too eagerly.
As ignorant as dirt!
You know not how to choose a man.
I am sure you know him well enough.
I cannot blame her.
Thou know’st where I will tarry.
I am bound to thee forever.
Wipe thine eyes.
Win me and wear me!
My lord.
Oh, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
A friend of Antony’s.
Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
See, your wife’s with him.
But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge Cry “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”
Who dead?
It is too hard a knot for me to untie!
I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
It is, my lord.
Saving your merry humor, here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion, Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman.
Oh, thereby hangs a tail.
Be it so.
If without peril it be possible, Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him, And give him from me this most needful note.
Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bondslave?
God keep me from false friends, but they were none.
That’s as we list to grace him.
So humbly take my leave.
I have it not about me.
Some to the common pulpits, and cry out, “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!” People and senators, be not affrighted.
It would become me As well as it does you, and I should do it With much more ease, for my good will is to it And yours it is against.
Prithee, put up.
O me, my heart, my rising heart!
A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
I am very glad to see you, signior.
Art thou aught else but place, degree, and form, Creating awe and fear in other men, Wherein thou art less happy, being feared, Than they in fearing?
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
And so had mine.
You would be satisfied?
O cruel!
I may not leave it so.
He was a bachelor then.
Here is the place, my lord.
Who comes with him?
It is a creature That dotes on Cassio, as ’tis the strumpet’s plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one.
Let us be jocund.
So please you— What says the fellow there?
He will bear you easily and reins well.
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail.
This is some priory.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.— My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
Nay, good goose, bite not.
And this.
Content with Hermia?
Ay, that’s the way.
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb.
Go armed.
Lady, you know no rules of charity, Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
One word more.
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman.
Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.
Lay forth the gown.
Room for Antony, most noble Antony!
Thus the bowl should run, And not unluckily against the bias.
Send for the county.
Statilius showed the torchlight but, my lord, He came not back.
Play the men.
Dost thou call me fool, boy?
Good morrow, both.
Mars’s hot minion is returned again.
Is this the Prince?
