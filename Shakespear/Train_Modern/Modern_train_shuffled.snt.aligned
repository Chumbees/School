Imagine, me, a drunk!
Your Majesty, see here—if it won’t offend your Grace—what a complete, rascally, beggarly, lousy rat this is.
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive?
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge.
But it is his handwriting?
I promise I will.
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
For my part, I really don’t care.
Look, here comes a walking fire.
I’ll wake him, because that’s my job.
Yes, I am.
I’m sorry about what happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all right.
You are welcome here, my friends.
It’s noble Kent, your friend.
I won’t keep you very long.
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed.
You know why I think so?
I don’t like his face.
There’s justice in heaven after all!
That’s me.
That really is an illegitimate hope.
It’s true she looked at me a lot, in fact, she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted, and couldn’t really finish her sentences very well.
That only proves how inexperienced you are.
May God’s blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good, and enemies into friends!
I’m being called.
It’s true, my lord.
Follow it, follow it!
But tell me honestly, are you sure you’re not insane?
She will have a seat—you heard my daughter tell you how.
Keep up your courage, man!
Is this servant of yours a smart man?
My friend, your husband, the honest, honest Iago.
My lord, you know I’m your friend.
Be good enough to hear me out.
To bed!
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed, for my horse is my mistress.
Yes, sir, but not when I’m enraged.
He can sniff his way to Dover.
How are you?
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying?
Or stuff what he says into their pockets.
Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
If not, leave me alone, and I’ll stay away from your turf.
No, I must let them find me.
Good morning, Brutus.
And when is he leaving?
My love, call him back in here.
I’ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven, praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year.
There was a noise, that’s certainly true.
Welcome, my friends.
Draw the curtains, just like that.
And you’ve come at a good time, so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won’t come today.
You mock an ancient tradition, born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died, and then have the gall not to stand by your words.
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately.
I’ll help you, Sir Toby.
Oh, my mistress, a villain has made a mockery of your love!
Learn to see better, Lear, and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice.
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth, no more or less.
It was just an accident!
With a hand like this you need to
Where are you all off to?
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes?
Come on, take us to him.
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity.
Demetrius doesn’t think so, and that’s all that matters.
Now, Roderigo, where did you see her?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you saw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a father?—How did you know it was her?—To think she tricked me so easily!—What did she say to you?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives.
What miracle will he work next?
In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your mother.
I slept well, ate well, and was happy.
Labio and Flavio, push our armies onward.
Again!
Okay, just do this, noble Catesby: sound out Lord Hastings, but make it seem as if you’re just mulling over the idea, that it hasn’t been firmed up yet.
No, madam.
You’re a man with a good reputation.
I’m not such an idiot that I can’t keep my hands dry.
Well, is it not news that Petruchio’s coming?
It’s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men.
Oh, please do.
The owl made noise all night.
As for this slave, Iago, if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time, he’ll have it.
Here comes Kent.
If you mutiny against me, I’ll hang you from the next tree.
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life?
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation.
Tell me, who had him arrested?
The advancement of your children, noble lady.
I’m the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates.
Did you have to give them everything?
Can you tell me?
Drown yourself?
It’s the same with men.
I wouldn’t either, by daylight.
That’s impossible.
They are full of pity for Caesar.
I wouldn’t even pee without dancing a waltz.
My dear lady— Please let me say something, I’m begging you.
Or was it a blessing that we came here?
Let it go up to heaven.
But your words are as sweet as honey—you’ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing.
I’m afraid you’ll come to me again for ransom.
Mark Antony, take Caesar’s body.
I’ll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining.
I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones.
Death and damnation!
Why, dear me, Kate!
Are you?
Until then, I’ll walk around town, peruse the markets, and gaze upon the buildings, and then I’ll return and sleep at the inn.
Ever since the Duke’s messenger visited Olivia, she’s been upset.
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself?
Who could have restrained himself, who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it?
Here comes the owner of one piece.
I’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now, if it’s okay that I’m picking up what others have thrown away.
We’ll give you an answer tomorrow.
On a night like this!
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love.
They only like things as bad as themselves.
Are you going to get me in trouble?
That’s the one, sir.
Let me see it.
It’s a long story—and tough to listen to.
Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and you’ll be embarrassed.
Farewell.
But who are you?
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today.
I owe you a lot, and like a spoiled kid I’ve lost what I owe you.
You abused me to my face.
Let’s go back to our bedroom.
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money?
Oh, not you again.
So go in peace.
No doubt, no doubt.
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo.
Launcelot, what’s going on?
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest.
Take a little vacation in Mantua.
Am I sorry that I only had one child?
She shall, Lucentio.
No, indeed, my lord.
I ask for him, and he comes.
Be patient with him, Brutus.
Kiss him for that, good widow.
Please do, madam.
Who heard me do that?
Give me some applause, if we’re friends, and Robin will make everything up to you.
I’m here.
It’s my daughter!
Look: Benedick is so pale—are you sick, or angry?
Will you be patient?
It doesn’t need to be witty as long as it’s eloquent and imaginative.
If you have poison for me, I’ll drink it.
If he doesn’t like it, he can go live with my sister.
Go ahead.
I had business that made me late.
You said it when you were furious.
Tonight I’ll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting—as if they came from several citizens—all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus, and all alluding to Caesar’s unseemly ambition.
Here comes my wife now.
Go after him and try to calm him down a little.
I know what I’ll do.
No, first let’s talk to him.
It’s like a cannon.
Be brave like the lion and proud.
What a silly monster, to think a poor drunk is wonderful.
So is Lysander.
Are you always going to be like this?
To that end, I presented him with the tennis balls, the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity.
We’re talking here in a public place.
Oh, my liege, my wife died tonight.
I always pray for them 
Tell him I’ll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy’s Day and slap his head with it.
You told me they escaped into this forest.
What about it?
They can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true.
I swear by this hand and my father’s soul, the whole thing is a disaster.
What, are you dead, my dove?
You purple flower, hit by Cupid’s arrow, sink into the pupils of this man’s eyes.
I’ve spelled it out for you clearly.
Not in my house, Lucentio.
I’m not Lear.
But truly, if I were as 
It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to do.
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me, who cut her sweet prince’s life short and made her a widow?
I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn.
You’ll wear a mask, and you can make your voice as high as you want to.
No more than I do yours.
An excellent motion.
He sleeps all day like a cat.
Yes, I’m sure he’s dead.
I’d like you to, see, because you don’t like it, and because it isn’t to your taste, and because it doesn’t agree with you.
Yes, ma'am.
But sir, there is no such house, no such maid, and no such men as you have dreamed up, like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece, a Peter Turph, one “Henry Pimpernell,” and twenty more men of this sort—who never actually existed.
Lady, come out of the tomb.
That fair-skinned, hard-hearted hussy, Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane.
You look angry.
And you haven’t heard any news about her in your letters?
Oh, holy Friar, Oh, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady’s husband?
Keep an eye on her.
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
Are you really alive, Stephano?
He is taking care of it as we speak.
Her reputation was as pure as the snow, but now it’s as dirty and black as my own face.
Is he in his royal garments?
All this fighting is because of you.
Is it lost?
Has she already forgotten her brave husband, Prince Edward, whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger?
Two thousand ducats a year from his land! 
First of all, my house in the city, as you know, is filled with expensive furniture and household articles, china and gold, basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in.
His name is Tyrrel, my lord.
How are you, my pretty Bianca?
Young Prince Edward is still alive—what do you think I’m going to say next?
That’s noble of you, master.
Wait, countrymen.
I wish none of this had happened, given the situation here, and your rank.
So listen up, princess.
Trinculo, speak politely.
I’ve told you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick by you. 
Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined.
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home?
No rescue for me?
Well, I wish you liked me.
Let us prepare for our wedding.—On that day, I’ll take your oath of loyalty, my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers, to guarantee my treaty.
No problem, madam.
Give me that letter, sir.
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you.
No, madam.
But he’s young, and as long as he’s too young to become king, Richard, the duke of Gloucester, has power over him.
Stop right now or I’ll throw your dagger over the roof.
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves, or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men?
I think he’s nervous—he’s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated.
I’ll be right next to you.
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it.
Why are you whipping that whore?
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up, on strict orders from him.
Didn’t I turn down the page where I left off reading?
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a trouble just the same.
Whatever else happens tonight, I hope the king escapes safely!
That sound you heard was the  It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.
Take him away.
Oh, Regan, she’s torn me apart with unkindness, like a vulture, right here. 
You do Stay, Please, tell me what you think of me.
I got it from you—I never said I didn’t.
In my bedroom window there is a book.
As we were trading blows, more and more people showed up to join the fight, until the Prince came and broke everyone up.
I’ll either fight you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused.
Ah, it’s a sensitive animal, with a good conscience.
I will mourn Hero tonight.  
Go find him, please, and bring him to my tent.
Be quiet, for shame!
So shut up!
Dear lady, welcome home.
He deserves only honor, complete honor.
And didn’t I finally arrive to comfort you?
Go ahead.
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects.
Then hurry up and tell me what you want.
Well, this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women.
No man must know.” What comes after that?
Tell us when you wish to get married, and may God give you joy.
So I thank you all, and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone.
Stop crying.
No, I’ll walk right next to you, side by side.
Did you see anything?
Be quick about it.
He’s gone, and his wife’s dead.
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty.
And shall our lively blood, quickened by wine, be so frosty?
I told him you were sick.
She’s cheating on me?
We’re available.
What do you say?
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so.  
They don’t want you to go out today.
There’s nothing more.
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub.
My Cesario?
Let’s go!
Tell me truthfully, do you love my sister?
Before I saw Lysander, Athens seemed like paradise to me.
Worse than that, she’s polluted herself, so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce!
Even if it’s not better, your first marriage is over.
To hell with this idiot!
Gratiano!
Are you there?
Your clothes aren’t spattered with my family’s blood, and you aren’t affected by my curse.
I don’t think so.
Oh, Antonio, I’m sorry I caused you so much trouble.
And has my armor been put in my tent?
Why, she’s inside.
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day.
Yes, I am.
From soldiers.
Get away from here and leave me.
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta, when you know that I know about your love for Theseus?
He has epilepsy, a disease where you fall down.
Keep your promise, my love.
I met him in the street—he was there with that man.
I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second meeting.
And what will you do if it returns to you?
It was tossed into the window of my room.
Just as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs.
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us.
You probably killed a lot of his men?
Regan gives good advice.
If he’s angry, there must be something seriously wrong.
Who sent you this time?
No, keep going, old man; don’t stop like that.
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first, so let me drop.
And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us, so you won’t die as humans do.—Come here, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!
We’ll mutiny.
Lord, Lord, she’ll be a happy woman.
My niece Olivia will notice, and let me tell you, no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage.
We know you have a job to do, Brakenbury, and we’ll do what you say.
I’m happy about that.
The queen is here on special business, and her army has moved on.
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth, the true heirs of each royal house, be joined together!
It’s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I’d cheated on you with the Moor.
Oh, ceremony, only show me your value!
Tyranny is dead!
He can’t possibly be such a monster— And I’m sure he isn’t.
That’s right, except for the widow Dido.
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes.
I swear on my soul it was a lie.
So submit to my mercy or, like men who revel in their own destruction, challenge me to do my worst.
Officers, what crime have these men committed?
Because, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
But look, Cassius, Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they’ve been scolded.
My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price: death.
Do you love me?
Oh, they say that dress surpasses all others.
If they seek battle with us, have them come down or else clear the field.
I mean when I wore it at your daughter’s wedding.
If only that were all it is— It is, I promise.
At five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it.
Your father was an extremely moral man, and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds.
Why are you whispering?
Still the same old Cassius!
Go play with yourself.
To save her life, I’ll say she doesn’t.
I’ve brought him a present.
What’s the matter?
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did, give me my advice back again.
At Friar Lawrence’s cell she can make confession and be married.
The second cock crowed.
I meant they had to give her credit.
Then you were right on target.
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow, and this is the first time he’s done it?
Goodbye, my husband.
Please, my lord, call her back.
Fast!
Keep going, keep going, or I’ll declare myself the winner.
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too.
For God’s sake, my lord, let’s be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince.
But tell me, are you speaking seriously?
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses, his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we’ve shed, and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with.
Richard loves Richard, that is, there’s just me and myself here.
So give me my nightgown, Emilia, and I’ll say goodnight.
I’m in a mood to beat you up pretty good.
Who I am and what I want are a secret.
I’ll go ahead of you, sir. 
Nurse!
The king’s a dear boy with a heart of gold, he’s a lively lad, a wag, born of fine parents, good with his fists.
I’ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master’s.
What will be my evidence?
Never apologize—when the actors are all dead, no one can be blamed.
They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans.
They’re all ready to eat dinner.
Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me.
Don’t do it with poison.
Anything.
Who are you?
Either my eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.
Well, that doesn’t worry me.
Well, sir, I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while.
Look at you, thrashing about like a blind man.
Lead’s too crass to hold her.
You liar, you respond better to the whip than to kindness!
Feeling the loss like this, I can’t help but weep for him forever.
I bet it’s a love letter!  
Their messengers are ready, waiting to deliver our response in these matters.
I’ll knock your teeth out, sir.
Bad friends were.
We’re ruined!
If he loves Caesar, then he can only hurt himself—by grieving and dying for Caesar.
What’s that, you runt?
That’s the weakness I’ll use to get revenge on him.
What a fool I’ve been!
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them, like a slow-acting poison.
She’s full of good intentions.
I’m off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding.
And, if you need to, approach the subject of me: tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward, my noble father was fighting in France.
I’ll tell twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago.
If you want to watch, follow me.
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s good for you.
If that’s true, which it is, she might as well be in love with a dream, the poor lady.
Good Volumnius, you know that we went to school together.
Oh, how brave of you!
Don’t you suspect my office?
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before?
No, great king.
I’ll give you a greater gift than that, nephew.
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
I’m not holding your hand, sir.
He’s more of a soldier than a wise man.  
I just want everything to be all right between you.
Let’s go!
I’m telling you, get out of here, and don’t follow me around like this.
Who did this to him?
Whoosh!
Oh, dear!
Come, Vaughan.
She says all the right things, but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story.
Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions.
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us.
What does he look like, Biondello?
Maybe it’s an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes.
And who is that?
He’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans.
Oh Stephano, do you have any more of that wine?
Oh, he’s like a snake disguised as a flower.
Yes, and Wall too.
I swear I do.
So find someone younger to love, or you won’t be able to maintain your feelings.
Goodbye.
That’s you, right?
Well, get out of here then!
We know each other’s faces, but as for our thoughts, he doesn’t know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his—or you do about mine.
Stay where you are.
If there were anything inside their heads, they could never wear such heavy helmets.
I’m going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol.
Give me some light!
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail, but I don’t think he brought it to you.
I’ll kill him!
What’s that music?
I sent the king’s son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island, where he’s sitting now sighing, with his arms crossed like this.
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues.
We’re two lions born on the same day in the same litter, and I’m the older and more terrible.
Look, it’s my dear Lady Disdain!
Let me unbutton this.
Let me just ask her one question, and by your authority as her father, order her to answer truthfully.
Why are you calling me “love”?
His daughters want to kill him.
He was my brother’s son!
You have to be patient, madam.
But you should hurry anyway.
He wants the child for himself, to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests.
But who is this?
My brother is imprisoned because of you, I am disgraced, and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren’t worth a dime have suddenly been promoted.
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own.
I don’t completely distrust you.
The two of us will guard you while you sleep, my lord, and keep you safe.
My daughter is still very young.
Come on, get ready.
Or was I dreaming?
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
Oh, will it never be day?
Now let me tell you, Casca, I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission.
Every night I’m awakened by his  Poor dear, goodbye.
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife.
Do you dare kill a friend of mine?
Oh that great, funny guy, Bottom!
If you’re as poor a subject as he is a king, you definitely are poor.
My dearest relative, I’m begging you, pull yourself together.
Are you begging, brother?
Take my advice.
It’s not safe to be straightforward and honest.
You’re going to make me jealous, Launcelot, if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this!
That’s not the tune I had in mind.
Let quick sulfurous lightning, strong enough to split enormous trees, singe the white hair on my head.
Yes, that’s the idea.
If you like, we’ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need.
But you’re too good a friend for me to wish her on you.
Well then, leave them alone until they’re sober.
I’m Christopher Sly.
I second that 
The table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart.
Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her.
The handkerchief!
He asks her to do what God  Say she will be a high and mighty queen.
My cousin Westmoreland?
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool!
I’m your neighbor and came courting first.
I plan to fall into the blackest despair.
My food, my fortune, my sweetest hope, my heaven on earth, and my entrance to heaven.
Why do you come here?
But who is this person, sir?
The life”?
If I’m not mistaken, that’s Portia’s voice.
Goodbye.
In England this strange monster would be just like a man.
Your  I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood.
He constantly offends me.
And no one eat any onions or garlic.
At least I’ve got some booze to comfort me.
It’s true.
We’ve been praying for our husbands' welfare.
She weeps for Edward and so do I, while she does not weep for Clarence, though I do.
Don’t be afraid.
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with.
What a long night this is!
You will.
Jesus, he’s an ass if there ever was one!
Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts.
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice.
It’s not manly to cry.
How?
The court awards it and the law authorizes it.
I want my sword.
I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet.
It’s not earlier than that, I tell you.
But aren’t you drowned, Stephano?
It hangs like an old worn-out mop.
He did, and he snatched my ring right off my finger.
Yes, and be brief.
You think my uncle was lying, grandmother?
This is his second fit like this.
Consider it done, my lord.
Don Pedro is here.
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety.
I wish I had a fault like that!
I have forgotten why I called you back.
No, and I didn’t hear anything either, or suspect anything at all.
Her father loves you, Demetrius.
I’m off to visit my friends in Padua—particularly my best friend Hortensio.
Are my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
Someone who can ride fast, go to the duke of  Here, my good lord.
Don’t say anything else.
But did your sister die of love?
This man is probably like that.
How are you, my love?—Demetrius and Egeus, come with us.
Kind and dear princess!
Twelve years ago, Miranda, twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan, a powerful prince.
The Lord Mayor is knocking.
He doesn’t have any daughters, sir.
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now.—Say goodbye to them, Cordelia, even though they’ve been unkind to you.
Shall Kate be my wife?
Killing pigs.
If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend.
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by, and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody.
Honest Iago’s arranged that.
What’s that paper you were reading?
If only I could spit poison.
I know how his mind works.
Who’s the one who’s going out the door right now?
Think about the ones who have died.
Or did you agree to this as equals?
So will we all.
If he breaks the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
In our case, our bad neighbors over their make us early risers, a healthy and sensible thing to be.
No.
Let’s follow the old earl, and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go.
Grant their law-abiding request!
What’s going on?
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover.
In order to find a mother and a brother, I too have lost myself, unhappily.
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels?
Your name’s Gloucester.
What if your husband strays elsewhere?
I wish we were safely on board our ship already.
When I left him, he was less than nine miles from here.
Yes, as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint.
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven.
He’s called Modo and Mahu.
If I’m a wasp, look out for my stinger.
Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing.
What’s happening now, Lucillius?
Is he angry?
Yes, that was it.
Oh, you wicked scoundrel!
I wish I were something better, because right now I’m a big fool.
Are you biting your thumb at us?
But I can’t help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said, “Yes.” I swear, she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster’s testicle.
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns, like wave crests in a storm at sea.
Goodbye.
So I  Your Honor’s actors, hearing of your recovery, have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you—and your doctors approve wholeheartedly.
Be patient, because you’re staying with me.
I didn’t.
Upon my life, my lord, I’ll do it.
Listen to that Petruchio: she says she’ll see you hanged first.
I could have sworn he trampled on me.
Tell me what a drunk is like, fool.
Come, put it over my face. 
Then take this man into your service, Octavius, for he did the final service to my master.
Are you riding far?
I’d rather be anything besides a fool.
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
What time is it?
Consider how young you are, and question your feelings.
I’ll have to ask you some questions, madam.
Tie him to this chair.—You’ll see, criminal— By the gods, it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard.
But did you see them dead?
They say there are only five people on it.
Let’s sit here and let the music fill our ears.
Here’s mine.
If you’ll take a simple man’s advice, don’t be here when it arrives.
But she’s modest and ladylike too.
He’s getting worse and worse.
Claim fair England’s peace depends on this alliance.
Exactly right.
Oh, these fools!
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave!
Let’s get out of here.
That’s the truth.
Let’s not, Brutus.
Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than doomsday?
The rain, the wind, the thunder and lightning are not my daughters.
It is “music with her silver sound,” because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds.
Go ahead—rage till your proud heart breaks.
You’re giving him a present?
Don’t you have a letter for me from the friar?
But if you have the stomach for it, you’ll have all the help from me you need.
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful.
No wonder she’s waiting to get married.
I hate him so much it makes me sick, and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy.
These are ugly antics.
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay?
Leave out the water.
They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up.
Stay warm.
She’s dead, I think.—Help, uncle!—Hero, why Hero!
I repeat, spread the rumor that Anne, my wife, is sick and likely to die.
We already knew that.
When I work it over with magic spells, the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions.
A daughter?
When you have to steal your own wives some day, I’ll wait for you just as long.
Shake off your sleepiness.
Get up.
And you called the fairy creature harmless, monster.
Well, Syracusian, tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus.
Again, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
And I’ll tell him about the letter too.
Your children will be kings.
It’s a job meant for a man, but not you.
Well.
Romeo!
The three of you have killed a sweet, innocent woman.
And I regret having bragged to the messenger about how my enemies were being butchered at Pomfret while I, as I said, was in good standing with Richard.
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them.
Yes, and one other place, if you’ll only let me name it.
Hey, look over there!
I’m Launcelot, who was your boy, is your son, and will be your child.
Give me a little breathing space, my lord, a little pause to think.
What were those things?
Go.
Was he sent by Count Orsino?
Shut up, you doddering old wizard!
Please, master, tell me.
I recognize something about that voice.
Give me your hand, Roderigo.
All the worse that she stooped this low, then.
I’ll go with you, my lord, if you’ll allow me.
I’ve always been straightforward with you, so now I’m telling you what I think.
Stop right now!
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats.
Oh, here she comes.
Don’t stay here, go away.
Tell her that the king, who has the power to command people, asks her.
Sweet Sir Andrew!
She can’t hurt you, Helena.
Wake up when something nasty is nearby.
Who is leading his men?
You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest of your new master.
I’m ready and waiting.—Give me your hand, Bassanio.
He is.
Lose nothing?
I’m just worried that you’ve been cozying up to her, and gotten intimate with her.
He and his daughter are captured.
Do you want to hear it again?
I swear, I’m telling you what I honestly think.
No, no, they wouldn’t.
Who greets me so early in the morning?
I stretch my joke for that word “fat.” If you add that word to the word “goose,” it shows that you are a fat goose.
You think he’s special, since you’ve only ever seen him and Caliban.
Take a few steps—I want to see you walk.
You are welcome here.
Never, my lord.
The house will be so much quieter.
We’ll revenge his death.
A sweet woman!
But quiet.
Macbeth.
Le Roy?
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.
How did you tolerate prison?
Look!
So please rest.
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours.
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up.
The door’s right here.
That’s true.
Please forgive me if I’m mistaken, my lord—but I can’t keep quiet when I think you’re being insulted.
Could the lead one contain it?
Therefore, do your duty and take your reward, because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death.
I’ll have to do something courageous then, because I hate intrigue.
Where’s my fool?
I wish they were, so that I could die right now, because, at this point, I live a living death.
Will you be having dinner with her tonight?
On the way, we came across my wife, her sister, and their gang of vile associates.
Let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that again.
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot?
Now you’re talking.
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio will guarantee it.
I will too.
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
But, hang on!
Some people kiss shadows.
Did old Bellario send you here?
Oh, my good lord, don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing.
The hour of death is approaching.
I don’t know.
Please, corporal, stop!
What’s your profession?
Francis Flute, the bellows-repairman?
I will either get you out, lying if I have to, or stay in prison in your place.
Until then, my noble friend, think about this: I’d rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through.
It is the best horse in Europe.
You know tomorrow is her wedding day.
I told you not to hang around my house.
Here I am, Theseus.
I’d send seven of my servants to go get him.
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed.
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year, I swore I’d never speak to them again.
Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say.
Halt.
So young, my lord, and honest.
I’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria.
I’ll be no king of England if I’m not also king of France.
Where?
Get out of here.
Say what you want, but I know what I know.
Live, Brutus!
Bring us some wine!
It’s stopped now—it must be played for some local god of the island.
Where is my lovely bride?
Uncle of Exeter, release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me.
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time?
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we’re talking all about her.
The person who suffers alone suffers the most.
Goneril, you aren’t worth the dust the wind blows in your face.
For there never was a pretty woman who didn’t like to preen in the mirror.
I’d say the same thing, but I’m afraid I’d be faced out of my way.
Show it!
It’s clear that someone less noble, less loyal, more bloody-minded than Clarence but not a blood relation, deserves as bad an end as my brother, but he goes free.
Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all.
Or walk either.
I guess it’s only one man—no big deal.
As I slept under this yew-tree here, I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him.
Did you notice how the queen’s guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence’s death?
I have my naked sword out.
Will she go to bed now?
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately.
He’d better not speak badly of Brutus here.
Lead the way.
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship.
What an annoying man, this guy is!
He’ll kill me with tortures.
Or any of you?
I think I can do that.
I wish you well.
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first.
Clarence is still alive; Edward is not only alive, he’s king.
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life.
This forest doesn’t seem deserted when you’re here, because you are all the world to me.
Please, follow straight after me.
Wake up my whole household!
When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him.
Of course he is, and so are you.
You can’t party your way into dukedoms there.
I’m happy to meet you, my lady and my wife.
Just tell me.
Think about it.
Look who’s here!
But I’ve been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list, and I can’t read!
Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are!
Oh, is that so?
Before you got so angry, I never would have thought that.
You’ve kept away from me for a week?
Where are my slippers?
Who are you, coming so fast in this quiet night?
You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.
It doesn’t look that way to me.
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection!
Go on!
Listen, listen!
He told us to arrange it.
My liege.
You are Antonio, you are he.
How will you get proof?
There’s something else to be done.
It’s impossible.
Ugly, wrinkled witch, what are you doing here?
I did—and now I’ve got it!
He’s only known you for three days, but he’s already treating you like a close friend.
His speech was like a tangled chain.
You know me too well.
Send out more cavalry.
There, where the torch is burning.
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?
I thank you all.
How’s that?
But then I do you wrong to say as much, since you are the very embodiment of bravery.
What happened, general?
I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore.
If we do, it’ll drive us crazy.
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now.
He must’ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he’s using it on a jester.
Why are you yelling at me so angrily?
Knock at the gate?
Give me some trinket of yours, and I will wear it in my hat.
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go.
I bet she’s fast asleep.
There’s two—a man and a woman.
Now sit down, everybody, and rehearse your parts—Pyramus, you start.
Where should we go?
Go to bed right this minute.
The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to.
Didn’t you figure out that I left you because I hate you?
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked.
Answer me like men.
I’ll marry the earl of Warwick’s youngest daughter, Lady Anne.
No, my good lord.
Now get out of here.
To the breach, to the breach!
Have a good life.
What’s wrong with you?
What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset.
Yes.
Okay, just stay quiet.
You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke, if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens.
Tell us, Bottom.
If you steal my money, you’re just stealing trash.
Oh, God help me!
No, it’s Casca, someone who’s going to work with us.
Yes, I’ll say it again, my lord.
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned.
You have to be patient with me.
Why, he told me so himself, and he said he didn’t care who knew it.
Oh, my handsome nephew, I must not say that.
Signior Gremio, are you coming from the church?
Tell me right now and stop fooling: where’s the money?
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt?
It’s not lost, but what if it were?
No, my lord.
Heaven help me, I don’t know you, sir.
His attendants are desperate, violent men.
He’s very handsome and speaks well, but he’s very young.
I’ll commute your death sentence.
My child, my reason for living, wake up, look up, or I’ll die with you!
Cassio, how did you get my wife’s handkerchief?
I’m sorry I was so wrong about him.
May God in His mercy forgive you.
Where’s the king?
Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell.
Let’s go!
Bring me the handkerchief—My mind is full of doubt.
Shall we get to work?
Take them away.
Sir, you’re old.
Back when I was a schoolboy, if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction, watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first.
The king is not responsible for it.
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude, not as a fee.
You’ve pretended to be in love with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight, and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents, flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an impressionable young person.
Be  Conrade!
Weren’t we both born under Taurus?
This is beyond words and beyond belief!
I can put him in the right mood, and I’ll bring him to the Capitol.
There’s no place I’d rather die than here by Caesar, and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you, the masters of this new era.
Let life be short so that shame won’t last too long.
No, not a chance.
Give me my veil.
First of all, even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown—if it were truly my birthright—I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it.
Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam.
I know where I’ll wear this dagger, then.
Where’s your master?
My thoughts were never on money.
Listen to me, for I have something to tell you.
It’s best to rehearse there, because if we do it here in the city, we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play.
So tell me, Grumio, how goes the world?
A good fool.
I beg your pardon, except for the widow Dido.
No, let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood.
Don’t just swear by it; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me.
I was ordered not to.
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter.
His horse is killed, so he’s fighting on foot, risking his life to search out Richmond.
Come out, beautiful sun—until I’ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in, I’ll watch my shadow as I stroll along.
Who’s that coming over here?
Oh!
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup.
We shall, my liege.
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples.
But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?
A night isn’t much time for addressing matters of this importance.
Look here, this is the entrance to his room.
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that!
But, sir, here comes your servant.
We’ll be there.
I’m here, I’ve been destroyed by villains!
Well then, I’ll say this quickly: the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.
I hear you say “proud” and “I thank you,” and then “no thank you” and “not proud,” you spoiled little girl.
I’m not a man who talks a lot, but I thank you.
Good.
Do you really think so?
Look how shapely your legs are.
I’d feel sorry for them, if I were human.
And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about restraint!
I’d do anything to bring them back together, since I really care for Cassio.
Get lost!
Good for you, holding out on me like this!
No, I swear on my honor, I haven’t, madam.
Gentleness is the only way to go—gently, gently.
If that were true, then I’d know your secret.
I saw it with my own eyes.
My husband said she was unfaithful!
He has called for his horse, but I don’t know where he’s headed.
Here’s a goat for you.
Do you smell something naughty?
God gives those gifts—I had nothing to do with it.
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl.
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine.
I won’t listen to your pleas or excuses.
If you sit down, I’ll carry your logs a while.
But if he’s resistant and chilly, then be like that too and break off the conversation.
Be on guard duty tonight.
God be with you and keep you, and may he heal your head.
I’m going.
What’s this, my lord?
Because you gave me something for nothing.
I hate it and want all good men’s love.
And the one who commands us is our king.
Priest.
What’s going on, Othello, darling?
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully, if it made your life easier.
I’d be very grateful to you if you did.
The crown was offered to him three times?
Are we all ready?
No, my lord.
The gods do this to test my bravery.
But we can talk more about that tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both.
Here, here, sir!
Does it really make sense, once we divide the world into three parts, that he should be one of the three rulers?
Don’t be cruel, Demetrius.
Indeed, they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow, and he’ll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy.
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes.
Would raise babies and clip coupons.
It’s true, they’re inconsistent.
But a handkerchief— God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief!
So please, most gracious duke, order her to bring him out so we can get him some help.
I sink under the heavy weight of love.
Look, he’s approaching Caesar.
A basting.
Keep an eye on Cinna.
Where’s the Master?
Try to get him to do that.
All I’m asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew.
Didn’t you hear her, guys?
Though I expect she’ll wear me out more quickly than I’ll wear out what I’m wearing—which will be good for her and even better for me!
Revenge!
He’s a lord to a lord and a man to a man.
This island belongs to me because Sycorax, my mother, left it to me.
Do I look as pale as everyone else does, Lord Dorset?
Then I’ll change it to this: Father Time himself is bald, so for all time there will be bald men.
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles, he can always kill himself.
Well, go on your way, then.
To Baptista Minola’s house.
I wonder if the lion’s going to talk.
I say you’re not.
This is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men.
I thought the clouds were talking to me, the winds were singing to me, and the thunder, like an awful organ pipe, roared Prospero’s name.
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss.
I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache.
Did you see him enter this abbey?
While we’re talking here, a royal battle could be won and lost.
It’s coming toward me.
Good man, why are you crying?
My lady, with your permission, this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss.
I spoke angry, foul words to him, and with that I will kiss you.
Lay me next to my mistress.
How dare you talk about kindness or shame.
Thank you for his present and your trouble.
Your physical health matters more than your reputation.
Go to bed, dear.
I’ll answer for you.
Just remember who you’ve got on board with you, good man.
Sir, the person who should sing that song isn’t here.
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought?
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination.
If you refuse, let an eternal curse fall on you.
I can tell your Majesty, the duke is a brave man.
Your vote will be as strong as anyone’s in the reordering of the government.
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him.
Look at me crying—what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy.
Toward Chertsey, noble lord?
Call my sister that.
That’ll keep them from being afraid.
If he cannot, let the tailor mend him.
I do hate 
But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrain myself.
Andrew Aguecheek”
Stop, sir, for God’s sake!
Get up, liar.
Have I waited so long to see this morning, only to see this?
Believe me, I’m not.
Certainly.
Ah, don’t tear yourself away from me!
Is the news good or bad?
Away, get out of here.
Come here, Sir Seacole.
Get them in here.  
This is a sleepy tune.
Flies are like free men, but I have been banished.
Nonsense.
Who was it?
I needn’t be ashamed of your Majesty, God be praised, so long as your Majesty is an honest man.
Oh, that’s nonsense!
Where is he, in his bed?
He’s a very dishonest, puny boy, and more cowardly than a rabbit.
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight.
Do that, and I’ll set you free in two days.
All right, we’ll see you at dinnertime.
I’ll warm myself by blowing on the fire.
If I live long enough to touch you again, that would be as good as having my eyesight back.
I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town.
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships.
You always know he’s got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto.
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother.
Will you take me, my lady?
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great, I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey’s camp.
I see the downfall of my family.
There’s little or nothing of that.
When your mind is at peace, your body is sensitive to the elements.
Blow the trumpet!
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves, my sister drowned.
As for myself, I didn’t dare laugh, for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air.
Gold, silver, and common lead.
I tell you, this house is as dark as ignorance.
That’s Claudio.
Get out of my face.
Take this garment, put it on, and then come back here.
My friends, listen.
With anger, with fever, or with hunger, sure, my friend, but never sick with love.
God bless your Worship!
I’m coming.
The money you owe me for the necklace.
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond, and Buckingham, backed by a hardy Welsh army, is on the march.
What then?
Excellent.
All you English princes, I salute you.
I’m dying to see the prince.
And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command.
Why, no, boy.
If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face.
A fine ship, with some good people in it, I’m sure, smashed to pieces.
Indeed, the enemy nearly took the bridge, but he was forced to retreat, and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge.
Caesar was a tyrant.
That’s what her mother always tells me.
I don’t have to give you answers that you like.
Who is it?
Tell him my fury will abate, and I’ll take the crowns.
I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you.
You want me to say what I’m thinking?
If he’s got a message from the count, tell him I’m sick, or not home.
Good gentlemen, give me permission to speak.
If they’d put you in the stocks for asking that question, you would’ve deserved it.
If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head, I would’ve killed them all in revenge.
Where the devil can Romeo be?
And in the morning I’ll take you to your ship and we’ll sail to Naples, where I hope to see this loving couple married.
How did this happen?
I’m putting myself in God’s hands, and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder.
I can tell you’re furious, but I don’t understand what you’re saying.
Sir, I’m upset.
Stand away from the body.
Are you insane, old man?
What a pretty picture, three fools all together.
You’re a lying, cowardly wretch.
With her, on top of her—however you want to say it.
Beware Macduff.
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings.
By next week, I’ll be able to pay you.
No, instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions.
Oh God, remember to hear her prayer for them, just as for us!
But you’ve seen her and Cassio together.
Really, I think your other ruff is better.
Good father, I’m begging you on my knees, be patient and listen to me say just one thing.
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia’s: she
Me, marry her?
The answer, my dear, is that they didn’t dare, because the people of Milan loved me too much.
rules my life.” Hmm, let me see, let me see, let me see.
But by the grace of God, she’s mine.
And she’s fierce, even though she’s little.
I remember a fight, but not why we were fighting.
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly.
That’s true, and with good reason.
Yes, well, things could get better.
Why so pale, my friend?
He can act as brave as he wants, but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames, and I wish he were, too, and I with him, whatever the danger, so long as we were far away from here.
It will give you some protection from this storm.
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen?
When the day comes, I’ll wish it were nighttime, so I could sleep with the legal expert’s clerk.
Bottom, you’re Pyramus.—And Flute, you’re Thisbe.
You won’t, then?
I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date.
Take this mad wretch to jail.—Father-in-law Baptista, will you see that he’s available to appear in court?
Mercy, mercy!
Sir!
Yes.
But do you mean what you’re saying?
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit.
Aren’t you Romeo?
That’s why it’s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues, like I do.
No, I’m telling you, put on this robe and beard.
That’s true, that’s very true.
Oh, only time can sort out this mess.
Do you think it’s a good idea to rush?
Look!
Lord, may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that.
Yes, like that.
I know him well by reputation.
Ladies, you’re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people.
What is my nation?
Yes, the leader of the team; the one that gets you if you can’t pay a debt; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them, “Have arrest.” Well, sir, stop your joking there.
Here.
Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello.
This feather moved because of her breath.
His nurse, grandmother.
Until then, think about the well-being of Rome.
What have you found out?
Nothing that you want to hear, my lord, but nothing so bad that I can’t mention it.
Anything that’s mended is only patched up.
Most royal sir, Fleance has escaped.
Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house?
The enemy’s losses have been very great, pretty substantial.
My brave relative!
Dromio, tell the servants to prepare for lunch.
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment.
There’s still a spot here.
Don’t you, Dromio?
It’s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn’t introduce them.
I pay you because you’re poor, not because you want me to buy this.    
Oh, evil, evil!
Oh, Lord, this makes me laugh!
Please, sir, have patience.
What is your name?
Why, that’s my dainty Ariel singing now.
Like hell!
But look, even if my dishes are poor, eat them with my best wishes.
Everyone says you can’t make up your mind.
Come, take away the  Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton.
Fast asleep?
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night.
You take your beauty sleep now.
Even the fragile wren, the smallest of birds, will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest.
I’ll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars.
But I just can’t love him.
This is what happens when you act rashly.
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.
And after this I’ll be good and hope you forgive me.
Not with any sauce they could provide for them.
Go to the church.
How can you test them like that?
Now, on my life, the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes, whom she adores.
There was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them, that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you, that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches, and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it.
And then?
You don’t know a thing!
I’m an ass, I’m a woman’s servant, and I’m beside myself.
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums, the flute and the splendid banners, and all those proud displays and pageantry of war!
Yeah, right—you sent me to get whipped.
Don’t come near till you hear me call you.
Hope with good cause is swift; it flies as fast as a swallow.
And I’m her father as well.
But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view?
Go, you old housewife, go.
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions, and so they go unpunished.
Your wife, sir, your wife.
What did your song mean, lady?
And everything will be alright, I promise you, wife.
Stop.
Hopefully, your wedding day is only postponed.
I accept your devotion with my deepest love.
But that’s not part of what I’m supposed to say.
She’s not even fourteen.
Look out, I’m on my way up.
Hermia is lucky, wherever she is, because she has beautiful eyes.
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way, and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages, nothing taken that is not paid for, none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language.
Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it.
Why are you leaving, my angry friend?
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say.
It’s time for you to know the whole story.
If only I could somehow relate them to me!
Can someone fall in love this quickly?
My lord, I don’t think I cried out.
I can’t do everything I want to, but I’ll help you as well as I can.
Her blood has stopped, and her joints are stiff.
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek.
Well, my friends, you’ve got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies, they’d have no choice but to execute us.
Captain Macmorris, when we have more leisure, see, I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare, and that’s that.
If our father continues to use his authority as usual, then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us.
I’m sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities.
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks.
You won it.
It’s a common  What?
Places, everyone!
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth.
Ask your husband if you doubt me.
They plan to spend the night in Sardis.
I’m sure he’s somewhere on the island.
Maria!
I’ll bite you on the ear for that joke.
Madam, good night.
And what about that?
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered?
I’m going to the Friar to find out his solution.
I’ll have you two hide—and the fool too—right where he’ll find the letter.
Well, that’s the same thing.
Look, here are the boxes, prince.
Now be quiet.
And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all.
God bless you and make you obedient, loving, and kind.  
Now, please, I beg you, don’t work so hard.
Often, when I’m dulled by worry and melancholy, he lightens my mood with his merry pranks.
It’s a bet.
The world’s huge.
What do you say, Signior Gremio?
What’s my name?
Everyone else, march on with me.
From now on, goodness in women, not superficial beauty, will win my heart.
You sing, and I’ll dance.
Oh, this day has turned into a disaster!
Good lieutenant, is your general married?
By the door.
Enough of your magic spells, you hateful, withered hag.
She’s too much for me to handle.
Stay invisible.
For the same thing.
I am ready for you.
Well, you know, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Anyway, I was part of the trick, sir.
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her.
I’m sure there was a herd of lions nearby.
Why are you talking about robbery?
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
Don’t simply hide your hatred.
Well, there you go.
Give it to me.
It’s mine and I’m going to get it.
Destiny chooses when you’ll die and who you’ll marry.
Goodbye, old friend.
Antipholus, aren’t you originally from Corinth?
I remember your eyes quite well.
Where am I going?
What do you think of this fool, Malvolio?
Why do you care that he loves Hermia?
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig, her hair as brown as hazelnut shells, and she herself sweeter than the kernels.
He really was tricked horribly.
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection, I’ll be your mirror and show you, without exaggeration, things inside you that you can’t see.
Make yourself comfortable.
Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight.
You scoundrel!
Oh, Fate, come, come to me, with hands as pale as milk.
No.
Lovely, most lovely Katherine, will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours?
I’ll remember.
Please, do me this one favor: find out what I’ve done to offend this knight.
I did not kill your husband.
Only describing what you have ruined.
So can I.
With Rosaline, father?
She was lying even as she was going down to hell.
How clever of you.
I’ll give my life for you, just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don’t love you.
He thinks he’s still playing his instrument.
Here was a Caesar!
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army.
Quiet!
What did you say?
Are you with a Cornish company?
I swear, before I die I’m going to see you sick with love.
Thank you, Tubal.
Not me, believe me.
Tell me to run, and I’ll run.
Amen, amen.
Let’s give them room.
Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little the worse for drink, killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage, see.
I don’t
My granddaughter, with her kind aunt, the duchess of Gloucester, leading her by the hand?
What was the last cry for?
Wait, don’t stand next to each other.
Can we do that?
That’s true.
Since this prize is yours, Be happy with it, and don’t look for a new one.
Is she enclosed in silver, which is ten times less valuable than gold?
Who are these people?
I should really leave right away.
Snakes shed their skin there, and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill.
I swear to God you’re accusing me wrongly!
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately, and bring me their interpretation of the results.
You know that we parted only seven years ago, in Syracuse.
Yes, let’s go to sleep.
Where did you die?
Fa, sol, la, mi.
Twenty thousand crowns now, and half my lands after my death.
Therefore, the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety.
Goodbye, Goodbye!
You may come across better food, but not a warmer welcome.
All I have to do is remove it.
What a worthy man!
Keep your word.
How is my wife?
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed?
I’d never heard such raucous music, such pleasant thunder.
They’re out to get me, and I won’t stand for it!
Won’t King Richard let me speak with him?
Who should begin?
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone.
Whether it’s even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she’ll be fourteen.
You’re wrong to kill me for loving you.
Oh, I was such a beast to be angry at him.
And this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way.
God bless you, my friend, and your music too.
I will live in your heart, die in your lap, and be buried in your eyes—and, what’s more, I will go with you to your uncle’s.
When will there be another like him?
I’d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports, piers, and waterways.
Leave you alone!
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you, but his mother wouldn’t let him.
And you have mercy on me too!
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse.
I wish my eyes were 
almost read people’s thoughts.
The devil’s after me!
I had no reason, no reason.
Their forces are nearby.
To answer your question, ma'am—yes, he was friendly with those knights.
Farewell, brother.
No, you can’t do that until you take her hand and, in front of this friar, swear to marry her.
If you like, Brakenbury, you can listen to anything we say.
So when should he come?
Anyway, Jessica, go inside.
Listen, in books they say that true love always faces obstacles.
Metellus Cimber?
Oh, now you weep, and I sense that you feel pity.
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that.
Nature, I don’t accuse your weather of unkindness.
Actually, I should.
Anything.
Hide her for a while in your house, and tell everyone that she has, in fact, died.
I hope you think I’m faithful to you.
That’s her father and his friends, who’ve been roused out of bed.
Then she has no choice but to hate you, as you purchased her love with murder.
Then I have to assume you don’t want him to be king.
My soul depends on it— A thousand times good night.
Your two sons?
Not that we love words more than fighting, like you do.
Then Antony offered it the third time.
Where is she now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No more of that, my lord, no more of that.
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what’s tormenting me—how ungrateful my children are!
Music, listen!
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear king, to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire.
I’m not drunk.
Me too, Lord!    
We’re not saying anything treasonous, man.
Beat—
Stay, lovely Helena.
Fury, Fury!—Get over there, Tyrant, there.
Out in the world, I’m like a drop of water, trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean.
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy.
Are we all here?
Go on ahead.
He’ll accompany my wife, and bring whatever else you think I might need.
In this recent storm.
It’s good to grow.
Please, don’t mention her.
Undress the statues if they’re decorated in honor of Caesar.
Who do you think you are, keeping me out of my own house?
Most mighty sovereign, you have no reason to doubt my friendship.
You’ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty, and yet you, the murderer, look as bright and clear as a star in the sky.
Your mother sends her blessings.
Where are you, Pindarus?
I’ll take all who served Brutus into my service.
Farewell.
Gloucester, Gloucester, I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
Here, 
He claimed to know that already too, and said that’s the reason he’s come to speak with you.
I’ll fight you.
No, cousin, I’m going to Fife.
I’ll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice.
Alas, I hate myself instead, because of the hateful deeds I’ve committed.
Ha, ha, ha!
Why, how could she have been murdered?
Or just a foretaste of it?
Whether your mouth is black or white, Do-dee, dee-dee da.
I loved this man so much it makes me weep.
Be patient, I’m telling you.
Oh sir, I accept.
Heaven help him!
Good, I’m satisfied.
Is that what he says?
Stay, then.
Well, death is the end for everybody.
Now, sir, where is Claudio?
I wish I could see that man someday!
It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua.
Right over to that  I hope he enjoys her.
If you don’t mind, I need to rest a bit.
A guy like that is bigger than an ape, but the ape could be his doctor, it’s so much smarter.
My worthy Cawdor!
Now, Baptista, let’s turn to your younger daughter.
I don’t know, ma'am.
I’ll give you frets!” With that, she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through,
Which plays, what music?
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life!
The things men do daily, not knowing what they’re doing!
Or maybe I’ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay.
Bridegroom?
But, oh no!
Take your penalty.
Enough.
I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk.
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet.
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest, looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot, and I scolded her and argued with her.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
Do you love me?
Are we bothering you?
Go back to my sister’s.
He was so sharp when he was in school.
All right, we’ll have a prologue then.
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio.
If I didn’t have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell.
Mutton?
That’s how Claudio will respond.
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own.
When Caesar says “do this,” it is done.
But sir, he’s crazy.
Have patience and endure.
Where’s he going?
Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love.
She’s the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before.
Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.
My only sin was loving you too much.
Don’t take Helena’s side.
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence’s troubles.
Lie down right there.  
What a miracle!
Romeo is hateful, even though God isn’t.
Or, if you don’t mind, come to my home, and I’ll wait for you.
What have you two sisters done?
Love cools off, friendships break up, and brothers become enemies.
The larger part, the main body of cavalry, are coming with Cassius.
It’s so scary to look down!
Hello!
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I already told her to come.
Oh, honey!
They’ve recorded my crimes, and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story.
Me too.
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France, achieving and accomplishing everything I’ve assembled them to do?
He left behind myself and my twin sister, who was born in the same hour as me.
But I would kill you by petting you too much.
I’m not feeling well—that’s all.
He is in love with Hero.
That’s uncivilized and unnatural!
My lord, please go inside here.
If you can’t, and would prefer to leave, she’s very willing to say goodbye to you.
Have you spoken to him?
I never saw Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
I’ve heard many of the noblest Romans—next to immortal Caesar—speaking of you, complaining of the tyranny of today’s government, and wishing that your eyes were working better.
He’s still sleeping, ma'am.
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.
Dear God, thank you!
This way, my lord.
Each of you, give me your bloody hand.
We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours.
I’m ready now.
And the Prince and Claudio, who accused her, are innocent as well, because they were deceived by Don John.
He’s just Launcelot.
Now, let it work.
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know, and who doesn’t know you!
Come, bring me to them.
If you can think of a more awful title, I’ll call her that.
Don’t play any nasty tricks on me.
Yes, but these English are seriously short of beef.
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk, York’s comrade and equal in brave wounds.
Tell your wife to watch her.
Not even to get her fan, or her gloves, or her mask, or anything?
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches.
Is his army approaching?
They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart.
If we happen to offend you, it’s because we want to.
What should I say to her?
Have you come from Bellario’s office in Padua?
Won’t he join us?
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them—and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house.
No, from the moon, I’m telling you.
Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things!
Judge for yourself.
Good evening to your Worship, good Captain James.
Here he comes.
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed.
I know you’ll say “yes,” and I’ll believe you.
Listen to you, instructing me like a parrot would.
I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do.
I hope maybe then you’ll send him back home soon.  
He answered, “You penniless bastard!
I don’t like it.
Malcolm!
And she’s loyal, as she has proven.
Leave him alone.
Mighty duke, look here and see a man who’s been treated most terribly!
He speaks roughly, but what he says is smart, and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him.
He has one ship bound for Tripoli, another heading for the Indies.
Get away from me, you ass!
First you taught me how to beg, and now I think you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered.
Good night then, Casca.
Father, wife, friends—farewell!
Sweet Moon, I thank you for your sunny beams.
There’s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea.
You threw it at her rudely, and she wants you to take it back.
That’s the way of the world.
You notorious whore!
With all my heart, I’ll join you.
We will wait on you, your majesty.
Aren’t the others waiting for me, Cinna?
Those cowardly, gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef.
You lie.
I think so.
Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight.
Who’s been with her?
Sir, do you know who I am?
I tell you, you can use it to get your shoes fixed.
You’re overstepping your bounds now.
No, master, I’ve been changed in both mind and body.
A friend should put up with his friend’s weaknesses, but you exaggerate mine.
Yes, those are the best clothes.
Caesar wouldn’t take the crown.
The king of Naples, my arch-enemy, listens to my brother’s request, which was that the king, in exchange for the respect and money paid to him, would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead.
Honestly, she is too ill-tempered.
You can’t mean what you’re saying.
I’m a fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now.
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple.
Well, well.
Let’s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner.
How do you feel?
And then, I hope, you’ll be satisfied.
Even if the news is sad, tell me with a smile on your face.
Give me that boy and I’ll come with you.
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with.
That Lodovico is a good-looking man.
We’re still just beginners when it comes to crime.
And I know that by now they’re waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey’s theater.
Oh, make them joyful!
May good fortune come to you, good Petruchio!
Saddle up my horses.
Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while.
She can turn and turn, and then turn on you again.
Stop Harry of England, who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur.
It’s best just to let him go.
Don’t greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes.
Oh heaven, oh earth, witness what I’m about to say, and reward me if I tell the truth!
Yes, we get the idea.
Ha, banishment?
Come along with me.
He’s left them to you and to your heirs forever—public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax.
Do you see this sweet sight?
The moon’s bright tonight.
Master Constable, you’re going about this all wrong.
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property, I’m happy, as long as he lets me have the other half in trust, to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter.
Were you dreaming, Lucius?
All right then, confess and live.
This is not a maiden, as you say, but an old man—wrinkled, faded, and withered.
But I guess it doesn’t matter.
Who am I then?
I’ll be off before you are.
Consider how poorly this reflects on me.
You always slip out of the argument like this.
I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water.
Have them come in.
I’ll talk to you more about this some other time.
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face, you cowardly boy.
It’s probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey, thinking to spend the night here.
Here’s to you!
Dear gods in heaven, what’s the reason for this?
Oh, heaven help me!
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore?
You were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly, a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body.
One criminal punishes another.
Caesar, beware of Brutus.
I couldn’t go to Mantua because I was stuck there.
If you choose that one, I’m yours, along with the picture.
Is Cassius nearby?
Yes, your Highness.
This isn’t a good moment for jokes—save them till a happier time.
Oh Nerissa, my poor little body is tired of this great big world.
Very clever!
Death, which has taken her away to make me cry, now ties up my tongue and won’t let me speak.
Fool, do not flatter yourself.
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor.
Thank you for asking, uncle.
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him, and I laughed and refused to flee with him.
Welcome, Publius.
Quiet!
If love has touched you, love has touched you—end of story.
Messala!
If it’s really you, tell me what happened to our son, who floated away with you on that deadly raft.
The wooing is like a Scottish jig: hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion.
You tell her, widow!
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior.
I was sure that you hadn’t given it to me.
Why do you spit at me?
Your slander has broken her heart, and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb—ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness.
Then he swore he was a stranger here.
A wonderful miracle!  
Excuse me, sir.— Tom’s chilly.
Where’s your servant 
That must mean a sword.
That’s what’s clever about it.
My brother’s servants used to be my equals.
I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner’s call is to keep her from sleeping—
They’ve turned me into food for worms.
And don’t say all of that yet.
The wildest animal isn’t as cruel as you are.
This is a rotten song to sing at a man’s funeral.
He has his moods and his ways.
Oh Ratcliffe, I had a terrifying dream!
I’ll meet you at the ferry.
Keep my lover quiet.
He wants to eat the English.
Don’t reply.
Our era should be ashamed!
Agreed.
If everyone here knows us but we don’t know anybody, it’s time, I think, for us to pack our bags and take off.
It must be something I did accidentally.
Pray you sit still.
Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts.
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” Must give everything—for what?
Trebonius knows his cue.
Though science can explain them away, disasters still come after eclipses.
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest?
And in return for this gift, he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms.
You’re sure the handwriting is your brother’s?
Political business is bothering him, and he’s just taking it out on you.
Hello, everyone!
Caesar is listening.
Is it a habit of his?
Listen, Fairy King.
Where else would she be?
Don’t cry, don’t cry.
No.
Do you have what I told you to get?
Like medicine for a sick man.
Give my regards to your daughter.
What’s amazing is how long he lasted.
Don’t go,” says my conscience.
The whole town will riot!
Sir, I leave you to your own contentment.
Now, my dear friend, what lucky wind blows you in from Verona?
I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around. 
Then I beat my drum, at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes, looking around for the source of my music.
If it’s work for a man, I’ll do it.  
Your servant Kent.
By Jesus, I think they will blow up everything if we don’t improve our tactics.
Women are lucky, then.
The  Get out of here!
In that case, leave our cousin Katherine here with us.
He has a very gloomy attitude.
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having.
Apparently you think there’s nothing unusual about a bloody head.
Have his daughters made him crazy like this?—Couldn’t you have kept something for yourself?
In short, I’m not.
Don’t snap at me.
Get it ready immediately.
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world.
Get going now.
Bless you, master.
Go and tell them this.
Look out, here she comes.
He must be possessed by the devil.
For a full half hour.
Come out.
Receive all the blessings of a happy father.
Remember the reward we’re getting when the deed’s done.
You can see my ribs so well you can count them.
Edmund is dead, my lord.
Mistress, think about your end—beware of your death!
When you’ve finished, you’ll be a happy man.
Yes, my good lord.
Let the world collapse around us.
Go bring them all here; I give you power over them.
If you insist on trying my patience any further, then take out your sword right now.
I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do.
I’ll be with you right away.
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post?
If I didn’t have so many enemies in Orsino’s court, I’d go join you there.
Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you.
No, to the Whitefriars monastery.
Any strange beast there can be considered a man.
Go to hell, you whore!
Though I said my name was Benedick, I heard this news with Claudio’s ears.
Yours, if we’re talking about  I’m leaving.
Why aren’t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up?
Get to it, be lustful, sleep around—I need soldiers for my army.
Let me see you dance. 
Cassio can have my job.
Look, he can become invisible.
And why did you come?
What news do you bring?
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved.
Grumio, get me my horse.
And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point.
Then she was even more an angel, and you’re an even blacker devil!
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning?
It’s a wonder you didn’t lose your life and your mind all at once.—He’s waking up.
If I can’t have an estate by birthright, then I’ll get it by being clever.
This is going even better than I planned.
What, my dear lord?
Don’t take too long, unless you want our king to come after me to ask what’s holding things up, because he’s already landed here.
What is the matter here?
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself, when you don’t give any now?
Fair enough.
Where’s America and the West Indies?
As faithful as flies in rotting meat, which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows.
My love, my life, my soul, beautiful Helena!
Good Prince, say something!
It’s strange that you haven’t heard.
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country.
I’m that great gust to her fire.
Goodnight, Michael.
Why, so did you.
Well, I recognize this one  Good God!
She’ll have to have it.
I’m very uncomfortable, and that won’t help my case.
Quiet now!
We only drink toasts to my niece.
Let’s lay everything upon the king: our lives, our souls, our debts, our anxious wives, our children, and our sins.” I must bear responsibility for all of it.
Where’s the Master, Boatswain?
I beg your pardon—I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names.
Don’t think about her.
That’s how it will be for some other men, too, who think they’re as safe as you and I, who are well-loved by noble Richard and Buckingham.
Oh, look!
Away with the doddering fool!
It’s the devil speaking through him.
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract, and I’ll go get the money for you right away.
So I can eat lunch.
If I let him go, I’ll have to pay his bail fees myself.
Listen up, uncle.
Edward’s healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England.
What, would you let a snake bite you twice?  
Leave me alone now, Iago.
If that’s true, I think the same thing about you.
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it.
I’m going to Count Orsino’s court.
He’s as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance.— I will indeed.
I think I do.
Are any ships leaving tonight?
Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes.
No, really, I don’t.
Oh my!
He’s very handsome.
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them.
I haven’t come to steal your loyalty, friends.
You kiss like you’ve studied how.
I’ll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part.
I wouldn’t allow any commerce.
I wish I had two fool’s caps and two daughters.
Richard, a fiendish spy for hell itself, still lives, but only long enough to buy souls to send below.
Yes, you have to tell us why, Sir Andrew.
I can’t love him.
She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to you.
It’s true that my brother’s daughter is Queen of Tunis, and heir of Naples.
That’s Cassio’s voice.
Well, lead on.
His name’s Cinna.
I’ve already slept, my lord.
He’ll think these letters are from Olivia and that she’s in love with him.
Shall we get started?
Let’s get out of here!
Very soon, because you want it.
You won’t regret this.
Me too.
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind!
I hope she doesn’t have a crush on me!
Go to my room and put on something of mine.
I’m not a traitor, unfair lady.
Is he here?
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.
Come, come, you are too clever for your own good.
I’ll tell you everything exactly as it happened.
I would have sworn that, too, my lord, especially against Benedick.
I’ll have my lessons in the order and manner 
Well then, add some interjections that indicate laughter, like  Hold on, Friar.
Adieu.
Come on, sir, let’s go.
Do you know Captain Gower?
Well, then, here it is: you must prepare yourself for his knife.
Caesar, I will.
I’m not sleepy at all.
If your Majesties recall it, the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which, your Majesty knows, is to this day a badge of honorable military service.
If you’re smart, you’ll go home.
But wait a minute, please.
That was excellent, really excellent.
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world—or even France or England!
Three miles from here you can see it coming, a moving forest.
I want to hear more about this.
My sons Edward and Clarence!
I’m as crazy as he is, if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent.
Don’t bother with it.
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice.
Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice, and shout “So, so!” Each one of your servants will rush here,
We, now at our largest, can only decrease.
But Macbeth is.
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
There’s not a strand of feather left in our whole army—a good sign, I hope, that we won’t fly away like birds—and time on the field has made us slovenly.
Just look.
Do you carry a pike?
No, it’s not as deep as a well, or as wide as a church door, but it’s enough.
That means it’s more likely to be fake.
That’s right, you stupid thing.
If any of my relatives find you here they’ll kill you because of who you are.
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero; this girl is heir to both our estates.
No, come on, don’t make me play a woman.
I loved wine and gambling, and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem.
And now I’m going to leave your despised company.
But first, I’ll dump this fellow in his grave, then return to my love weeping with grief.
That can’t happen.
Give me your hand, Messala.
If what you say is true, you can do the same to me. 
Stay away for now, and good night, my sweet friend.
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence’s daughter.
Well, did you think about what I said?
Yes it is, you half-blood.
That’s just what I thought.
Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward.
What an enormous thing for us to forget!—Edmund, tell us, where’s the king?
Finally the new moon, curved like a silver bow in the sky, will look down on our wedding celebration.
We say the king is wise and good, and his noble queen is getting old, pretty, and not jealous.
Good Captain Blunt, tell the earl goodnight from me, and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent.
God bless your Grace with health and happy days.
And here he comes, puffing himself up like a turkey.
Oh God, he’s murdered his master!
Like a fire that gets covered up, Benedick should smother his love and waste away.
I won’t have anything to do with it.
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours?
You coward, did you run away from me?
Where did you leave him?
Nerissa’s got the right idea.
I humbly thank you.
Good.
I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony, whom Caesar is so fond of, outlive Caesar.
There is no life, but my love is dead!
Whatever you see first when you wake up, think of it as your true love.
I drew my sword to part them.
If you’re Trinculo, then come out.
Lead us, monster; we’ll follow.
Here comes my lady.
Mine, too.
Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’s doubts all plainly derive from the female.
Hang on a second.
You mean their  Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads—whatever.
Oh, Bottom, you’ve changed!
He’s dressed like a freak, a total freak, and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman’s valet.
A pound of human flesh taken isn’t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef.
Come on!
Please, please tell me!
The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon.
My trusty servant, Ariel!
Has he come home yet?
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss!
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run in the streets as though it were doomsday.
No.
So now everyone will point at me and say, “Look, there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio—if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing!”  
What do you think of his belief?
Are you coming monster?
The king and the prince are praying.
Have them come in front of the master constable.
How are you, my royal lord?
We’re waiting here for you.
Come on.
You devil, you’ve put a spell on her!
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer, noble father-in-law.
Yes, and paid me well for doing it.
Where, good Miss Mary?
I’ll have glory in this losing day—more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest.
Now there can only be the promise.
It’s all over now, and so am I.  Let’s forgive each other.
We’re to be married on Sunday.
Oh, Tranio, until it happened to me, I never would have thought it possible.
What’s there to say?
What do you think?
Here comes Catesby again.
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago.
But sir, have you married my daughter without my consent?
A friend?
Someone knocks.
Cesario, go visit that cruel Olivia one more time.
Well, let’s move on to our work with the living.
Yes, Captain, but with this acknowledgement—that God fought for us.
The second I saw you, my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave, so here I am now, a patient log-man.
Let heaven be my witness—I’m putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othello’s control.
A constant pain to me!
I am not a child or an infant.
He commanded me to wake him up early.
Right on cue, here’s the duke himself.
And you, sister?
Caesar resents me, but he loves Brutus.
Will you meet me right away at Ninny’s grave?
Have you written that down, that they aren’t criminals?
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on?
I’m sorry, sir, but in this war I consider you a subordinate, not my equal.
Take him off to jail!
There isn’t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love.
When his god falls asleep, the monster will snatch his wine bottle.
If they march along unopposed, I will sell my dukedom for a sodden, filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion.
Discipline must be kept.
It’s two o'clock now.
Wait for me there.
Your lord knows what I think.
I have a favor to ask.
My liege, this man is a villain and a traitor, who—see, your Grace—has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alençon’s helmet.
You know that he does.
Is that how it is, really?
Fifteen years!
You’ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before.
It’s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours.
You, sir?
You’ll know about that later.
As it is God’s will and pleasure, Captain, I entreat you to come quickly to the king.
When I opened my eyes, I saw their swords out.
If I told them about this back in Naples, would they believe me?
Is that possible?
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers.
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder—that was your idea of heaven.
Sir, such a life with such a wife is unlikely!
Leave me alone, Desdemona, go away!
Where’s my cousin Toby?
Look at my face.
Though I wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer—just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty, possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate.
He’s too overwhelmed with shame.
Why did he do that?
He says his name’s Poor Tom.
You’ve been competing with this king for my daughter.
What traitor hears me and doesn’t say amen?
In fact, the real nightmare had only just begun.
I’ll come back.
I hope some will fall off tomorrow.
I think you’re an ass.
Look, he’s moving.
Their lips, like four red roses on a stalk, touched.
Speak, man, what’s the matter?
Now, I’ll begin: first, we came down a steep hill, my master riding behind my mistress— Both on one horse?
Horrid villain!
Let’s not leave him out.
So, in the name of God and all the good that will come of this 
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from?
Follow me, then.
Dear Macduff, I beg you, tell us you were lying and say it isn’t so.
Life’s better at 
If you continue treating Hermia so badly, you’ll pay for it.
I’ve lost my name and title to a traitor.
I’ll listen to Brutus.
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too.
If we don’t, it’ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives.
Ever since you lost yours.
Go wherever you want.
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack?
She’s a virtuous and holy lady.
Lighten up.
When Caesar was alive, even he wouldn’t dare anger me like this.
Here comes Lorenzo.
Look out, he’s coming!
Get out of here, you blathering peasant!
If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself.
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry’s return to France.
What support did I have other than Edward?
Yes.
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams.
Please stay seated.
No, sir, I won’t let you go.
You’re a fool.
There’s nothing to get upset about.
That’s true.
I’ll get it done right away.
May I kiss your feet?
Sneaky, dried-up old coot!
I have to tell you, I thought you were a much kinder person than this.
By the light of heaven, no, I would not!
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this.
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I’m not smart, but he wouldn’t bet two cents that you’re not a fool.
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined.
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels!
But tell me this: don’t you know my voice?
What was it that you told me today—that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?
It’s worse than murder to humiliate a king’s messenger like this.
I ask you, if you have a grudge against me, to kill me now, while your stained hands still reek of blood.
Where’s Metellus Cimber?
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here.
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard?
Oh, you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has “Benedick” and “Beatrice” written all over it?
Don’t say anything bad about wine anymore.
Look how lush and healthy the grass is!
I’ll write to my sister and tell her my plans.
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “Caesar!” Speak.
It was addressed to him, and orders must be obeyed.
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest; tomorrow we’ll march on.
What he just said to me—it’s alright.
Stand aside, Captain Gower.
And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me.
My noble lord— What is it, Iago?
break out, civil war erupts, kings are betrayed, and the bond between father and son snaps.
What do you need me to do?
Oh my, Oh my!
Is Clarence dead?
Your whole family will be ruined.
You’re poisoning my eyes.
Who is that gentleman?
I don’t think there’s anywhere I’d rather die than in the king’s company, as his cause is just and honorable.
We’re in.
Oh, you’re so lucky!
I could do it myself.
Why have you gotten so rude?
Yes, we are.
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner.
I’m old and foolish.
But I won’t sleep till I get back.
Do you really think so?
Dear Bassanio, my ships have all been wrecked.
What do you think you’re doing?
Be careful, Signior Baptista, lest you be made the dupe in this business.
For God’s sake, send somebody else.
If you get nasty with me, Pistol, I’ll stab you with my sword, in fair play.
Of all the strange things I’ve ever heard, it seems most strange to me that men fear death, given that death, which can’t be avoided, will come whenever it wants.
Pardon me but I do not know what is “like me.” An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Don’t try to find out more.
Who are you?
Here’s a postscript!.
How?
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave.
Tell me, friend.
Go ahead.
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious.
I’m your love, no matter what you think.
How are you doing, Stephano?
A boy robbed you, but you’ll beat up the post instead.
I swear I will— Come on, let’s go see what happens.
If you knew the reason, you’d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay.
It’s dangerous out there.
I don’t hear anything, madam.
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days.
A little bit.
No, don’t throw any of it away.
My dear Caius, I’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to.
You are building your nest in 
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head, too.
Since your woes are only a portion of mine, I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own.
But I’m overjoyed!
You’re a smart guy.
Ride, ride, Messala.
Why, what’s the matter?
Good day to you, Captain Fluellen.
It’s true.
Nonsense!
What kind of woman is she?
Yes, but now there’s no way to calm him down.
Now this joke has turned serious.
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring.
Is that really what you meant?
You may change your mind later.
Run, my lord, run.
I was born and raised less than three hours from here.
Carry him to my best room—gently, so he doesn’t wake—and hang all my erotic paintings around him.
Is it out of lust?
What is it, my dear Bianca?
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him.
For more important things, you’ll say no.
Where will we meet in the morning?
This land will belong to your and Albany’s children forever.—And now what does my second daughter Regan, the wife of Cornwall, have to say?
Oh, gods, give me patience!
Neighbors, hello.
Then come to my house tomorrow morning, and since you couldn’t be my son-in-law, be my nephew instead.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow.
In any case, do what you want.
Give me an aphrodisiac, pharmacist.
Why is the Jew waiting?
This makes me feel so much better!
Murder and treason!
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you?
Easily, madam.
And you’re not loyal, like us.
He ate at my house, but that doesn’t make me nervous.
Our love, which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air, may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet.
That’s why he hates me.
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle.
I was telling you to go after her, woo her, confront her.
God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older.
We’re going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer.
You’re the one I have to obey.
Gentlemen, let’s go make sure Cassio’s wounds are properly dressed.—Come on, ma'am, you can tell us another story.
Come out, you frightened man.
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi, responding to our challenge before we’ve even challenged him.
You mean the sun!
Go to him from me.
Yes, my lord, but I can spoil it.
Besides that, he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow, and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him, who are at the other, sorry.
Stay with us tonight.
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly.
A piece of ice.
You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told.
He’s pale and hyperventilating, as if a bear were chasing him.
We don’t need to hear it.
You’re wrong, sir, I do care about something.
You who are beautiful beyond words, calm down and let me explain myself.
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them?
No, I don’t—except as a friend.
I like this girl!
I’m wide awake.
Did you talk with this woman?
Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery.
Wherever we go, men will smile at us while hiding daggers.
And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk!
To bed, to bed!
Heaven keep you safe!
In two months—a month before this loan is due—I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments.
That’s enough for one lesson.
Let’s go offer up our lives 
Give me my armor.
Then run away.
Madam, that young man out there says he’s got to speak to you.
Tell him, if he comes here, I’ll explain everything to him and, on my word, he’ll leave unharmed.
Oh, I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that, and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with!
The clock hasn’t struck yet.
Then certain ones.
Although many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful.
Where is the fool I sent on ahead?
I wasn’t born to die on your sword.
Oh, come on now, Kate.
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest, I’d be wise enough to satisfy myself.
But you’re a famous pirate!
I will, my lord.
Halt!
They left me and my servant there, tied together.
What if I went no further and chose this one?
He’s a coward, a total coward.
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn’t have nerve enough to stand up for herself.
What can I do for you, madam?
Oh, on my soul, my cousin has been slandered falsely!
You’ve got it wrong, old man.
I’ll rest here.
Exactly.
Listen to me, good brother.
Read the will!
But whenever you feel a larger pain, the smaller one disappears.
Just as I told you, he usually sleeps in the afternoon.
If we meet again, then we’ll smile.
I’ll finish my lecture after dinner.
Mercutio, be quiet.
Yes, I was, but I don’t want an answer from you.
Let it end, or let me die so I won’t have to watch any more of it.
Yes, by God, that it is.
Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles.
Beware of jealousy, my lord!
I’ll deliver the message.
Is this the Prince’s brother?
You’re making such a fuss.
toward his own father who loves him so completely.
What, did you cheat on us before we deserved it?
Don’t worry about that.
Oh luck, luck.
I’m never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music.
I beg the court to deliver the verdict.
Open your gates.
I want my bond.
Don’t give it away.
That’s true.
The table’s full.
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath, and he’s coming to make his choice now.
Listen to our horses neighing, longing to be working.
What a storm!
Oh, that’s not true, my lord.
Please, sir, restrain yourself.
Take comfort.
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful.
For that kind of relief, the patient must heal herself.
Well, well, well.
Read it, Mark Antony.
Could you tell me how near the enemy is?
No, add a couple more syllables.
Are the others waiting?
To our house.
As for Monsieur Malvolio, let me take care of him.
You’ll live in luxury with Gremio.
The sister of my wife, this lady here, is married to your son.
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done?
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne, my wife, is very sick.
I’ve heard about this indirectly, but I will send for him.
Good night, good night.
Here, hang them on this clothesline.
What things, my lord?
I’ll bet anything you like that nothing will happen, once again.
Do you really mean that?
I nursed her daughter, whom you were just talking to.
Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep.
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you.
What is the name of the castle that stands over there?
He’s really taken this prank to heart.
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians, and you ignored my letters, where I argued that he was innocent; I know the man.
She blushes from guilt, not modesty.
I recognize your face perfectly, even without a sailor’s cap on your head.—Take him away.
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign.
It won’t annoy you like me, because it doesn’t have a voice.
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor?
Therefore the dukes of Berri, Bretagne, Brabant, and Orléans shall advance, and you, Prince Dauphin, will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves.
Here, sir!
Pharmacist!
You can hope your father isn’t your real father.
Leave Hermia alone.
I was afraid this would happen, because he was a noble, brave man, but I didn’t think he had a weapon.  
Run away, I beg you!
him terribly.
The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our course.
Here’s a drink.
Do you have anything else to tell me?
There, take it, and thanks for taking such good care of me.
Look, sir, I’m bleeding.
Will you wait awhile?
All right, then.
Tom will chase them off.—Go away, you mongrels!
But please, tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius.
That’s very soon.
I’d better stop up my ears against this siren’s song.
Oh, I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens!
She confessed.
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you, You’ll have a fool’s head forever.
That’s because you are near me, and you’re as dazzling as the sun.
Oh, you’re a clergyman?
He thinks highly of me.
Don’t.
Now, Signior Petruchio, how are you getting on with my daughter?
Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you!
I can’t say no.
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will.
That’s another bad deal I’ve made!—a bankrupt, a spendthrift, who now has to hide his head on the Rialto, a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants.
Are you laughing at what I say, as if I were a fool?
I bet my life on it.
Well she was, good Curtis, before this frost.
Stop, Sir Toby!
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen!
Hello, sir.
I’ll send my eyes to prison, and they’ll never be free to look at anything again.
Get up, man!
But ships are just fragile boards, and sailors are just men.
I can’t love him.
Come and get it!
Here is a friar who’s trembling, sighing and weeping.
Before I hear him, I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France.
That’s how you’ll talk about me when you’re in this mood.
It’s all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary.
They were paid to betray their master.
What can I say to him, lady?
I don’t understand.
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals.
Let me destroy myself, let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours, let day remain dark and night sleepless, and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart, clean devotion, and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter.
Why, what did he do?
She’s a good little woman, and she adores me.
That’s the one.
Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us.
Damned Iago!
But I need to remember I’m related to him by blood, not behavior.
What a wise judge!
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping.
Come with me; I’ll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me.
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis, and Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife where he was shipwrecked; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves.
Stop, for God’s sake!
With all of them at once: they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix.
Oh, liars can look so honest!
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor.
Go in, and don’t cry.
Did you send for him, sir?
We’re off, Biondello.
Can a man do it?
I had a son, whom I’ve legally disowned.
It’s about you.
Let’s go!
But what’s he like?
Is the king dead, the empire dispossessed?
I don’t know, madam.
I know he’s noble, rich, young, and with a fine reputation.
What, are we having a feast?
Now the time is right for us to speak, and we do so with imperial authority.
Cowards die many times before their deaths.
It’s a wild night.
I can tell that you don’t know who I am.
Antonio!
Here he is.
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it.
Here comes Sir Toby, limping.
Wake up, wake up, ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens.
Your highness, I want nothing more than what you’ve already offered.
Gentlemen, I don’t know what you intend to do, who else you intend to kill, who else you consider corrupt.
You’re sick, yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker?
Yes, Caesar, but it’s not gone yet.
He’s not brave enough to be wise.
The “passionate” duke?
I’m coming, I’m coming!
How are you, my golden girl?
An illicit kiss!
Don’t talk to me, because I won’t say a word.
No, you must see them as your father sees them.
Hide behind the boxwood hedge, all three of you.
We’ll have the wedding at the church tomorrow.
Even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than Macbeth.
My servants might overhear, and old Gremio is still hanging around, so we might be interrupted.
To hell with your sword.
But I wish I could say that’s the last time he’ll do it!
God will protect me.
Every glass of liquor is damned, and the devil’s the main ingredient!
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking, Edmund.
All right then.
Oh, you’re a naughty one, encouraging double-dealing.
Come, Romeo.
I’ll break my spells and bring them back to their senses, and they’ll feel like themselves again.
Oh, my heart!
I’m very sorry you’re not feeling well.  
That’s what he said.
The poor thing, he is so shaken with a fever that it’s terrible to see.
If you won’t leave, then 
Swear your love for each other.
Is he there in person?
I know that my hour has come.
Why, what’s the problem?
I see a voice!
My lord, I’d want to have the gift you promised me on your honor: the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it.
No, I don’t.
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast.
Driven?” Really?
No, my good knight.
Everything is a sick joke.
And does she have to die for this?
Do as I asked you.
You’re a pustule, a sore, a tumor digesting my bloodline.
Go, but sign the deed.
How are you, Lorenzo?
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive.
I’ll say good-bye now.
If they have done this thing, my noble lord— If?
I won’t take it.
Is it them?
Do I speak to you kindly?
He’s lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them.
If I break the door down, slave, you’ll be sorry for this.
My master said it.
Merciful heaven!
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me.
And mine say a hundred and forty.
I wish I were, so I could deprive you of both day and life.
Let me see them.
Answer me that first.
I’m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me.
My Lord of Warwick, a most corrupt treason—God be praised for it!—has been discovered, as plain as any you’d hope to see on a summer’s day.
I have money in my purse and property at home, so I’m off to see the world.
Lord Hastings, you and he are close.
Yeah, right, go get him.
He’s subhuman, like an animal.
So you had time as you were dying to look around?
He’s an unremarkable man, fit only to be sent on errands.
Yes, it’s true.
Your grief should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would never end.
Choose your revenge.
You’re doing the right thing.
You’re talking about killing?
Show your slaves how mad you are, and make your servants tremble.
If she’d been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her.
Then lead the way, father.
Bassanio, we’ll say goodbye for now, since you’ve found Antonio.
Fool, do not flatter yourself.
Do you know me?
Let’s act quickly.
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world, encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home, where there’s little to be found in the way of experience.
Good Ursula, go wake my cousin and ask her to get up.
Send your man away.
Well, to wear out their shoes and get myself more work.
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields, and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep.
Who are you?
Would I dare do something like that?
How’s it going?
He’ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more.
This was the most unkind cut of all.
What a wonderful time to be alive!
I’d hate to waste my speech on the wrong person, because It’s very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it.
How does she claim to own you?
What’s the matter with you?
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty.
You’re lying.
The wolves have finished preying for the night, and look—the gentle dawn is rising, dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light.
I’ve stayed up all night many times before for less important matters, and I’ve never gotten sick.
Those are her orders.
Very true.
Has it come to this?
Goodbye, Helena.
Well, let’s watch it.
Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as you”?
Take Cupid’s wings and fly higher than the average man.
I wish it were over.
I know how they think, and I understand why they’re doing this.
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy.
If she admits she wanted this, then I won’t blame Othello.—Come here, my child.
How is my noble lord?
A very candid reply.
My sweet Cassio!
I’ll send a man to Mantua, where that exiled rogue is living.
But when exactly will we see Benedick married?
What’s going on, my love?
But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts.
You seem to be a good person, captain, and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside, I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners.
Do not run away.
It’s not in the contract.
I see that you are here, but I’d like you to go there and then come back again.
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming.
Come, I’ll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns.
Good friends, I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient, sweet, virtuous wife.
Most mighty Caesar, give me some reason, so I won’t be laughed at when I tell them so.
Yes, and he’ll keep getting funnier till he dies.
It’s impossible.
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill.
I can’t make up for everything that I’d like to, so accept such kindness as I can offer.
You have ruined my innocent child.
Mustardseed.
I know you have no choice.
Indeed, they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old.
Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart.
Listen to the noble Antony.
Pardon us, dear father.
I’ll go put my armor on.
You’ll be sorry later, but it’ll be too late. 
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep.
Go, coward that you are.
Now I go, a jolly, thriving wooer, to marry my brother Edward’s young daughter, Elizabeth, because I know Richmond has his eye on her.
Orsino, this is the same Antonio who took the 
Now, I swear by Apollo… By Apollo, King, you’re taking the names of the gods in vain.
They’re speaking to him.
They’re just fine, my dear madam.
Shall I come down?
But where is Kate?
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard.
My fears can’t actually make you evil.
How is it that you’ve come back so soon?
To be honest, I don’t know why I’m so sad.
This precious little guy is putty in your hands, Sir Toby.
This means I’ve mistreated Edgar.
Please, young man, don’t make me angry.
You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter?
Captain Macmorris, I beg your pardon, but would you grant me a discussion or two with you, see, partly touching on or concerning the practice of war, the Roman wars, for the sake of argument, see, and friendly conversation?
It’s his fault that he’s all worked up like this.
In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant?
Then meet me right away at the notary’s.
Wait, good Beatrice.
You’re like one of those guys who walks into a bar, slams his sword on the table, and then says, “I pray I never have to use you.” By the time he orders his second drink, he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all.
It’s Mercutio’s relative, noble Count Paris!
Where’s the necklace?
It’s nothing.
I met the young man at Lawrence’s cell.
You won’t leave this grove until I’ve paid you back for this insult.
Madam, not yet.
Fate, do your work.
And when she is peevish and perverse, sullen, sour, and disobedient to his honest wishes, what is she but a loathsome, warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord?
No, please good Meg, I’ll wear this one.
I wish he’d go away!
Order him to advance his forces first thing, and we’ll follow.
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him.
And what an excellent piece of work it is, too, madam lady!
The most beautiful queen they ever had.
But what can be done to prevent it?
I don’t think he’d have any choice, my lord.
If you ever had a mother, come in quickly to Sir John.
I’ll help out, if only because he speaks the same language as me.
Conspiracies, fakery, betrayal, and disorder are all that’s left until we die.
When this wood burns, it’ll weep for making you tired.
How will that kill this marriage?
I’ve seen her do it.
If you’re as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you, this will definitely come to a happy end.
Also, you’re supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who’s drunk to go home and go to bed.
What do the priests say?
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout, waiting to capture me.
Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a freakshow, just like they do with deformed animals.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention.
I can only say this about her: if she looked different than she does, she would be ugly, and since she can’t be anything but herself, I don’t like her.
Oh noble lord, consider your lineage.
So think carefully about what you want, beautiful Hermia.
I do, Mark Antony.
And now you’re asking for money.
Hey, if I lay down my “ Welcome, Lorenzo and Salerio.
I’m glad to see you.
I’m going to get my  Please, listen to me.
In his heart?
Yours, Claudio, yours, I say.
Yes, he is dead.
Listen!
And he doesn’t let go of his target when a distraction appears.
Please do.
We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house, and he’ll say that you’re sick today.
It’s better to act virtuously rather than vengefully.
Go where, my lord?—Cesario, my husband, stay here.
Where did he get wine?
Hey, if I’d remembered something about him, I could have had a good comeback for my uncle, touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine.
He is worth no more than that.
It’s his wife, Lady Grey, who got him to do this.
I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest.
Don’t misunderstand me, sir.
How dare you tell us about God’s laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself?
You’ve won.
Let the ship sail close to the wind.
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood.
A man who’s robbed, but doesn’t miss what’s stolen, isn’t robbed at all.
Antonio and Shylock, both of you come forward.
May God, who is the best matchmaker, join your hearts and realms in one.
I’d like to munch on some good dry oats.
You think I care what I’m called?
What an idiot this guy is!—You’re a rotten piece of work!—I beg your highness, beat him up and take his wine bottle from him.
The other day I saw him defeated in a
I tried to play games with God, and he turned my fake prayer on my head, giving me for real what I’d asked for as a joke.
I’ve written to my sister telling her everything he’s said.
My wickedness?
We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us.
Monstrous!
Let’s go up to the castle.
She’s so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician.
Neither would I.
Or stole it, rather.
He thinks “G” is me.
And so do I, my lord.
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself.
Bathe his filthy head with warm, scented water.
This haunting business is even stranger than murder.
Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read?
Here he is, here he is.
I’ll do any decent thing, my lord, to help my cousin get a good husband.
That’s merciful but a bit careless.
The British forces are on their way here.
Our business now is mourning and grief. 
Ha!
But surely you’re not planning to 
I’ll tell everyone what you did, even if it
Brutus speaks.
Oh, it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this, things that I can’t remember.
Look, how she blushes like a virgin!
Then both, or one, or anything you like.
And even though you know I’m very close to the Prince and Claudio, I swear I’ll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly.
If I find an opportunity, I will give him a piece of my mind.
Will you have dinner with me tonight, Casca?
I don’t know what to say.  
Listen!
I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise.
He’ll be a good governor.
Don’t worry about me not swearing enough.
Do you understand what I’m saying, man?
He’s laughing already!
Oh, what misery!
Is he losing his mind?
So confess your sin freely now.
I swear by the mass, before I close my eyes to go to sleep, I’ll put in some good fighting, or I’ll lie in the ground dead.
The bridegroom is already here.
Think about that, and about what followed afterward.
Halfway down the cliff there’s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs—a risky business!
For it is written in the book of Numbers: “When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, claim what is yours.
Excuse me, weren’t you with Countess Olivia just now?
Yes.
In exchange, give up your claim to love Helena, since I love her and will love her until I die.
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me, kick me—even kill me.
God give you joy, Petruchio.
And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play.
No, I don’t, my lord.
When they choose, they only know how to lose.
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of.
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him.
It’s the truth.
That’s true, it’s your beauty’s fault.
Right on time.
Tell me.
It’ll go away.
I found this pinned to my tent this morning.  
Exactly, madam, until I sleep with you.
I only partly believe it, for I’m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering.
Sorry, sir, Goodman Verges tends to ramble.
What?
I’ll go to lunch.
Hear me out, my lord.
It did, it did.
Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach.
You are, but you don’t know it yet.
Please, Signior Gremio.
You expect me to cry?
Hey!
I’m to blame for making you wait for me.
Time’s not the one in debt.
Little birds do it, and dragonflies copulate right in front of me.
But it’d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible.
A mischievous child.
I’ll catch it before it falls to the ground.
Well, I hope not.
The brilliant Sir Topas!
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface.
Oh, she could sing a wild bear to sleep!
Mighty duke, please allow me to say something.
Who’s calling me?
As for your coming in to dinner, just do what you feel is right.
Good Lord!
What’s that?
Set down your honorable load, men, if there is ever any honor in being dead.
He didn’t say anything, he’s reading.
Well, I wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness, since the boy turned out so well.
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards.
I want to stay more than I want to go.
You are welcome for his sake.
Yes, it’s true, sir.
I’m done for in this world, I believe.
Then you’re a better man than the king.
Get him, he’s a thief!
Stop right there, sir.
I’m afraid he’ll punish me.
I will, sir.
Roderigo!
I brought you here from Venice.
What a fearful night this is!
What a fine sight!
What’s the matter, lieutenant?
First let’s go to dinner.
I’ll bring you there.
Here, sir, as foolish as ever.
He was not born to be shameful.
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands, and great warriors aren’t  Ha, ha!
I don’t wish that on you.
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help?
This is Illyria, lady.
He’s having a fit and talking nonsense.
What a tedious wait!
The ship was already sailing.
Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome.
Ah-ha!
Because Pyramus is a good-looking man, the most handsome man that you could find on a summer’s day, a lovely gentlemanly man.
Who’s there?
Are you all crazy?
Let’s go to this great feast.
Come.
This box is too threatening.
I think if we had fought, we would have proven too young and strong for them after all.
And, in fact, I think they’re meeting together right now.
It’s not yet daylight.
Get down and swear it.
No, I don’t know you, and my lady didn’t send me to get you, and I’m not supposed to tell you to come speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this is not my nose, either.
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart.
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god of war?
That’s the end of the announcement.
Quiet, children, quiet.
So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say.
Where is my lord, the duke of Gloucester?
Oh, one child is one too many!
I came here with a fool’s head on my shoulders and now I’m leaving with two.—Goodbye, sweet lady.
That man always looks so sour!
We understand you’re just doing it for us, and we’ll be sure to say so.
I thank you for that quip, good Tranio.
Tell me, is it missing?
By my sword, Beatrice, you love me.
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place, the heavens will not bless your relationship, but will overwhelm you with hate, contempt, and discord, and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it.
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance.
The silk came from sacred silkworms, and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts.
Why are you so far from home?
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you.
Goodbye.
Now, no more questions.
I can’t believe I was scared of him!
I have already.
Let me be put to death.
Who pleaded with me to pardon 
The Phoenix is my house?
Beware of March 15th.
You have a fat friend at your master’s house: she took care of me in the kitchen today, thinking I was you.
Roderigo’s been killed?
But I won’t leave this spot, no matter what they do.
We’ll see about that!
It’s the blessed sun.
Catesby, fly to the duke.
Romeo must die.
Iago.
When we were alone, we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant.
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife.
Shake off sleep, which looks like death, and look at death itself!
Oh, let her live, and I’ll ruin her manners and her beauty.
I’m a man, my lady, that God has made for himself to ruin.
Within an hour, one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder.
And why, wise lady?
Who treated you badly?
You’re not leaving the house today.
I saw it in the orchard.
Evil spirit, I want to talk some more.
Run, master, run.
Tell them to capture me, then sell my bones.
Often I have heard of “sanctuary men,” but until now I’ve never heard of “sanctuary children.” My lord, you’ve won me over this time.
You were one of his favorites.
Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt dead too?
How did he try to persuade you to love him?
I will.
Don’t stay to answer me—get going.
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne.
I will, my lord.
No, afterward.
She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that.
Come on, you.
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious.
We’ll have one heart, one bed, two bodies, and one faithful vow.
I know that she is worthy of that love.
Yes, just as great and just as recent.
Oh great, here come the Capulets.
Goodbye.
Then patiently listen to my impatience.
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck.
Shame on you!
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight.
You can decide that privately.
Is Scotland the same as when I left it?
Then have your servants bring him out.
I can read.
There are enemies here.
Therefore, I beg your Highness, pardon me.
The ground is brown.
I’ll do so.
They will tell me more, because I’m determined to know the worst about what’s going to happen.
Ha, ha, ha!
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.
I’m happy about that.
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage.
What’s happening to me, that I’m frightened of every noise?
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message.
It’s good you found me.
Not much.
And then Pyramus showed up.
We’ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke’s forest.
My lord, when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter.
What’s going on here?
But you must learn to recognize such liars, or you will be greatly taken advantage of.
Dear Mr. Fabian, do me another favor first.
I won’t mess with him.
Here comes the little villain herself.
Did you leave on good terms?
But you can’t see where you’re going, sir.
Or are you low, vulgar, and of the common people?
If he seems game to our plan, encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons.
But let it rain; I’ll survive.
Your daughter and son-in-law.
A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but different ones from what we heard and saw.
Come sit on me.
You see how naïve and foolish I’ve been.
To celebrate a marriage of true love, and give a gift to the lovers.
Some people in the street are crying “Romeo.” Some are crying “Juliet,” and some are crying “Paris.” They’re all running in an open riot toward our tomb.
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title—in French,  And even this I’m willing to grant if you request it.
God and your work be praised, victorious friends.
I am at your service.
Just look at me kindly, and I’m invincible against their hatred.
Amen to that, Gonzalo.
Which one will start yammering first, Gonzalo or Adrian?
He really is the most skillful, bloodthirsty, and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria.
Last night she got no sleep, and she won’t get any tonight.
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king’s two sons, have run away and fled, which makes them the prime suspects.
I don’t owe her any duty—it’s you that I submit to.
I’m about to fly away.
Honestly, sir, I’d need to use words to explain why, and since words are so unreliable and false, I’d rather avoid using them in a serious discussion.
Show.
My enemies help me understand myself better, which is an advantage, and my friends help me lie about myself, which is a disadvantage.
Bring them to me.
There’s my dagger  Put away your dagger.
For some reason he’s in prison now on some legal technicality, on Malvolio’s orders.
I can see in your eyes that you’re starving.
It’s nothing, my lord.
Come here, good Volumnius.
I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio.
You’ll find I’ll give it to you very willingly.
Does everyone kill what they don’t love?
Good point, Decius.
And no doubt he is, gracious madam.
Yes, but I didn’t see anything wrong, and I heard every syllable they said.
But I don’t get it—what’s the joke?
Isn’t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it?
Please, go away.
Leah gave it to me before we were married.
I’m beginning to understand what you want me to do.
Oh heavens!
Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright!
What has the governor of the town decided?
Wait, don’t rush!
Answer all of us, now.
Come, come.
I saw the handkerchief.
The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky.
I wish there was less social pressure to drink.
Well, it must have been Signior Benedick.
I have sent for the strawberries.
Oh, Tranio, what a cruel father he is.
Then I’ll be quick.
Put on your nightgown, in case someone comes and sees that we’re awake.
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions.
Oh, no!
You think I’m kidding.
May God reward you for your kindness!
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth.
I wish they had stayed!
His name is Balthazar.
I ate with him and my sister.
Can’t you find a reason without my giving you one?
In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change.
This disease is beyond my medical skills.
Where is he?
Honest to God, where’s the sexton?
Brutus, my lord.
What about it?
Talk to him.
The best plays are still only illusions, and the worst are just as good, if you just use your imagination to fill them in.
But you have all the advantages from the harm done.
But I’ll see you soon.
And to you, most noble Caesar.
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight.
That’s the beginning of the day we see, but I don’t think we’ll see the end of it.—Who goes there?
If she refuses my proposal, I’ll tell her how much I’m looking forward to the announcement and the wedding.
And her sister’s dead too, poisoned by your wife.
I will see you tomorrow, then.
You’re in trouble either way.
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message?
Didn’t you tell me that I’d be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing?
That will happen before sunset.
But this is bad!
Hit them!
He tried to kill me recently, very recently.
If she offers him her love, it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it, since, as we all know, he tends to be contemptuous.
Is your name Goneril?
Now, Brutus, you have only yourself to thank.
When you’ve finished, go back to Pompey’s theater.
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome.
The general should be informed about this.
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage.
Well then, I’ll do it.
But I surrender all this magic now, when I’ve summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell, as I’m doing now, I’ll break my staff and bury it far underground, and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank.
What, even you, Brutus?
Sir, I must get that diamond ring back from you.
I’ll tell them where you come from, though I don’t know who you are or what you want.
I hope he is, but mothers get to have their doubts.
It’s your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins.
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums?
Amen to that, lady.
You must be mistaking me for someone else, sir.
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions.
Oh, young and noble Cato, have you been slain?
You and I, and honest Casca, we have epilepsy—we’ve fallen.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, and you, Sir Walter Herbert, are going to stay with me.
She’s talking.
Why are you treating my sister like this?
I’m telling you, it was Carthage.
Where is he?
Okay, so that’s when he’ll say we stabbed him in his sleep.
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights, squires, and brave gentlemen, five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday.
Killing men in the dark?
Where is that moron of a cook?
What do you think about him, Cassio?
Katherina, you may stay.
Wife!
Bring in more wine!              
She’s mine, and I’m giving her to Demetrius.  
Stop!
Which one of you is Beatrice?
Tell me what you’ve done with the money I entrusted to you.
I’m telling you this story for a reason.
So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat.
I won’t answer that.
Good night, good night.
What do you mean by that?
They’re very anxious for you to get there.
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them, separating our nobles from the common men, for many of our princes—alas!—lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers.
I thought you were resolved to do this.
How can we tell which of us is the oldest?
Stars, my lord.
I sincerely hope it does you good, mangy rascal.
I don’t care if you love me or not, I like the cap and I’ll have it or I won’t have any.
What are you accused of?
When I raise my hand, you do the same, and bring it down on Gonzalo’s head.
We’re not getting any younger.
My vision is dull.
Go and wiggle your ears!
So that means she’ll come.
Is there any news about my husband?
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go.
By God, I will tell the king about these taunts.
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time?
That’s it?
Two hundred ducats.
What do you say?
That’s a nice hand you dealt me.
Come over here.
Welcome.
Does that mean he’s lazy?
Anyone who says you’re a man must not notice how young you are.
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair.
Absolutely—so long as he gets the girl.
No we’re not—it’s night.
How can this be?
Have they come back?
I love you dearly, Ariel.
What’s the matter?
Tom’s chilly.
Oh, are you really!
How can it be?
We are responsible for this. 
Has he asked for me?
Well then, goodbye.
A fortunate coincidence—more fortunate for your son.
Oh Cassius, I’m tired out by many sorrows.
Beatrice— I swear, I’m going.
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak.
Oh, Lord, if they were married, they’d drive themselves crazy within a week.
Thank you, Ariel.
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt.
That’s a good one.
Well, brighter lights always dim the smaller ones.
Go then, slave.
Prove you are worthy of your birth, which I do not doubt for a moment.
There you go.
Though our lives—   We have decided, my lord.
I don’t know.
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice.
Signor Antonio?
The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb.
God forbid!
This one, and I will give her to you.
Where do you come from, sir?
He still hasn’t told us about the captain.
Where’s Cesario going?
I’ll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf.
We are men, my lord.
I might as well go before the King of France, who took my youngest daughter without a dowry, kneel before his throne, and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive.
We cannot fight for love as men can.
Oh, don’t touch me.
Please, tell me more.
He is called Ensign Pistol.
The only possibility is that you’ve murdered him.
How did you sleep, my lord?
Why don’t you have a seat, your highness?
Please be quiet.
You mean you don’t even want to hear my side?
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and your words.
Curse you for your false appearances!
Calphurnia’s face is pale, and Cicero’s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol.
Oh, I wish I could make a  My soul is calling out my name.
Are they likely to get dusty?
As for his thoughts, I wish he’d think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time.
Do you think you’ve won?
I’ll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you.
What stunning, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty—but please, tell me if you’re the lady of the house, because I’ve never seen her.
I’ll bring you to him.
My uncle Clarence’s angry ghost.
I didn’t kill Lysander.
You talk like a child, but you’re very smart anyway.
Please get him, my friend, I beg you.
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?
Yes, she saw me quite clearly.
It has hatched a    I go unwillingly.
I’m afraid it will  I’d love it.
Maybe you should ask, what will you do for a husband?
I’m not talking with you.
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections.
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time.
A snake did do it, because no snake ever had a more forked, lying tongue than you have.
She’s gone forever.
With a doctor’s help he might recover and become an ass again.
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier?
You mean this is the whole problem, that she is shy and hasn’t said everything she means to say and do?—My lord of Burgundy, what do you have to say to this lady?
No, let them go.
My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me.
Bring down that top sail!
But was this near the shore?
What do you get to drink, instead of sweet obedience, but poisonous flattery?
But I paid attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell.
That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday.
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.
It will be made even heavier soon—by the weight of a man.
Arms, make your last embrace!
I swear by my sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth.
I say it’s the moon.
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended.
I’ll take it over to the pile.
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him, and get him back to Naples, he’d make a great present for any emperor.
You do the same.
Don’t disturb his soul.
Madam, tell me quickly, what day is that?
It looks great.
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost.
You’ve said it well.
He’s busy, can’t you hear him giving orders?
As far as I know, sir.
What about that?
It’s a good thing I’m like a little pot and warm up quickly, or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and my heart would freeze in my belly, before I managed to get thawed out.
It’s his handwriting, my lord, but I hope he didn’t mean what he wrote.
I’d rather have my horse than a mistress.
I’ll do that.
All the spirits hate him as much as I do.
And why are you so pale?
I don’t think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning.
Name him.
Your answer?
You force me to read the will, then?
By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk.
Give me your hand.
Oh, here comes the storm again.
The work we enjoy is not really work.
Hunt them down.
Absolutely—he is stuffed, like a dummy.
If you really feel that way, then I hope you won’t kill me.
You’d be a pitiful bird.
My heart adores him, even though my tongue curses him.
Well, we’ll see how you act.
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning.
Tell him that the mayor, some citizens, and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good.
What’s up, mister?
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now.—You know your job, brother.
My father, led by a poor peasant?
That’s not what I wish.
That’s the curse of military service.
Fight to the death” is his motto.
A friend would never see those faults.
Tell her that I’ve been arrested and the money will be my bail.
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage, I order you on your souls to say so.
Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re having a hard time getting up now?
Get out of my sight!—I guess if she doesn’t love her father, then I’ll only have peace when I’m dead.—Call the King of France.
If he doesn’t show up, the play is ruined.
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste.
So please listen to me.
Here, I’ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage, which is waiting for us at the gate.
I am their aunt, and I love them like a mother.
Oh!
Your words are idiotic.
Oh, poor Romeo!
No, it’s a story.
You’ll know more about it later.
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey.
I know him.
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on.
If a Jew offends a Christian, what’s the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction?
No, if you struggle with me— Just half an hour!
My God, what a great song!
She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me.
He talks nothing but nonsense.
For instance, our husbands
You know what I intend.
Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult.
Tell me what it’s about.
Oh, father, I’m taking care of your business.
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape.
I like you very much.
Please stay below deck, sir.
By God, I’m going to tell the duke how slack you’ve been.
Why don’t you go off to church dancing one way, and come home dancing another way?
And what of all this?
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman.
Leave me alone.
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that much.
You stopped me.
I can help you find a wife who’s rich, young, beautiful, and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman.
He looks calmer than he did before.
If we are slated to die, the fewer, the better for our country, and if we’re slated to live, the fewer men, the greater the share of honor for each of us.
Remember March, March 15th.
I don’t trust you.
This bad weather isn’t good to walk around in.
You’ve made up your mind, then?
In fact, I’d do even more to him than what you’ve heard him promise to do.
I wonder why Cambio hasn’t shown up in all this time.
Losers always leave quickly.
What if I had a rat in my house, and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated?
As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest.
Where’s the cook?
I don’t know him.
I am satisfied, as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her.
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet.
Oh, how awful!
Now he’s telling the story.
Whenever they meet, there’s a little battle.
He did, my lord.
I will my lord, as fast as I can.
Error in the bill, sir, error in the bill!
What are you going to do now?
It’s not safe to go near them till we get more help.
No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going.
There’s no doubt that Petruchio’s got quite a catch.
We have slashed the snake but not killed it.
Well, the point is, he’s lost a ship.
Well, enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep.
Arrest him: he’s a friend of the duke of Alençon’s.
And be a happy mother by doing so.
If there is, then heaven help him!
Is that a lot of      He says his name is Master Fer.
Not one, my lord.
Well, I’ll get my revenge.
No, leave him alone.
But for your private satisfaction, because I love you, I’ll tell you.
Madam, I’d better leave now.
I swear, she’s a very good-natured lady.
Time, you thwart my dreadful plans.
Get going already.
That will be a good thing.
Don’t worry about the cost.
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
Oh, what a sad sight!
Birnam Wood.
You’re better off because of your friends.
I have to do it, I have to do it.
My dear Regan, your sister’s not worth anything.
Don’t trust Trebonius.
Why, friends, you don’t even know what you’re doing yet.
But I’m afraid we’ll never get him to agree to be king.
I serve the king, who sent me here.
He should swear by his two-faced self, and that’s an oath I’ll believe!
Do you lie so low?
Now that I’m done, Wall can go away.
Go!
What does he say about our marriage?
But as I said, the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now.
So do you take her or leave her?
I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be lying.
Well, let it strike ten then.
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest.
Tie him up harder.—You filthy traitor!
Goodbye.
Here comes the Duke now.
There wasn’t any problem.
Are you insane?
It is a trade, sir, that I practice with a clear conscience.
I hope your Majesty will, in all good conscience, bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alençon and that your Majesty gave it to me.
Decius Brutus doesn’t love you.
Can he even get angry?
Let everyone beware: I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose.
The duke’s trumpets.
You’re so much older than you look!
I have an aunt who is a widow, who’s very rich and doesn’t have any children.
Scum!
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.
Oh, it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets, taking their scent with it.
Teach me to forget to think!
Lysander and I are running away from here.
It’s the best thing to do.
What was your dream?
No, villain, but you didn’t work alone.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I hired to perform the butchery, are used to killing people, the bloody dogs.
Aren’t you dead yet?
Lucentio’s son is older than that, sir.
Now I’m scared again.
I know how  Too light for a lout like you to catch—though no lighter than I should be.
Which of you two ate lunch with me today?
The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal.
Is this possible, my lord?
A man, like you.
So what?
Shame on you, warped hag!
I feel awful for my cousin.
I’m not asking you to call her.
Richard of York, how are you doing, my loving brother?
You’re the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned.
You had rotten food, and he helped you eat it.
What did he do to you?
Something about Cyprus.
If it is, I suggest you don’t eat it.
They were villains, murderers.
Good morning to you both.
Please call him and tell him to come back here.
Your husband knew about everything.
It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart.
Prepare your troops.
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard.
Oh, this is treachery!
It’s always better to get rid of what you’re scared of than to be afraid.
Well, it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly, too dark to be praised fairly, and too small to be praised greatly.
My God, it’s nauseating!
He’s out of his right mind.
Take good care of him.
If he hears you, you’ll make him angry.
Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom.
Is it good or bad?
Talk makes him crazy.
He’s a devil, a born devil, who can never be trained.
Say, isn’t this the Latin master Cambio?
He is the prince of horses.
As I said before, Antonio will guarantee the loan.
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man.
Messala, I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power.
Take him away!
Come to my room later on.
Yes, that the king is dead.
She was only dead, my lord, as long as her slander lived.
If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to England.
Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia!
You should know I’ve earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John.
I don’t like that.
Sebastian was my father’s name, and my brother was named Sebastian too.
Is it possible?
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond.
I’m starting to lose my mind.
Goneril, are you coming with us?
Can your man keep a secret?
How will you wreck this marriage?
Listening to their frightened voices, I couldn’t reply “Amen” when they said “God bless us!” Don’t think about it so much.
Who has wronged him?
Just a man, like any other.
Oh, what a sad day!
Your children caused you trouble in your youth, but mine will bring you comfort in your old age.
I think you’re all either bewildered or stark raving mad.
Did you see the weird sisters?
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house.
Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable we’re only workaday soldiers.
Have you not spoken to her since then?
What, an argument already?
He once said the devil would get him because of women.
Othello, I’ve been seriously hurt.
You’re on very good terms with the duke of Exeter.
This choice was as foolish as they are.
I don’t have any “brilliant” reason for it, but I have a good enough reason.
Are you a god, an angel, or a devil, that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up?
An honest guy who’s as poor as the king.
But they aren’t.
There’s your boyfriend, sleeping right over there.
God, I’m crazy about her.
Yes, my good lord.
I accept that offer happily, madam.
Then let the rain come down.
I suspect his friends will join us.
How late is it, lords?
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet?
Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I’ll pass out.
She’s alive.
God, what a burden on you I must have been!
I was sent for a rope!
Nathaniel’s coat was being fixed, sir.
And a bad singer, my lord.
Look at this, here is the man—scarred, as you can see, by traitors. 
Bring me some light, gentlemen, I’ll bind the wound with my shirt.
I’m not here.
lain.
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king.
I am, unless I somehow stole this role.
That’s out of tune, sir.
Give me the gown.
He ran to his house, stunned.
What do you mean, “wears the wreath”?
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed ass’s head off of the head of that Athenian man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do, they can all go back to Athens.
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you, my noble knight, what do you think?
It’s torture, not mercy.
There were enough Christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other.
Take me off to jail?
I tricked your own eyes.
Well, it doesn’t matter anymore.
Please don’t make fun of me.
Otherwise I would have been perfect, as solid as a piece of marble, as firm as a rock, as free as the air itself.
What can you swear by now?
Easy, Petruchio.
Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says.
Come, night.
Oh, that’s pathetic!
It’s almost five o'clock.
So be calm.
Can a good thing hide itself?
Go to my brother Cassius.
Cure her of that.
Oh, Lord!
He’s evaded love once or twice, and since then Cupid doesn’t dare to shoot at him.
When you fight against your country’s enemies, you will be paid for your efforts with your country’s wealth.
It is not nighttime now.
From down here, I thought his eyes looked like full moons.
You’re wise!
The question is, how would being king change him?
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn’t know that our situation was secure?
Come on, come on.
Why, may I ask?
His counselors will govern as long as he’s a minor, and then he’ll take over.
An Englishman?
Here I am.
And before I make her normal again—I can cure her by treating her with another plant—I’ll make her give me that little boy as my page.
What’s going on these days?
Shut up, fool!
Make it eight and eight.
And as for what I promised to you, I’m as good as my word.
He’s hiding out in Friar Lawrence’s cell.
Hang out?” Who do you think we are, musicians in a band?
Come, sisters, let’s cheer him up and show him our talents.
Give me your hand.
My name’s Macbeth.
Are you planning to go out?
Good lord!
The world is a bad place, where you can’t speak what you know.
Who did this, Sir Andrew?
Come on, Nerissa, I want to go see this man who’s come so courteously.
Sir, welcome to our house.
Now I’ll believe that unicorns exist, and that there’s a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives.
Favorably, except that there wasn’t enough time for his Grace to hear, as I sensed he would have liked to, the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France, and to the throne of France in general, through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather, Edward III.
piece of cheese will get him.—I challenge you to a match.
No, come back, Kate.
Why, what symptoms of love does she exhibit?  
That our clothes were drenched with sea water, but they came out looking brand-new.
I’m sweating and trembling with fear.
I’ll use it for fish bait.
In its tail.
Frightening looks are also at my service, as are fake smiles.
Poor Harry of England!
What an awful day!
I have lived long enough.
I’d rather break my own heart.
We’ll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors' houses on fire.
I took their stings too, wouldn’t you say?
Mark Antony, should we give the signal to attack?
Well, you have given me great comfort.
The king of England’s approach is as forceful as a whirlpool.
The Prince has made the match, and may God bless it.
We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars.
You good-for-nothing, let me in.
I won’t say anything negative about what he might be.
It isn’t daybreak yet.
What Tranio did, he did at my command.
Now let the wind blow, waves swell, and ships sink!
This is as bad as the tortures of hell.
Can you ask around and find out?
Why are you curious, Iago?
Scorn and defiance, indifference, contempt, and any insult that wouldn’t disgrace the mighty sender—that’s the value he puts on you.
But tell me—which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me?
Peaseblossom.
Listen to Antony.
you, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago.
Oh my God, what a terrible world this is!
The army is ready.
Nothing, but this is true.
Hurry, go up to the roof.
Here’s the east.
They’re louder than the storm or us sailors.
It’s too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection!
My first question for Nerissa is whether she’d rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now, since there are only two more hours till morning.
Caliban, who now serves me.
You’ll be ashamed of this forever!
You’d better knock louder.
I never offended him at all.
Good.
Your Juliet is alive.
Our regiments are full to the brim; our cause is ready.
Very impressive.
Your face betrays strange feelings, my lord, and people will be able to read it like a book.
Spirit, did you carry out the storm just as I ordered?
My lord, I don’t know what’s going on, but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before.
Oh, I could weep my soul right out of myself!
But in spite of all this, the man is still wealthy enough.
I’ll tell you: it’s because of a law as plain as Father Time’s bald head.
Why?
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now.
person when you’re ready, if you’re inclined.
What’s that?
I have nothing to do with what you’re talking about, my lord.
When the poor cried, Caesar cried too.
But I promise you, Kate: the older I grow the better I’ll look.
I’m afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith.
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter.
If I gave them all I own, I’d have two fool’s caps for myself.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, unfit for toil and trouble in the world, if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts?
I wish she were in her coffin here, with the ducats in her coffin!
Good, good, I like that—it’s only fair!
Anything I did to you, I did it because Sir Toby made me.
And as for his dreams, I’m surprised he’s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night.
I don’t know how to ask you for forgiveness, but I have to say something.
I’m full of joy.
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon.
What, like stuff from a house?
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me.
The hell with order!
In suicide, gods allow tyrants to be defeated.
You’d better shut up!
I myself am the King of Naples, since I saw with my own eyes—these eyes that haven’t been dry since—my father killed in a shipwreck.
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war, since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot.
And my heart too.
Every month he has a new best friend.
I don’t even know you.
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince, your great-uncle, who fought a tragic battle on French soil, routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop, smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen.
Yet you killed my children.
Are you going to take care of this thing now?
Signior Benedick!
Catesby.
It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting.
So I’ll stay here for a while.
Fabian can hardly control him over there.
Edmund, go find him.
Sister, let’s eat and stop worrying.
Am I to be dictated to, like a child?
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly.
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto.
Peter Quince— What is it, jolly Bottom?
That’s a good point.
Let me tell
You’ll take the mustard or you’ll get no beef from Grumio.
But here come some people, right in the nick of time.  
Heaven knows.
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.
Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look.
When I talked about all these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively.
He speaks well.
And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor Antonio.
What are you going to do for a father?
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave.
The best way to be happy is to be in between.
I’m making a kind offer—zero percent financing.
But please, father—the question is still nagging at me—why did you conjure up this storm?
You’re  Forgive me, Signior Gremio, but I’m anxious to get things moving.
If the English had any sense, they would run away.
You’re brave gentlemen.
Farewell.
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome.
Seriously, I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa, when we attended the marriage of the king’s daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
You’re in love?
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat?
Hey, Brabantio!
Come on, do you think I can’t recognize you by your excellent wit?
Have Montjoy hurry, then, Lord Constable, and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war.
No?
Take his sword away from him.
I think you are.
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I have offended.
Listen to me, Beatrice— Talking with a man outside her bedroom window!
The will!
Your wife wouldn’t like it if she were here to hear you make that offer.
No, I’ll recite it for you right now: “de hand, de fangres, de nails—” “De nails,” madame.
But where will I lie tomorrow?
No, nor could the devil’s name be more frightening.
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa— What, what, what?
When?
And what is this useless ceremony of kings?
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew, speak up, please.
It took me two years before I had a single tooth.
Will you listen to me, Roderigo?
But when  You take up your duties too cheerfully.
I’ll do what I can, more than I’d do for myself.
You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed.
I was reminded of my son, even though I despised my son at that time.
My master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you don’t belong to the house of Montague, please come and drink a cup of wine.
Six pence a day would’ve been forced on him.
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise, I guess.
I don’t trust you.
Then leave him out.
That’s what you’ll say once you’ve seen part two.
Cicero is dead, by their decree.
Welcome, my lord.
Don’t talk back to me.
Take my remark in whichever sense you like.
I’ll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does, despite his youth and manliness.
She had no food today and will have none.
Ah, how will this all turn out?
I’m sorry, Malvolio, but this isn’t my writing, though I admit it looks like mine.
Now I must return to the wedding.
Nobody like that should be trusted.
The English army is near, led by Malcolm, his uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Over there, where Titinius mourns it.
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
I’ll send my prayers with him.
The enemy gets larger each day.
Good to see you, Signior Hortensio.
I know my medicine will work on him.
If I live to see it, I’ll never trust his word again.
With God’s help.
That’s cowardly and womanish.
My lord?
Please, leave me alone.
Yes, dear little chick, come along with me.—Shut up, man!
I’ll stop your mouth with a kiss.
I’ll go get my sister and see what she thinks.
I wouldn’t want to stay here and make you angry.
Today I’m going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edward’s children or his wife’s allies.
But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour.
He is, my lord.
When he woke, he wouldn’t know where he was.
I’ll pick berries for you.
I’ll disguise myself as you and pour out “my” feelings to Hero, taking her prisoner with the force of my love story.
You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice.
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught.
Count Claudio, when do you plan to go to church and be married?
You’re wrong about that, I assure you.
Oh, she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her.
Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them.
All women would be angry with you for doing it, even though I’m the only one who’s hurt by it.
I don’t know you.
Are you trying to remake me?
Boatswain!
He likes me, and I’ve given him good reason to.
Do you need something?
That’s true.
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation.
His drugs work quickly.
I’ll do anything you ask, monster, anything reasonable.—Come on, Trinculo, let’s sing.
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help.
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France.
Oh, I’m dead!
I’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re even.
Is he sane?
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief, now it’s time to cheer each other up with love.
Oh ho!
Cruel, cruel news!  
And what’s her story?
Give me what I deserve, and do your duty!
Please, Emilia, ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight.—
Still, Edmund was beloved.
My back aches too—
Is the building of your love already in ruins?
Well, I’m going to break in.
Do you think I’d break my oath?
As a friend or an enemy?
One thing is certain: he’s out of control.
If he’s nearby, I want an explanation.
I agree— Put a mark next to his name too, Antony.
He’s very bright.
Yes, she did tell us.
By God, I wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me, I think—not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory.
No, not until Thursday.
But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them.
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow.
But excuse me,  Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir.
By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out.
Well, my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot, while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot.
When he loses that, he’ll be drinking salt water, since I’ll never tell him where the freshwater springs are.
Music!
You do your job well.
There are more than enough willing women around.
Let me deal with this.
My lord, no one will believe this in Venice, even though I’d swear I saw it with my own eyes.
I’ll try to make myself worth your knowledge.
You have bested many things, well don’t try and best me.
Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away.
Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own.
You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio.
So the pale, angry moon, who controls the tides, fills the air with diseases.
That’s what’s driving her crazy.
So, she’s in on this too!
With whom?
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now.
They show their bloody heralds of battle, and something must be done immediately.
I’m dying an innocent woman.
He said he did—I don’t know.
So be it.
One of them was a man named Pinch: a hungry, narrow-faced villain; a skeleton; a fraud; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller; a needy, hollow-eyed, emaciated wretch; a walking corpse.
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned?
Quiet!
And I came with him.
Pish!
Then, if you dare to acknowledge it, I’ll take up my quarrel with you.
I don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul.
A bit of a hurry, my lord!
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me, especially when I’m slaving away busily.
What an excellent idea—he’ll soak up the wine!
I know the people of Venice well.
The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English.
But give words a chance.
You lie, you nasty, ungrateful thing!
Yes, what time is it?
Out of love?
She is in a better place.
Ah, good old Kent said this would happen—that poor, banished man.
And what do you know, boy?
If she won’t tell Benedick, someone else should.
Do so.
Into God’s hands.
Who is so low that he wouldn’t?
Oh, did he?
Don’t talk to me, Emilia.
I came here crying.
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule.
Because their business lies outside the home.
No, I won’t cry any more.
What are you reading, teacher?
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you.
There’s no masquerade tonight.
You rudely snuck out of bed.
Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping.
Madam, I’ve come here to try to make you like him.
Dissolute lowlife, you shall die.
Before he leaves this part of the forest, you’ll change places: you’ll be the one running away, and he’ll be in love with you.
You might just as well say, “That’s a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion.” Yes, exactly.
We can’t think that way about what we did.
For God’s sake, find a house to duck into.
Did you hear that?
He’s a fool, a madman, and a drowned man.
I feel I should recognize you and that man 
May God’s arm strike on our side!
That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander.
If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise.
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night.
By all means.
It’s like half your soul’s been ripped out.
Come, come, let’s remember why we’re here.
Then he shook Bassanio’s hand affectionately—and they separated.
It’s nice of you to remind me.
But I’m ashamed to kiss, sir.
You’re in a hurry, are you?
Some achieve greatness—” What are you saying?
But I will tell you this very plainly: I have challenged Claudio, and either he’ll accept the challenge or admit he’s a coward.
Who doesn’t know he’s dead?
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell.
You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to make his will—it would just make him worse.
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation.
Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest.
We might as well call him a man, since God created him.
Spring, summer, fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places, and now the confused world doesn’t know which is which.
You can’t go back into the house unless you want to fight with me—and if you’re willing to do that, you might as well just go and fight with him.
But even if I thought you were right, it doesn’t matter.
She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass.
Oh my Christian ducats!
My royal lord, you’re not entertaining the guests.
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging.
I don’t think there’s a man under the sun who’s worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard.
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio, and then we’ll journey on to see your son, who will rejoice at your arrival.
Is Fleance going with you?
Yes, it stinks very sweetly.
They’re pretty busy in there.
I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool.
Oh, was she now?
And now she’ll start moaning, of course— Are you asleep, my love?
Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.    
Get us out of here.  
If I tremble then, you can call me a little girl.
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules.
He’s not telling the truth.
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden, but the Adam from the jailhouse.
Oh, fine.
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur.
So you’ll be hanged at the state’s expense.
I told them to take  Oh, what a big mistake!
The Duke of Cornwall, my master and patron, is arriving tonight.
You’ll fall backward when you grow up, won’t you, Jule?” And she stopped crying and said, “Yes.” Now you stop too, Nurse, please.
He didn’t know how to stop it.
Doesn’t a Jew have eyes?
Let me know.
What on earth does that mean?
No, I’ll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument.
Please give me a little credit!
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality.
Well, she got away.
Can you buy them with money?
My employer is as good as yours.
My master is standing out in the street!
They’re such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we’re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace.
So you’ll bring the necklace to her yourself?
Yes, yes.
But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay.
Opportunity’s knocking for you, and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head.
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now.
I guess you don’t want it.
Their villainy nauseates me, and I must therefore vomit it up.
Good morning, Richmond.
Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair.
He mustn’t go to prison.
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies, ha?
Do so, good Messala.
Young girls call it “love-in-idleness.” Bring me that flower.
Do you know where I’m going?
Is that the latest we can do it?
Right now I’m away from home and I can’t provide you with proper care.
He’s wearing yellow stockings.
Here he comes.
I don’t expect him to answer for me, and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him.
Listen to me, good Shylock.
Your Grace can do whatever he wants.
Groan?
No, it doesn’t mean anything.
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten, because he’ll be too miserable for dinner.
Sir, do you recognize this glove?
God forbid he wants to challenge me!
If she is silent and won’t speak at all, I’ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence.
I’ll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it.
Where should we meet?
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house.
Who’s there?
And I have much less to comfort me than you do, since I’ve lost my daughter.
That doesn’t matter.
Will you come with me to hear this news, sir?
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me, but I’m working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor.
I’m not sick if you’ve prepared some honorable exploit for me.
Hasn’t he proven himself to be a great villain—slandering, scorning, and dishonoring my cousin?
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it.
From the earth, or the air?
It’s possible, ma'am.
Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain.
Kiss her soft mouth, and we’ll be off.
Call them.
I won’t allow it.
I won’t consider it.
Here, take my sword.
Say goodbye to me.
How long has he been possessed like this?
I obey all your thoughts.
What am I, a cane?
Light the candles!
Oh, right, good Catesby.
When you’ve finished all this, return to the porch of Pompey’s theater, where you’ll find us.
You can have it then, your highness.
Well, I disagree.
I hear that Edgar, Gloucester’s exiled son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
And it’s too bad, Brutus, that you don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself.
To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there.
Let’s see.
If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you?
He’s married.
If even then they don’t answer to your satisfaction, you can say that they’re not the men you thought they were.
It’s someone with a torch!
All right then, back home we go.
Now what?
Or maybe, to make it even more lovely, I’ll sing it when the heroine dies. 
He was a wreck, almost past hope.
Please, I beg you, don’t scold me.
I have come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
Good night, you amazing woman, you.
While he and I are at one, my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other, so nothing will happen that we won’t find out about.
What then, sick?
Try being sick, great greatness, and see if ceremony can cure you!
Oh, that bird from hell!
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her, I’ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her.
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime.
If you’re lying, I’ll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger.
Night is approaching.
But please don’t let any of your people wake me up.
Did you say Caesar fainted?
I must and will have Katherine for my wife.
Only Adam, Rafe, and Gregory were ready.
Good sir, stay close to me.
Now, by the world— It’s full of your ugly wrongdoings.
When I was putting on the Ceres show, I thought of reminding you about Caliban, but I was afraid of upsetting you.
You can’t force me any more than Hermia can beg me.
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this.
The French have reinforced their scattered men.
I’m just sorry I had to be the one to kill him.
When I could see, I didn’t always see clearly.
Bottom!
Help, help, oh, help!
I’ll chop her into pieces.
I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from.
Tell me once more what you say.
But just be patient until we’ve calmed the masses, who are beside themselves with fear.
Don’t you have one word of joy?
Oh, my lord, when wisdom and passion are in one body, it’s ten to one that the passion will win.
You gave an excellent performance.
It’s dark, like my shoe.
Was this ambition?
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic, grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books.
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog.
Well, if you don’t, then I’m out of here.
Yes, husband.
Sir John Falstaff.
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this!
Yes, if I know the language and the letters.
I’ll torment them all till they roar with pain.
But I beg you, don’t interpret my suspicions as slander against you.
I know who you are.
I don’t know.
Please let me go.
I know that my lady’s going to end up hitting him.
If the job had been painful, I would not have come.
Oh, that’s nothing, believe me, sir.
I am not treacherous.
Will you abandon her?
My lord, I informed them as much.
Good morning, my noble lord.
What did I do?
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern?
I await justice.
But please tell me, is my boy—God rest his soul—alive or dead?
Go back again, to be beaten home again?
My lord.
Quiet, everyone!
Come on, don’t quarrel with us, good old man.
I have a wife I love.
Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young.
It said, “Love me and don’t leave me.” How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring?
Come, last of my friends, rest on this rock.
Cassius, what a night this is!
My learned lord, kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn’t bar me in my claim.
Get up, I tell you!
Hello!
Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom. 
It’s going to be fun, I promise.
Well, sir, it’s better to say little than to be tedious.
And you’ll speak on the same platform as I do, after I’m done.
I look forward to that present.
If so, you’d be buying them to sell again.
Night is over, and day is coming.
Enough!
They did, Fluellen.
If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Tell me seriously, who is the one you love?
What’s the news among the merchants?
When we’re faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up.
What does my powerful master wish for?
Look, and you’ll see.  
It’s time to put our armor on.
If you complain any more, I’ll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you’ve howled for twelve years.
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances.
You’re as pale as your nightgown!
Here she comes, the brilliant fool-catcher.
A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that, even as an apprentice.
I’d rather get a husband from your father.
Hail to your majesty.
Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good?
You’re getting too angry.
I’m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters.
You must have figured out who I am.
Not so fast.
There, Leonato, take your daughter back.
But it’s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost.
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little.
Read it instantly.
Yeah, so?
O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to such good advice.
There are rats and thieves and pirates—not to mention storms, winds, and rocks.
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds
I’ll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen.
I’m arresting you as a criminal.
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon, I’m the man in the moon, this thornbush is my thornbush, and this dog is my dog.
You sound out of tune.
That makes me love you even more.
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her.
He’s laughed at my losses, made fun of my earnings, humiliated my race, thwarted my deals, turned my friends against me, riled up my enemies—and why?
Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow.
I’ll kill myself to save myself from slavery.
We’ll do it.
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her.
Come on, put your sword away, my little soldier.
And as you know, his connections, if he put them to good use, might be enough to hurt us all.
Are you joking?
No.
So everyone goes off into the world except me, who stays in because I’m sunburned.
I wish this trick would be over.
The Duke’s in a meeting right now, and he’s sent for you too.
You will never fall victim to Benedick’s charms, my niece.
Go to Francis Seacole, the constable of the watch.
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl?
You’re most welcome.
Why, here is the order to prove it.
But I swear I’m not the person I’m playing.
Oh, beautiful and accomplished lady, may the heavens rain odors upon you!
You’re my lieutenant now.
I have it ready.
I was never a thief or a pirate, though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons.
Oh, my!
Pretend that you’re standing on the shore, watching a city dance on the shifting waves, and you’ll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur.
I’ve got to go.
Where do you live?
The honest men.
Yes, I do.
Well gentlemen, we’ve heard our assignment.
I wear it with pride, for I am Welsh you know, good countryman.
He who will not follow me now, let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp, cap in hand, while some slave, no nobler than my dog, violates his daughter.
I won’t have any of this.
But you see my finger doesn’t have the ring on it.
You have, my lord.
Besides, she treats me more respectfully than the other servants.
She’s the devil.
What kept you from telling him this?
Oh, conspiracy, are you ashamed to show your face even at night, when evil things are most free?
In any case, Antonio assured the duke they weren’t with Bassanio on his ship.
No, Cassio wasn’t killed.
I’ve lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt.
Come, come, you weak, ungovernable worms!
Honestly, sir, we say that we are not criminals.
Go to the gate.
Now my spells are all broken, And the only power I have is my own, Which is very weak.
The spirits that know the future have told me this: “Don’t be afraid, Macbeth.
I’ll talk to you again tomorrow.
I beg your pardon.
I wish your loyalty were as foolish.
A kind good night to all!
Yes, like your horse, who, staggering under your boasts, would trot more easily if some of them dismounted.
Did you see anything?
Yes, let the count take you in your bed.
But there’s more work to be done.
If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it.
I go over hills and valleys, through bushes and thorns, over parks and fenced-in spaces, through water and fire.
More and more light.
Dark as hell, Sir Topas.
Come, let’s be off!
I’m going back into battle.
Therefore you must run, noble Cassius.
What can I say?
I feel sorry for you.
The only thing you can sense are punches—just like an ass.
It’s your job in life to kill the innocent?
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness, but if I went on I could outdo it.
Madam, his majesty asks for you, and for you, Duke of Gloucester, and for you, my noble lords.
If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens will be our rulers.
Stay right here and try to look good.
What are you going to do now?
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home.
Descend.
Since it’s drizzling, stand under this overhang with me and, like a true drunk, I’ll tell you everything.
Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
Well, I’ll hurry and put these papers where you told me.
He’s killed his wife!
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead.
Master Fer!
Here he comes.
Ah, my lord, this prince is nothing like Edward!
Let’s see, how can I
Go, Sir Andrew.
I don’t know.
Did you hear that?
Oh, rude and unthankful boy!
Stand back, boy.
I’m yours forever.
Okay, now I’m dead.
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief— Then what?
Wow, he’s a real devil.
The queen and her elves will be here soon.
You’re tigers, not daughters.
If you tell your lady I’m here to speak with her, and bring her out with you when you come back, you might make me more generous.
But don’t kill my sister and her royal sons, be satisfied, dear God, with our blood, which is being spilled unjustly, as you know.
Who delivered it?
Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog, as dark as hell, and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can’t run into each other.
I won’t be kind to you.
Pretty lady, I’m much ashamed of your shocking behavior.
Then you’re a fool for being sad that your brother’s soul is in heaven.
Will either of you give him the message that I’m challenging him to a duel?
Young man, excuse me, how do I get to the Jew’s?
You, Nick Bottom, have been cast as Pyramus.
I almost recognize that voice.
The king has agreed to every point: first his daughter, then everything else, as you strictly proposed.
That’s great.
I want you to live, since to me, death is happiness.
Why do you hide these things?
Kneel, Romans, kneel, and let’s wash our hands, up to the elbows, in Caesar’s blood and smear it on our swords.
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants?
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood.
Bad luck, bad luck?
Do you recognize this face?
I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this.
I hear a noise inside.
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet.
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying, vanity, babbling, drunkenness, or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to.— Oh, my God!
Why Dover?
Oh, a thousand times worse, a thousand times—and what a sweet personality she has!
Right now, my pressing business calls me away.
Look, here he comes.
I’m glad to hear it.
That’s the only witchcraft I ever used.
Farewell, then, Signior Lucentio.
Next he slung his arm around the bride’s neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo.
But I’ll stop rebuking you.
That’s not a job for a friend, my lord.
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much?
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime, I can endure her death now.
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room?
Well, then, put your sword away.
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now.
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much?
That’s what you get for marrying Christian husbands.
True.
No, my dearest love, I wouldn’t cheat you for the whole world.
Why are you enraged?
I won’t move to please anybody.
He’d be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail.
Welcome, my lord.
If not, what can you do about it?
No stony tower, no brass walls, no airless dungeon, no iron chains can contain a strong mind.
Nothing can be made out of nothing.
Yes, my master.
You get trickier and trickier.
The king has just honored me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people.
Come, I’ll show you your bridal chamber.
Hello, do you have any news?
Any man can get drunk sometime.
We’ve finished our business.
And you’re not to utter a syllable of Tranio’s name.
I’ll go join him there, going down deeper than any anchor ever sank, and lie with him dead in the mud.
Is that what you’ve heard?
What’s the treasure, uncle?
What, my good lord?  
I’ll drink as much as you do!
Come here, boy.
My message is not for anyone else to hear, my lady.
Macbeth!
And even if they don’t, at least Hero’s supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity.
What’s wrong?
You heard her say it wasn’t me.
Oh God, Benedick will plague him like a disease!
If it were nothing, you wouldn’t need to hide it.
Yes, he knew about it the whole time.
I’ve locked it up in my room.
They’re wise and honorable, and will no doubt give you reasons for it.
Fool, I say!
That’s like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses.
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face?
Come along with us, Signor Fabian.
Indeed, Hero herself can!
And all because I use my own money to make a profit.
I say it’s the moon that shines so bright.
Hurry, go!
Cassius, stand firm.
Clearly, men should not go out walking too late!
God save the charitable organization!
Good day to both of you.
Okay, let’s go!
And who is England’s king but an heir of the great York?
What’s wrong, Hecate?
No, madam, no.
There’s nothing like good hay, really sweet hay.
It’s a good thing you’re not a piece of fish.
Sit down, Clitus.
He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants.
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair, I hope he gives you a beard!
Who did it?
This isn’t a monster, it’s a devil.
He’s dead.
So take me to see them.
The prince has far outgrown me.
What have you done?
Either go someplace private, or talk it over rationally, or else just go away.
Honestly, it’s not as good as the other one, and I’m sure your cousin will agree with me.
I want to forget what I am.
So what’s the story, old boy?
If you can love me for this, take me.
Who’s in there?
Now that I think about it, Maria was the one who first told me you were insane.
For my brother Edward’s sake.
You horrid slave, you can’t be trained to be good, and you’re capable of anything evil!
God be with you.
I’ve heard her say that.
Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness.
My boy, it’s true.
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing.
I’ll help you.
Oh, he’s a dangerously clever boy—bold, quick-witted, capable.
Nothing.
As long as there are 
His cowardly lips turned white, and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam.
It wouldn’t hurt you to be charitable.
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes.
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
Yet not one among them, if all three were to wait on me, could be my “man,” because three such fakes don’t amount to a man.
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper.
Let’s have more sex in the world, since Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters, conceived in lawful wedlock, have been to me.
I do, and it sounds like you’re talking in your sleep.
Please, don’t take it badly, but I cannot and will not give in to you.
Look, you’ve got his wrinkled hands.
He stole it from me.
Again, goodbye.
This will either make us or break us.
Don’t say anything else.
Madam, you have to go to your uncle’s.
Oh, for God’s sake.
We took this pickax and this shovel from him, as he was walking from this side of the graveyard.
Callow youth, you don’t yet know how to love!
Poor man!
Please, leave me alone.
If any legs here are Trinculo’s, these are. 
Orsino.
If he is, that’s his problem.
The strangers are all gone.
Nice and short and full of good sense—or should I say nonsense?
Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in this second marriage, because it’s better than your first.
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this!
A prison like that would give me enough liberty.  
Come on, close the curtain, Nerissa.
Why?
Go wisely and slowly.
Well then, good bye, my lord.
He won’t have a chance.
Early in the morning we’ll both rush to Belmont.
Tie him up, I tell you.
Look, love, see how devoted I am?
Everyone’s there except Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone to look for you at your house.
You’ve killed an innocent woman, and you’re going to pay dearly for her death.
Things are what they are.
Yes.
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless.
Shame on you, Demetrius!
He’s a good soldier too, lady.
I wouldn’t change my mind even if she were 
But what’s this I see?
Which of these bad things happened to him?
It’s not my fault he acts like that, Helena.
Good morning, Kate, for I hear that’s what you’re called.
Farewell.
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men!
If you can prove that I’ll ever be so in love that I can’t be brought to my senses with a good round of beers, you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet’s pen and hang me on a brothel’s door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes.
He’s not sick, my lord, but he’s very upset, and his problems are serious.
Until the day we die, my lord.
Are you the slave who, with your slanderous words, killed my innocent child?
He only lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one, he died.
Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying.
If you’re my friend, tell me what you’re thinking.
Look at him.
Who is her mother?
Lord, it’s glancing every which way!
Just remember to grab his books first, since without them he’s just a poor fool like me, and can’t command a single spirit.
If there’s anything more sorrowful left to add, keep it to yourself.
Let me see her.
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky.
Where is your army, then, to beat him back?
I need proof!
Please, remain seated.
Really, I’m only pretending to be him.
Well then, God forgive me!
He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else.
Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.
I’ll go too and make sure that happens.
You lying brat.
I’ll hide in the arbor.
Here.
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant.
I don’t know, and he won’t tell me.
Did he confess?
My royal kinsman, are you teaching our princess English?
You have amazed me.
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets.
My friends, are you all Lady Olivia’s servants?
What a spoiled little brat.
They’ve eaten themselves sick.
You’ll never hear from the herald again.
Bring me a bigger one.
I’m better off because of my enemies, and worse off because of my friends.
Ha, ha!
Is love really tender?
of her father.
Please, fool, go away.
Though this island may appear desolate—  
Look, I have a weapon, the best sword a soldier could have.
She will not.
I can’t even be sure these are my hands.
They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he’s doing.
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax, my mother.
About the table, sir, dinner will be served on it.
What would you do about it?
He has some wonderful home furnishings—that’s what he calls them—that he’ll use to decorate his house when he gets one.
So let’s join forces and get revenge.
Wait a minute, gentlemen.
He said he was going to buy me a necklace, but I never saw it.
Follow me.
How amazing!
Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world.
But you began so rudely.
Let him think about his own debt.
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.
Stand back.
Don’t ask to see this letter.
If you survive, I’ll live.
Romeo, get out of here.
Men act imprudently sometimes, then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them.
Oh, who did this thing?
The gods protect him from so great a shame!
Edmund, you deserve me to be your woman.
Where’s your lute?
Add defiance to all this and, by way of conclusion, tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him, whose death sentence has been pronounced.” My king and master’s message delivered, my task is done.
Boy!
then I hope I have a life of misery!
No matter what you say, my father is not dead.
Then who took my letter to Romeo?
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor.
Where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on?
Death is my son-in-law.
Let’s give a fair verdict.
It’s a letter from my brother that I haven’t finished reading yet.
Today our hopes are at an end.
Yes, you are.
He’s trembling in his fit!
Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago?
First, I ask you what they’ve done; thirdly, I ask you what offense they’re charged with; sixth and lastly, I ask you why they’ve been committed here; and, in conclusion, I ask what they’re accused of.
I’ll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort.
You’ll “never trust his word again.” Come on, that was a stupid thing to say.
Let Merriman catch his breath—the poor dog’s foaming at the mouth.
No, because my manly heart is grieving.
Have you told her our decision?
You may as well undertake to be hanged.
Who can blame him for acting crazy, when inside he condemns himself for everything he’s done?
It is not courteous, you know, to assume you know my meaning before I’ve finished talking.
Pile of dirt!
If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success.
If this young gentleman has offended you, I’ll take the blame for it.
I’m glad to see your highness.
Don’t be so quick to twist my meaning.
If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight.
What did you think about that French lord, Monsieur le Bon?
They told me I was everything.
I will, my lord.
Goneril, you know how much I love you, but still I have to say— Shush, please.
Let’s go.
Do you have news from Verona!—What is it, Balthasar?
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage.
You say you’re a better soldier.
I’ll get back at him another way.
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world, and has nothing to do with her property.
What’s this?
What, the necklace?
I’ll look over the inscriptions again.
My worthy lord, your noble friends miss your company.
Thank you, I’m sure.
Tomorrow I’ll send the messenger.
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know.
Welcome, gentlemen.
I have a good eye, uncle.
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable—the most precious things in your life, those strong bonds of love?
Oh, I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer!
No, he’s in Florence.
He doesn’t have to care.
We’ll outwit them all—that old geezer, Gremio; the suspicious father, Minola; the prim musician lover, Litio—all for the sake of my master, Lucentio.
You’re mistaken about all that.
Draw your sword!
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love—as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death.
Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but it’ll never destroy my love.
I knew that would be your answer.
Here is the cap your Worship ordered.
Will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play?
I love you as a child should love her father, neither more nor less.
Not a chance!
Gloucester’s eyes?
He will if he lives long enough to become a man.
Oh, how stupid!
Whom should we look for in the castle?—Whose job is it?
Nothing, Messala.
No, not a bit.
As moral as me!
What prisoners of rank have been taken, uncle?
Lysander I want to stop, but Hermia stops my heart from beating.
Goodbye.
Yes, certainly.
He is a gentleman of a good family, and for his ransom, he will give you two hundred crowns.
That’s what the Prince and my fiancé say.
This morning, they’ve flown away and in their place are ravens, crows, and kites, flying over our heads and looking down on us, as though we were sickly prey.
You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall, have you?
The king has strictly forbidden it.
Traveling from Sardis, two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there, eating from the hands of the soldiers who’d accompanied us to Philippi.
What do you want from me?
Good morning, sweet Hero.
Where am I?
Listen to me, you traitor.
Oh, my daughter!
That’s like hot ice and strange snow.
For Brutus’s sake, I am indebted to you.  
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home.
How do you mean?
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?
Are you my daughter?
You go down toward the Capitol, and I’ll go this way.
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush.
As for myself, it was Greek to me.
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping, then you’re already up to your ankles in blood.
Now I’ll offend you whether I give it to you or not.
Aren’t things going well?
I’ll be crippled forever!
Yes, of course.
I will, my Hermia.
So you don’t love me?
My plans are almost at their climax.
Oh, it is my love.
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets, mocking us.
Come on then.
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship.” That’s some sharp, critical satire, and it’s not appropriate for a wedding.
Now I’m Dromio and no longer attached to him.
So, perhaps, did yours.
Now he’s a little crooked.
That will never happen.
It only looks a little paler.
It’s the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
My husband?
Go hang yourselves, all of you!
What must be will be.
The brave experience death only once.
As you know, next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married. 
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone.
That’s a lame answer.
Who’s that?
Don’t be disturbed by my illness.
You’ve stunned him.
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy.
You won’t get any bad cooks from me.
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown, when, if there was any justice in this world, it should be branded with the murders you committed—your slaughter of the prince who held that crown, and of my sons and my brothers?
Thus, I’ll leave without being kissed.
Beware the thane of Fife.
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me, and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate.
Let me see your eyes.
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time, or he’ll suffer for this.
Fine!” he says.
Tell your men as much.
You’re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner.
You there, sir, come here please.
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly.
Hardly, Kate.
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship.
Go tell him about this.
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me.
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food!
I don’t deny it.
God knows why, but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey.
A lover would have to be weepier, of course.
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy.
He has, my lord.
Tell her about my son Paris’s love for her.
It isn’t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw, cold morning.
But for a fine, elegant, graceful, and excellent dress, yours is worth ten of those.
Come on, I’ll take you, but honestly I’m only doing it out of pity.
Here, noble lord.
Myself?
I’m torn.
But I still have a little memory left, and there’s still some fire in my eyes; my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little.
If I stay longer, I’ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying.
What blessed work, my king.
Oh, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s me, it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I’ll travel to your father’s house.
You’re as wise as you are beautiful.
Definitely a tailor, sir.
If I told you I understood Greek, I’d be lying.
Do you know the way to Dover?
No, but Beatrice— Sweet Hero, she’s been wronged, she’s been slandered, she’s been ruined.
If he’s so sad and solemn when he’s young, I can only imagine how much he’ll cry as an old man.
Look up moonshine, look up moonshine!
I didn’t accuse you of lying.
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time?
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer.
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth?
I’ve never heard of that.
Let’s stay and hear the will!
Amen.
I can tell by the way you waggle your head.
How is it, my husband—oh, how is it—that you have become a stranger to yourself?
But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man.
That’s good, my boy.
Oh Setebos, these are handsome spirits!
I’ll think over what you’ve said, I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say, and I’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters.
If this logic works, that’s great.
I’m hanging on every word.
Now, my lord, what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won’t go along with our plans?
It’s a very pleasing night to honest men.
Yes, yes, Curtis, so hurry up and start the fire.
And you will be, or some people here will suffer for it.
Choose another tack.
If a man’s brain were in his feet, wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite?
And I had to be away!
Alright, I will.
If I could colonize this island, my lord— He’d cultivate weeds on it.
No, please.
He’s a good man.
How old is he?
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books; or you can bash his skull with a log; or you can stab him in the belly; or cut his windpipe.
The nasty devil’s biting my butt.
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt?
There has never been so black a day as today.
What did they do wrong?
The earth sings when he touches it.
I’ve never seen him like this.
Jailer, keep an eye on him.
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of.
You couldn’t find out anything about them?
I came here to tell you—I’ll make this short, since she’s already been talked about for too long—the lady is unfaithful.
Where are you from?
What’s going on, Dromio?
You pale face!
Go, girl, look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days.
To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line.
When I meet this gentleman, I’ll tell him what you’ve said.
Some water will fix that.
I hope you’ll recognize me when we meet again.
One of you go find the forest ranger.
Have you heard this, Cassio?
Whatever your highness commands me to do, it is always my duty to do it.
Sweet Montague, be true.
It’s disgraceful!
Goodbye.
That sounds like the voice of Friar John.
I’ll come with you.
Oh, wouldn’t it be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit, not by corruption?
He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him.
Good night, madam.
We’ll see, won’t we?
You think she gave it to Cassio?
I think you’ve been frowning too much recently.
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders.—Put his legs in the stocks.
I tell you, there are good men born at Monmouth.
Look, here’s the necklace.
Was it mine?
If he says anything against me, I’ll humble him, even if he were stronger than he is—and twenty punks like him.
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift?
The king loves you very much.
Oh pain!
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated.
I swear, at the moment I really couldn’t tell you how I ended up here.
How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven?
I’m not as happy as I seem.
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.
Fool, I’ll repay you for this favor.
Come on in, con man.
I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl.
Oh, goodbye!
You still haven’t said anything incriminating.
And now, let’s turn to our business with the French.
My gracious king.
As for me, I’m surrendering all my power over to him, giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life.
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?
Get on your way and hire those horses.
He couldn’t eat without me talking about it.
Come on, Nerissa, I have many things to do that you don’t even know about yet.
We know what’s appropriate for a watch.
You said the enemy wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions.
Will you have me?
Although you bring me joy, I can’t take joy in this exchange of promises tonight.
So please, old friend, give us some good advice.
If I cut my finger, I’ll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding.—And your name, sir?
Put a candle in my study, Lucius.
Go to the platform, Brutus.
I never hurt you.
Come on, you turtle!
I couldn’t bear to obey all of your daughters' harsh orders.
I don’t want to dance.
Mistress, I swear on my life that it’s true.
Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa?
Everything about this is unnatural!
Your royal father is murdered.
Give me access to them, and soon you won’t have to worry about them anymore.
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio.
So, listen, Hermia.
Here is his Majesty.
Sa, sa, sa, sa.
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you.
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt.
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to “make peace with God,” but you’re willing to go to war with God by murdering me?
He’ll tell you more of the story.
You have to read us the will, Caesar’s will.
The English have promised me thousands of troops.
Give me your arm.
As for his cowardliness, ask Fabian.
A strange fish.
No more about that, please.
The wind is right and it’s high tide, and I’ve delayed him a long time already.
What have you done?
But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house.
Buckingham, I need to have a word with you.
Please don’t take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken.
It was I, in fact, whom you promised to strike.
We can’t be in two places at once, both here and there!
Justice, find the girl!
You should be ashamed, generals!
How is that possible?  
It was yours, I swear.
Well, you have made a foolish choice.
Well, start thinking about marriage now.
Why, then, it’s time to put on my armor and instruct the troops. 
Well, at least that’s something.
But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing.
Sister, you know he promised to give me a necklace.
Are these our eyes?
Like that.  
The humiliation is all mine.
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I’ve ever seen.
With Cassio?
I’ll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church, if it’s at all possible.
Oh do-de, do-de, do-de.
Which one of you is the lady of the house?
Now it’s time to get your costumes together.
Were you thinking of spending the night here?
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high.
You, will you join with me?
I could have blown up the town in an hour.
I’ll give it to him.
Lovely Katherine, if you will love me well with your French heart, I’m happy to hear you confess it in broken English.
My lady would never want to lose him.
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.
Oh, a plague has been prevented, thank God!
That guy’s funny.
Our men have all broken ranks.
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear, an armor-plated rhinoceros, or a tiger from Iran.
As old and white-haired as you are, and you’re such a traitor?
Just being thanked is more than enough for me, madam.
Now I’m in a great hurry, as I’m sure you can see.
Well, that’s an  Stay, fellow.
I don’t know what I’m doing.
Let’s see.
We’ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers.
What, he never made you laugh?
There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face.
Tell me what you want.
I didn’t see him.
Let me see, let me see.
Don’t leave me in the lurch.
What’s going on?
Oh, I see.
I was conceived by a woman, and I thank her very much for all her effort.
They sit chatting by the parlor fire.
I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise.
Virginity makes her look sick and green.
She’s round, like a globe.
I have it on me here.
She’s not even fourteen years old.
Good morning, cousin.
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons.
If you sink, you’re dragging love down.
I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish.
I’ve done no more to Caesar than you will do to me.
Yes, my lord, I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news.
First kiss me, Kate, and then we will.
Who wouldn’t cheat on her husband to make him king?
There’s still a bit of daylight in the sky.
Nothing but “little” and “short”!— Why are you letting her insult me like this?
Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial.
O, this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery.
Master, knock hard upon the door.
You have.
How the hell does he know our language?
I’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding.
By my birth I rank above you, but don’t be afraid of my greatness.
Yes, my lord.
Show me, or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt.
Once I’m there, I won’t need a guide anymore.
How are you, Hero?
Well, that proves she’s in love with you.
Now go!
Don’t tug on my clothes.
Yes, and be wise.
Are you going riding this afternoon?
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people.
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch!
She provides an excellent moral.
I’ll tear her to pieces!
That duke who lives nearby is courting her.
Bring her out, brother.
Other than Richard, even those whom we fight against would rather we won.
My heart’s too sad for long goodbyes.
I was an idiot to take it!
Here comes your father.
My lord?
Eyes, look out for the last time!
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come, and, on her knee, she begged me to stay home today.
His military understanding is all theory, no practice.
Ratcliffe, my lord, it’s me.
Yes, and more.
Is Signior Lucentio at home, sir?
of patience.
Mistress!
Yes, that’s the one.
What, here in the middle of the street?
You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.
I’m satisfied.
Your life has had honor in it.
I’ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose, just to see how brave they are.
My husband.
And since we dream at night, time passes quickly then.
Gentlemen, stand up.
My lord and brother, God save you.
Next month he’ll stay with us.
I’ve heard that’s not the most nourishing food.
Then, to answer every man briefly, wisely, and truthfully—wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
Well done!
Good Cinna, take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge’s chair where Brutus sits, so he’ll find it.
How sound asleep she is!
But it’s no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown—a head, I mean—and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping.
No, he’s an ordinary guy who ’s got a gentleman for a son, since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he’s achieved that distinction himself.
Lead me to where you’re standing.
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind.
Damn her!
Speak.
Have you written that letter to my sister yet?
Look, sir, this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment.
He smiled and said, “The better for us.” He’s right, and that’s how it is.
Stay in your cabins.
Don’t be scared.
Blab my nonsense?
Good morning, father.
You’re appealing to a son who hates you.
What do you want?
All right, have it your way.
Good.—Now come, Ariel!
Want?
Please tell me.
Good.
I won’t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me.
I seek no revenge for myself, but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom, which you sought to destroy, that you must be punished according to her laws.
And I was right, because where’s your husband now?
I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons.
A nice message.
Indeed, it’s a strange time.
Follow me if you’re brave enough, and we’ll fight over Helena.
Do it, and shout like the city’s on fire.
Indeed, my child, at Saint Peter’s Church early Thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride.
Is that possible?
Your hand is  Well, I hope so.
Goodbye.
What’s this?
You’re wrong, you madman.
Yes, indeed, bring them before me.
Yes, my lord?
The sky shows countless stars.
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest.
Where could I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia?
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you.
To escape the decree condemning me
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun.
I’m ready.  
Come on, relax, dear.
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta.
I won’t fight you.
Now I’ll go see my priest, to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck.
Here comes the Prince and Claudio.
Greetings, good general!
If you say that, you’ll only be telling the truth.
Do you know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one?
I can’t sleep quietly in the Tower.
Your mistress is a good mount.
Shut up, you troublemaker, no more of that.
Sir, my king, don’t waste your time mulling over how strange this business is.
I’ll always be loyal to you, sir.
Merciful God!
I’ll humor him when he learns how to behave.
He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar.
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee, but can you take possession of his health?
When are you getting married, madam?
Goodbye.
Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto.
Then tell them to treat us well.
And if your love can produce something from its sadness, write a poem for her; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones.
You did—not just once or twice, but twenty times.
I must leave them and seek some better employment.
But please forgive me, darling, for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently.
I frown at him, but he still loves me.
Look, here she comes, with your ungovernable wives in tow, like prisoners of her womanly persuasion.—Katherine, that cap of yours doesn’t look good on you.
I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon.
If that means I don’t care about anything, you should disappear right now, since you’re nothing.
So, goodbye.
Yes, madam.
Do you want to sleep?
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot, does that mean, you think, that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot?
That’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed.
She’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
Please go inside.
I’ll vouch for that.
We’re wasting time here.
Don’t get wound up, my good man.
Let’s be disciplined and not delay, because tomorrow is a busy day.
Oh, Pyramus, get up!
Call my knights together.
When the time comes, tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I’ll return.
What kind of god is ceremony, which suffers more than its worshippers do?
But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
Claudio!
This is as rude as it is strange.
Whenever I mention him, praise him more than any man deserves.
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy’s Day.
I’m left with nothing to do in this weak, idle peacetime, unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about 
I like your new wig and headdress, though I’d like it more if the hair were a shade browner.
If you’ve been ordered back to Venice because of my father, don’t blame me.
There he is at the window.
Let them in.
No, sir, not at all.
You’ve made him so delusional he’ll go crazy when he learns the truth.
Don’t delay, Caesar.
Why, then, should I cry?
But how did you want it made?
Speak, man.
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show, though he now lies at the base of Pompey’s statue, as worthless as dust!
Ill will never prompted anything well said.
Tell them this, Publius.
The law’s on my side.
How wonderful my master is!
You mean however they dare.
My sweet, so do I.
I could go around the world in forty minutes.
If you want to cry over my bad luck, I’ll give you my eyes.
What is it, my lord?
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then, I ask you for justice now.
Get away from me, witch!” the fat woman cried.
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.
He’d begged me to steal it many times.
Yes, boy, I’m ready.
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover?
Yes, that’s it!
Doesn’t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent?
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.
Be quiet!  
Good morning, old Sir Thomas Erpingham!
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast.
I’d rather die.
I’ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago.
The heavens are being stingy with their light.
Ariel, go order my goblin servants to make these fellows' bones ache, give them muscle cramps all over, and give them more bruises than leopards have spots.
Sadness takes away our color.
No ship could survive this storm.
I swear on my life I won’t tell your secret.
Yes, madam, that’s the one.
She has royal blood.
Don’t be silly!
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind?
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion.
Sing it tonight.
But that’s not how you’re going to be.
Sweet saint, for goodness’s sake, don’t be so angry.
But why did you tempt the heavens like that?
Which one of them should I pick?
I sneeze on your manhood.
But will it be soon?
How  What, are you jealous, Oberon?—Fairies, let’s get out of here.
I’m sure everything will be fine.
No, not at all.
If you’re not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night, then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me.
If not, goodbye.
Don’t you hear me speaking?
Can’t Lord Stanley sleep?
You stay on the left.
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do.
They are harder than the stones the house is made of.
There’s a knocking at the gate.
If everything else fails, at least I have the power to take my own life.
Now, I swear by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, he will not make me a joyful bride there.
And you told me to bury my love.
We’ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines, just like in a ballad.
Step aside.
I love my master, and he’ll find me very hard-working.
My sister is all those things, or else she should be.
We’ll be ready when the time comes.
I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you, making the pine tree open and let you out.
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you, and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me.
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me, I wouldn’t have let him influence me.
But here’s a paper with Caesar’s seal on it.
Who are the actors?
So the fool follows you.
No, not for all of Venice.
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt.
Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my cell.
Please, sir, I beg you.
You’ll have wine enough, my lord, soon.
I could be sad if I wanted to be.
He’s my prisoner.
Please go, sir.
If either of you were a prince’s son, and you were imprisoned as I am now, and two murderers like yourselves came to you—wouldn’t you beg for your life?
Bless you, fair lady!
Why are you here?
Please hire Cassio again.
That’s the one.
What, out in a storm in the middle of the night?
Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.
Take it away.
He is as full of courage as of kindness, princely in both.
Be sad only at the fact that you’ll lose your friend—your friend doesn’t regret that he paid your debt.
You piece of filth, you’re lying!
Why, who’s so stupid that he can’t see through this fraud?
And love doesn’t have good judgment either—Cupid, has wings and no eyes, so he’s bound to be reckless and hasty.
man’s cheeks.
But I’m running ahead of myself.
My lord, here is the entrance.
She’s dead to me.
And your father was Duke of Milan, and you were his heir, a princess.
I’ll tear it up when it’s paid.
Aren’t you Lady Olivia’s fool?
If we meet him at Philippi, these people will be at our backs.
But come, lords, will you come with me to Edward’s room to comfort him?
And even then, in order for me to catch the fly your cousin, she must be blind?
Take some men and horses and go to her.
Otherwise, you’d see me blushing about the things you’ve heard me say tonight.
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support.
He’s great-looking, but how can you talk to someone who doesn’t speak your language?
Hitting his wife?
You sent for me, sir?
Listen to my little story, and when it’s done, oh, my heart will break!
It’s nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted.
Yes, probably, because I’m staying for lunch.
You imply that married men are fools.
Am I really like one of those guys?
I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger.
I can’t ask you to make my daughter live—that’s impossible—but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died.
You can’t judge me based on what I do tonight.  
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree, quite outside of his own sphere.
Why, are we turning to men?
Well, good for him!
Well, it’s not for me to say.
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they’re going to do and won’t back down?
Mend” me, you impertinent fellow?
Why do you need twenty-five knights, or ten, or even five, when you’re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service?
If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous.
Now leave me alone, as I said.
Well then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived.
And in public too.
Apparently so.—Cover their faces.
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on.
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight.
O, everlasting shame!
Hurry, hurry—prepare my horse.
I’ll show you how kind I am.
Nice save!
A drum, a drum!
Don’t I have a reason to be angry, you disobedient hags?
Surely, Luciana, it’s already two o'clock.
The more you beat me, the more I’ll love you.
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that’s about to pour out its contents.
We’re searching on land, but he’s lost in the sea.
Help!
I guess now she’s going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife.
I got it from him.
Watch over Signior Leonato’s house; with the wedding being held there tomorrow, there’s a great to-do there tonight.
Monday, my lord.
This is how the candle burned the moth.
No, please, read it like a sane person.
Make it a word and a blow.
Give me your hand.
I’m losing this duel of wits.
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels—senators, justices, common petitioners—will suffocate a feeble man almost to death.
This imaginary suitor for Katherina—I’d buy him the best horse in Padua if he’d get here quickly, woo her, marry her, take her to bed, and rid the house of her.
And as surely as I am alive, I am a virgin.
Here’s something good.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.
Yes, my lord.
Ah, this place is too cold to be hell.
See the wound that Casca made.
Ha!
The things that threaten me have only seen my back.
What’s your name, please, friend?
Oh, let us be merciful anyway.
What an idiot that monster is!
What could my sister’s letter to him say?
Think of your sins.
On the condition that your sister’s son, Publius, also must die, Mark Antony.
Thank you.
Since you’re old and respected, you should be wise.
What would you have said, my young York?
I’m sticking to the contract.
Ratcliffe!
Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me.
But what am I afraid of?
Where’s my son Edmund?
You teach me how I should act.
Don’t shed any blood, or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh.
Unpunished!
Did you call me?
The saddle maker has it, sir—I didn’t keep it.
Who’s blocking the way?
The fire is ready.
I’ll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself.
More and more pain for us.
Unless I’ve mistaken his battle flags, which I’m sure I haven’t, his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king’s mighty army.
Oh, that’s a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin, from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard.
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was.
My man—monster is so drunk he can’t talk.
What’s this all about?
That big ship over there looks no bigger
Death is the best way to cover over her shame.
Neither?
I beg you, listen well.
Please wait, sir.
Oh, really?
If the news is good, you’re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that.
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death.
The next bit of good news is that our ship—which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago—is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail.
It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket.
Coward!
Shame on you; I’ve already run out of patience with you all.
If only his lord were more like him.
Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt.
I’ll get her, but I won’t keep her long.
Will you, Strato?
Madam!
We rejoice to see you, most worthy brother of England.
Oh, Pomfret, Pomfret!
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are!
Well, let’s hope your good fortune continues!
What a stupid man he’s become!
Oh, don’t injure your cousin like that!
It’s not the right time to play.
Short but still tedious?
At that exact moment, Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him, an ass.
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before?
I’ll go call the watch.
justice will be rewarded.
My good qualities, my legal status as Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me.
There’s something else.
I wish I knew what was in your heart.
I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring!
I’m not sure, but I don’t think so.
Won’t you tell me who told you that?
But listen to me, signor—
You are Dromio, you are my servant, and you are yourself.
Listen, boy!
Now, Balthazar, you’ve always been honest and faithful to me, and I trust you still are. 
I would have made it short.
This is the most miserable hour of all time!
He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for him.
Is tomorrow the 15th of March, boy?
The French are still fighting.
It’s hard to make sense of such different stories.
Cousins, you all have work to do.—Oh, I beg your pardon.
Go to your cabins and be quiet!
But he’d been there before me, and they told me he’d gone out looking for me.
Lord, how you’ve changed!
Kill!
Oh, he’s good at bending words around!
I think I did, sir.
But goodbye.
And last night at dinner, you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed, brooding and sighing, and when I asked you what was the matter, you gave me a dirty look.
Well, she can get used to it.
I’ll put up my shield and battle you.
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart?
Well, the poor man died by your first order, which was carried by a winged messenger.
Everyone, please leave us alone for a moment.
I don’t know.
Oh what a curse marriage is!
Add details of your own to back up what I’m saying.
I wish I had never seen it!
Duke, please go ahead with your state business.
Listen!
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I thought I saw the forest begin to move.
What a strange sight—a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home!
He’s a good-looking young man, and there are a lot of people with him.
Welcome, sir.
Don’t talk about Helena.
Well then, sing a lullaby to your generosity: it’ll nap until I come back.
Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off.
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions.
Enough!
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears.
I will perform this ceremony every year.
By our Lady, I think that’s true.
Down with the Montagues!
No, I haven’t had lunch.
So go and put your stamp on the girl.
Don’t bring me any more reports.
You’re standing.
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception.
Yes.
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life.
Listen, hussy—is this man one of your customers?
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda, who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day.
It’s Hortensio, isn’t it?
So, what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company?
Don’t hurt me.
Good news, friends.
Oh no, sir, I won’t let him go, sir, not without a good reason.
Now that I think about it, I really want it.
It would be hard, almost impossible.
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting.
I don’t like it that you knew about this, Iago.
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave?
to wage war.
Please come in.
We’ll put a picture of you on a sign, right above the words “Come see the tyrant!” I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm, or be taunted by the common people.
I’ve sent for him.
have lost, and the indignity we have endured, for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back.
If you want things done in the right way, you’ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice.
I’ll try to calm him down for you if I can.
Oh,a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life.
Since he has the jewel I loved, which you swore you’d keep forever, I’ll be as generous as you were to him.
Try again.
No, not at all.
I told him what I thought.
The clock says it’s daytime, but dark night is strangling the sun.
Ma'am, you wouldn’t treat me like this if I were your father’s dog.
Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation.
Sometimes I’ll turn into fire!
Go now and get cash.
It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself.
You wrong me in every way.
I like you guys.
Come on, let’s go inside.
I’m listening to you only because I’ve got nothing better to do.
Let’s go!
You bastard workhorse drudge!
I took the hint and spoke to her.
Oh, if it turns out to be true that he survived, then that storm was kind, and the ocean was full of love!
Do you know him?
I  Let’s not break the law by starting a fight.
Some dungeon.
My cousin’s a fool, and you are too.
Come, ask me to do anything for you.
Up.
I’m neither, my lord.
We’ll cool the mixture with baboon blood.
They’re all welcome.
So could I.
Give me my fan, Peter.
But let it go.—Now, Litio, it’s your turn.
Six or seven thousand, at most.
A rebel!
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio, the Prince, and me.
What, we’re going to die?
Is there anything inaccurate in that?
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio.
They grow like savages—like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood—surrounded by swearing and stern looks, ragged clothing and everything unnatural.
Oh, you stupid Moor!
Let’s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out.
How are you, Malvolio?
The man in the moon!
It’s a reason for suspicion, even though it’s just a dream.
You thought you were being funny, but you said the truth.
Alas, grim death, how vile and ugly your near-twin, sleep, is!
That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again.
Hey!
I wouldn’t have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds, to be paid by the shah of Persia.
Who tricked you?
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy, under which our army lies, ready to die.
Are these spirits we see before us?
Help!
You’re a hardworking villain who’d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to.
In suicide, gods make the weak strong.
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— No, heaven forbid!
Is your master coming?
Bring us the letters.
I hope things go well there.
Tell me, you unknown power— He can read your thoughts.
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed?
I’ll read you a sermon.
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
They really wish they were somewhere else, but they want to descend on us, looking fierce so we’ll think they’re brave.
I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here.
Where are you from?
Please, get some excellent music, because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window.
May God keep you well, sir.
If a ship’s leaving, come to the marketplace.
I know her by her walk.
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match.
Any minute.
You’re in a bad mood?
My noble lords and relatives, good morning.
It is.
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now?
Would your highness like to take a walk?
Who’s that?
In the meantime, hold on, and be patient.
M”—Malvolio.
That, stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, he’s coming to England to claim the crown.
Good morning, Benedick.
Lazy people end up at the bottom, and you deserve to be at the top.
No more foolish talk.
Why are you still crying?
Damn it, who’s there?
I think I can find him.
I’m not sure I can wait that long.
I’m not sad, my lord.
That’s not good.
Give me the vial.
It won’t go on.
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay, your conscience will fly out?
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart.
Go up there and second his petition.
But if I shake it up a little it’ll work, because every one of those letters is in my name.
Who in the crowd is calling me?
I’d rather be a peddler.
You’re a well-dressed lady.
Please, somebody, get us out of here!
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible, challenging every enemy he sees.
What do you have to say to me now?
A good laugh.
Have you sent anyone to Bottom’s house?
From their saddles into the dirt—but that’s another story.
What do you think, Bottom?
It would have been better if, after she said, “Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone.
Who’s that calling so loud?
Just know this before I begin: I can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note.
We have a little dessert coming up. 
It is, my lord.
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter?
Get out of my sight!—Dear Cesario, please don’t be offended.—Get out of here, you barbarian!
Yes.
No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain.
So I’m free.
Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash.
These men all have one intention, and it’s directed against Caesar.
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has.
So don’t think that I’m drunk.
It’s a big deal to you.
Stop it, I order you.
Is it not enough, is it not enough, young man, that I’ll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius?
The king is virtuous and kind.
Will you marry her?
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here, because he’s clearly disturbed.
Are you ashamed of me?
Now, lords, don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition.
Ha?
Yes, every man forward.
No, my good lord.
Damn it, you’re not listening to me!
I’d rather adopt a child than have one of my own.—Come here, Moor.
Take a trumpet, herald.
Lucillius and Titinius, order the commanders to have the men camp for the night.
When you free your children from the sword, your grandchildren will repay you in your old age.
Absolutely, yes indeed.  
Why are you making these faces?
He’s welcome too.
I don’t believe it.
Gracious brother, I will go with them.
I’m not one of his sluts.
This is the silliest thing I’ve ever seen.
And he’s still warm, by God.
You’re a villain to say this about me.
If I don’t love her, I’m completely 
If that’s not enough, I’ll sign a contract to pay ten times that much, and I’ll give you my hands, my head, and my heart as security.
He really plays well.
On record, my gracious lord.
Who are all these people?
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid.
Hey monster, the spirit you’ve been talking about, the one you call harmless, has been playing tricks on us.
The partygoers have arrived.
Quiet!
You did it?
Also—I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this—in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me.
Here’s the indictment of the good Lord Hastings, which has been written out in a clear hand, like any legal document, so it can be read aloud in public outside St. Paul’s Cathedral.
But action speaks louder than words, so I’ll cut short these polite words.
Officers, take them away.
Leave them alone until he sets off home, and then follow him.
I thank my heart—the poor fool—for it keeps away from seriousness.
How is your majesty doing?
Have you forgotten her?
She can stay at her father’s house.
May you only give birth to male children, because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine.
Here it is.
And I swear to God he’s very smart.
Come down, look no more.
And now it looks like you need my help.
I am no tyrant but a Christian king, whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons.
Where are the noble Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night, and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story.
I’ll ask them.
And I love Hastings with all my heart.
Can you smell out his secret now?
What proof is there?
Are you down in the dumps?
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be.  
What news do you bring?
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this?
I hope, sir, that you’re not angry that I’ve been equally attentive to you both!  
I know it’s foolish to be so much in love, but I can’t help it.
Thinking, my lord?
Yes, and that’s surprising, because lovers are usually early.
Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls, I’ll play a set in France, God willing, that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court.
While we’re walking, you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night.
Doesn’t a Jew have hands, bodily organs, a human shape, five senses, feelings, and passions?
If you’re Stephano, touch me and speak to me.
I know him to be valiant.
My ships will come home a month before the money is due.
Are you in your right mind?
Didn’t great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice?
This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self.
If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood.
Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I.
I’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a good, honest person, sir.
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame.
Please, don’t speak to him.
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses.
Help me.
Here’s some money for you.
That’s why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears.
How else is he the “man in the moon”?
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit.
And let the wise man run away.
Come, let’s go.
I didn’t hear anything.
If I were in England now, like I was once, and I had even a painted picture of this fish, every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it.
My lord, his throat is cut.
Please, don’t forget to leave me a tip.
I’m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn’t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion.
Shouldn’t she just accept that?
Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me.
What, isn’t my mother coming?
All of you who are looking at her, wouldn’t you swear that she’s a virgin, judging by these outward shows?
I’ll follow the priest and go with you; and after I’ve sworn to be faithful, I’ll be faithful forever.
The world’s gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments.
The king has heard them, but as yet has made no answer.
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit, and I’ll have fun there forever.
Drunk?
I’ll find your servant, and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here.
No, my cousin, don’t wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead.
Day has broken.
Oh, I thank my lucky stars, I’m so happy.
What’s that good for?
If I were king?
You’re absolutely right, your highness.
Are you hurt, lieutenant?
Prepare the horses for your lady.
Where should we stable our horses?
Henry the Sixth, crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy, succeeded him.
And leave you out?
But still, she’s going to kill you for being gone so long.
Three thousand ducats, hmmm.
I will kiss your lips.
Gonzalo is a miracle-worker.
May they relieve a sick old man’s suffering.
Now get out of here!
Honestly, I can’t.
When a majestic king starts acting silly, then it’s my duty to be blunt.
I’ll tell him the news.
If he wakes up before we kill him, he’ll never stop punishing us.
murder!
Don’t ask me anything.
Then, at my farm I have a hundred milk cows, a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables, and all the equipment necessary to maintain them.
My library was a large enough dukedom for me.
Can I have a word with you, Lucillius?
Oh, they continually urged the king to do it.
I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by anyone born from a woman.
Then leave her, sir.
I’ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once.
Be brave and do well!
Who are you, moaning in the hut like that?
Please be quiet.
Oh, no, good gentleman!
Remember to see me today.
My brother whom—aside from you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land, and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my education.
Good food’s not a big deal—everyone can afford that.
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me, and then killed herself.
God be good to you!
I did kill her.
It may be so.
My friend Antonio, all I can say is thank you.
The captain—give it to the captain.
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.
That’s unbelievably bad.
I beg you to let me go.
This is a good agreement.
I’m not scared of you.
But now it’s stopped.
Sir, I think I have the right to speak, and speak I certainly will.
I’d give anything to keep them from seeing you here.
And I wouldn’t ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one.
Or are you just teasing?
Seek!
Come on.
Two or three men, my lord, who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England.
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Thank you, sir.
Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your attitude about getting married?
Don’t harp on that point, madam—it’s past.
Come on, we’re wasting precious daylight.
The prince has done neither; therefore, in my opinion, he isn’t really protected by sanctuary.
He builds our fires, gets our firewood, and does all kinds of useful things for us.—Hey!
The more I suffer, the more spiteful he becomes.
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky, I put myself right where I thought it would hit.
Here it is.
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing?
Give me your blessing.
As a matter of fact, if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe’s belt, it would have been a very good tragedy.
He won’t catch a wink of sleep, either at night or during the day.
You call this house dark?
Why?
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick.
And here I am, going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can’t find my Hermia.
We’ll talk about this later.
God give him health.
Come, death, and welcome!
From our brother monarch, the king of England?
He’s coming, madam; but he’s acting very strangely.
By my father’s death— Your life has dishonored his death.
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now.
He looks humbler than he used to.
It’s a bad time for such an injury.
Ouch, what a comeback!
The Moor is being tricked by some crook, some terrible villain, some rotten bastard.
Let’s put our heads together.
This is the final discussion I will grant.
God save your Majesty.
These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before, and I’m afraid.
Listen, because Tybalt was just killed, people might think that we don’t care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party.
Good job, my little one.
I will, my liege.
He  I can’t tell what’s going on.
There are ten thousand— Geese, you idiot?
We have two hours to get ready.
He spends most of his time with the good, noble Claudio.
Swaggering?
You have the nerve to call me daughter?
Said what, sir?
Damn my soul if these accusations are true!
What do you have to say for yourself?
You know I’m powerful enough to make you pay for this.
I’ll come too.
It’s already almost night.
You once stole my position; now you get to have the grief that goes with it.
I will.
Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight.
Good Portia, go to bed.
No, don’t press up against me.
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.” That’s a nice group of people.
And some have greatness thrust upon them.” Heaven help you!
Don’t ask why.
She will not come.
He won’t see my face ever again.
But Count Claudio can stay, for what I’m about to say concerns him.
All right, now I’m starting to lose my cool.
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden.
But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out.
I’m glad Casca is with us.
He never did harm that I heard of.
I’ll pay you.
I never gave him any token of romantic love.
But whatever misfortunes occur, they can’t ruin the joy I feel with one look at her.
The other half goes to the state.
Here is the door, sir.
I’ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens.
No, just to the gates of hell, where the devil will meet me, with the horns on his head like a cuckold, and say, “Go up to heaven, Beatrice.
The only glory princes have are their titles.
Signior Tranio, you also took aim at that bird, though you didn’t hit her.—So here’s a health to all who’ve shot and missed.
joy except my love for you, and I find that only your majesty’s love makes me happy.
Give us a smile.
Because my name is George.
Meanwhile, their  They’ve said their prayers, and now they wait for death.
Sex and marriage are honorable things—even for a beggar, right?
This fellow will out-talk us all.
I lent my body once to make him rich.
What do you think, will my friends prove loyal?
He’s dead.
To tell you the truth, they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition.
That villain, Romeo.
Don’t be afraid of greatness.” That was well written.
Today’s a holiday, so the beggar’s shop is shut.
That’s it!
We human beings don’t control our own destinies.
Stop hollering, man!
Alas, she has been too long exiled from France, whose crops all lie in heaps, rotting with ripeness.
Richmond is sailing on the sea.
Now we can shout, “Congratulations, congratulations, my lord and lady!” My Lord Bassanio, and my dear lady, I wish you all the joy I can wish for.
What do you say to a calf’s foot?
Oh!
creet.
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil!
Go back with her?
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born.
You had this child with the help of heaven.
Wake up the Montagues.
Please take them off.
And I too?
Please, write down “Borachio.”—And yours?
How about it, Corporal Nym?
I hear their drums.
Venus went home again, and her little son broke all his arrows, swearing he’ll never shoot them again, but play with birds like other little boys.
Oh, Brutus!
Come, gentlemen, let’s go in.
I won’t bother with it.
I’m not.
If you could only hear this testament—which, excuse me, I don’t intend to read aloud—you would kiss dead Caesar’s wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood, and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by.
Where are you coming from?
But Edward is still alive.
You know, uncle, A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow’s head off.
And Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover.
Should I believe that death is in love with you, and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress?
Your husband’s mad, isn’t he?
She’s too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven’s blessing by making me despair.
Blow the trumpets.
Don’t tire yourself out, monsieur.
I would’ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her, the lowest-ranking grunts and all, as long as I didn’t know anything about it.
Calm down, calm down.
I am a spirit, yes, since I have a soul.
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could.
All right then, legitimate brother Edgar, I have to have your lands.
Cassio, do you know who might have stabbed you like this?
know myself!
Decius, go tell them that Caesar won’t come.
Don’t deceive me.
No, just help me unpin this.
I heard him swear he did.
No, definitely not!
Romeo has been banished.” That news brings infinite death.
While we were here guarding you as you slept, we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls, or lions.
Are you ready, sir?
The king made peace among all of us.
It fell on a little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love.
We age and die because they wear us out.
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful.
Set it down.
Come, come with me, and we’ll do the job quickly.
Therefore tell me the Dauphin’s mind frankly and without constraint.
How much does he owe the Jew?
Come here, you wretch!
Hey, naked guy— Poor Tom’s chilly.
He’s been captured or killed.
Oh, dear.
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
Goodbye to you both.
Give me some ink and paper.
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me.
Take off my mistress' gown for your master’s use!
No, madam, I’m just reading an insane letter.
To show you that that’s me, let me prove it a little even in this case.
Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm!
Am I in France?
We don’t come here with the intention of making you happy.
You see how kind everyone is to us, how they just hand us gold.
The day is well on its way.
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager.
But come on, inconsistent young man, come with me.
How are you, your highness?
I’m telling you to make a fist and pound.
But, tell me, where is the noble Richmond now?
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia’s African servant.
Hang our flags on the outer walls.
Orsino.
Why, what’s the matter with him?
Yes, let’s do that.
Draw your sword, you jerk!
Romeo killed Tybalt.
And return to us immediately, bringing Messala with you.
Come on, tie them up.
You’re absolutely right.
He’s giving her a taste of her own medicine.
She only appears honorable from the outside.
Thank the lord for alliances!
I’ve come to say farewell to my king and master.
Oh, I wish you weren’t, you poor, frightened soul.
And so you do.
I am the son of Marcus Cato!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!
They will steal anything and call it spoils.
Did you call me, my lord?
Lucius, wake up!
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life, because the instant he strikes, he dies.
Master, master!
Go, hurry.
But shhh!
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do.
Oh, oh!
I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t take Othello’s place.
If love is blind, it can’t hit the target.
By this leek, I swear I’ll make you pay for this.
Send for him, dear uncle.
Good night, good boy.
Here comes the man who rescued me, sir.
What endeavor, Popillius?
I never talked with her in my life.
Finally, the ceremony done, he called for wine.
If you would have such a man, take me.
Well then, he’s God’s soldier now!
Here’s some money for you.
Kill Claudio.
How are you going to live?
Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here.
But first I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell.
Why are you so sad?
If it’s fighting he is after, some of us here should run and hide.
What’s the matter, lady?
I’ll moan very believably.—Name the other actors.—But I’m really in the mood to play a tyrant.
Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the best friend I had.
I’m afraid we’re intruding too boldly on your sleep time.
Go to Adriana, you scoundrel, and quickly.
And also to find out the size of the enemy army.
There’s some gentleman out there.— Good Sir Toby!
Tell me, my good friend, what is that light over there?
You must all keep up this united front.
They see, smell, and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands.
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere!
Let me gather my wits and get serious here.
I will find the time to cry for you, Cassius, I’ll find the time.
Cassio!
And where’s Cordelia?— Do you see this, Kent?
They can’t move till you release them.
Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven.
If its juice is put on someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep, that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees.
Two of both kinds makes four.
What, are you afraid?
Therefore, love each other in moderation.
Go quickly—hurry—to the castle, for I’ve given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed.
Yes, my lord.
And my king goes on: if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands, Henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face.
Call Claudio and some of my other men.
Good girl, give it to me.
Who can tell me who I am?
In a way, I mean.
Where is the villain, Edmund?
What man were you talking to at your window last night, between the hours of midnight and one?
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours, my courage as great, and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown.
My brother Gloucester’s voice?
I want to be friends with you, and forget all the times you’ve embarrassed and humiliated me.
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place.
I know it.
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise.
Why, what’s the matter?
What did you do that for?
I’ll challenge him.
Yes, Caesar?
Your life insurance?
My stomach’s a little upset.
I saw her, but I didn’t notice her.
You inhuman dog!
Hurry up, I say.
Not the one I gave you, I hope.
I’m coming, don’t worry.
Look, if you really love the beautiful Hero, enjoy it.
I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost.
Hey, bride!
You see me here, gods, a grieving old man, as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age.
Sleep well there on the ground.
The more you joke about it, the more clearly I feel how serious it is!
Who are you?
We can’t waste time between now and six o'clock.
Here’s the money you wanted, master.
Come on, brother!
Off with his son George’s head!
I hope she keeps it short.
I recognize the handwriting.
First, he sends his regards.
No.
We failed in half of our mission.
But what about Cicero?
Is this the madman?
What, everybody falls asleep so fast?
Who sent you here?
You suffered a loss like mine?
Come with me to see the duchess.
Hello, Tubal.
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction?
Yes, every inch a king.
Yes?
Some kind of fountain?
Where have I been?
Please stop, sir.
That he was never trained as a soldier.
But Miranda is so much more beautiful, you can’t even compare the two.
This ring, sir—oh no, it’s nothing.
And it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time.
I’m not like you.
No, it would be impossible.
That’s my way, when I see a crab-apple.
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him.
He said that the people weren’t used to being spoken to except by the  What blocks of wood!
My door is locked.
What a man!—especially compared to my husband.
Tranio got you that time.
Now that you are down there, you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb.
I don’t like your faults.
The king will be angry with him.
I found him here,  Beating?
As soon as you kill Prospero.
We argued about which was best, and now we won’t get either one.
A rotten, foolish monster.
He might have treated me like that, because I’m as unused to abuse as a little child.
Why are they shouting?
What support did we have besides our father?
I’ll drain the life out of him.
Get me some poison tonight, Iago.
Oh ho, oh ho!
Oh, if only I were a man!
I’d hate to see you drowned in honey, sir.
Who, Hero?
Hello, sir.
The only thing that I’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house, the Phoenix, for lunch.
God doesn’t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him.
Sir, I’m puzzled by what you just said.
Hey, Grumio!
Not me.
No doubt, for you wear too many in the first place, and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer.
Is it feasible?
You’re wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles.
Help me here.
Oh, what a villain I am!
With one little toss of his head, He can scare you off for good.
No, go ahead and take my life.
I’m not a paid messenger, my lady.
This is the way to trick gullible fools.
Do you even get what I’m saying?
It would be bad if she knew about Benedick’s love and teased him about it.
Here he comes, my lord.
We want to hear the will.
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that?
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye?
It’s good if you love Hero, because she’s worthy of your love.
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs.
Thank God and my horoscope!
He’s somewhere between boy and man.
I had a dream last night.
The spirit is torturing me.
Well, Susan died and is with God.
Now that he’s old, we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws, which have turned into deep-rooted habits, but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age.
Oh, deadly sin!
You just said all your lines at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter.
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.
I regret my crime more than my death, and I beg your Highness to forgive me, while punishing my body with death.
At the bottom, any change is for the better.
Richard loves neither me nor any of you.
I wish you’d never met him.
I just meant that our hearts are joined, so we can almost think of them as one heart.
Help, help, help!
Did Cicero say anything?
So were their daggers, which we found on their pillows, unwiped.
Farewell, old man.
Where are his eyes?
Be eloquent on my behalf.
In Orsino’s heart.
But don’t take all that pain on yourself.
She has the stones on her, and the ducats.” I know, all the boys in Venice are following him, yelling, “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!”
I am no villain.
Father is on the lookout.
Hortensio, have you come to break up the fight?
And you’re not suited for any place except hell.
Here an angel’s lying in a golden bed.—Give me the key.
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles?
Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit, we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to. 
Oh, please be quiet.
You wrong me, Brutus.
He’s a fool and a spendthrift.
The general is talking to you!
Let us hear him.
Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.
If you’d like to talk tomorrow, I’ll come to your home.
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts.
Give me your hand.
We’ll both be safer if we go separate ways.
It will likely be a bloody fight.
Let us die honorably.
My wife’s coming.
And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing, he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold—groaning and sweating under the load, either led or pushed, as we direct him.
Show him in.
What’s her skin like?
That’s a lame threat from a toy gun, a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch.
Don’t I deserve more than this?
And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then France is yours and you are mine.
What handkerchief?
And has anyone ever won her, as I’ve done?
Sir, don’t even try to beat me in a battle of wits.
I don’t think you’ve got much of a reason to love me.
It’s my best option: I can’t afford to lose forty ducats.
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it, nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated.
That’s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down,            Please, uncle, hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie.
It is, it is.
Play some music while he chooses.
And hot as ginger.
Though I wish you were dead, I’m not going to be the one to kill you.
That’s one of them.  
I’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil.
Whatever we decide to do.
Fruits and vegetables don’t ripen until the right season of the year.
I’m right behind you.
Look, let’s stay here tonight.
Yes, it is.
I’m terribly sleepy.
Agincourt.
He speaks bluntly, madam.
Lorenzo, that’s for sure, and I’m also sure you’re my love—who else do I love so much?
Do you want to go in and join the party?
The general and his wife are talking about it now, and she’s defending you strongly.
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers.
No, I’m as honest as I am Christian.
What are you talking about?
This, this All-Souls' day, is my just desserts.
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind, and if you can’t take it, then you’d better plug your ears.
I have to tell you everything.
I am dying!—My lord, you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished.
Well then, Margaret, Ursula, and my cousin have been very much deceived, for they swore you did.
Since I can’t amuse myself by being a lover, I’ve decided to become a villain.
It’s not true.
I did it myself.
If I don’t answer, perhaps you’ll think I’m accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me.
Pray, let me stay.
Farewell, good Salisbury; and may good luck go with you.
I’m like the one sick sheep in the flock, the one who deserves to die.
Good morning, neighbor Gremio.
My lord?
Ask him to go in.
I can’t wait to meet her!
From this moment on, I’ll never say another word.
But not a member of the royal family, like me.
I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight.
Are you backing away in fear?
This guy’s wise enough to play the fool, and only clever people can do that.
Therefore, drink up.—Servant-monster, drink a toast to me.
Sir, let’s get to the point.
I believe you are, Regan.
You’ve got a sword, Gloucester.
No.
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny.
Did you kill him, then?
Moreover, out of mercy, the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent, so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where, poor wretches, their bodies will likely fall and fester.
Did you hear a noise?
Stand up.
Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage.
What’s up, Catesby, what does your master say?
On my knee, I humbly ask your blessing.
I order you to come with me.
I can only repeat what I’ve said before.
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others' tools, that fisherman should play with paints, and painters should play with with fishing nets.
Pyramus is coming up to the wall.
I can’t talk about my happiness anymore.
I’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker.
He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet.
That’s already been done, sir.
Go on, get out of here.
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking?
Here is the count of the slaughtered French.
You’ll never see me again, whether or not he’s dead.
Well, because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count’s messenger better than she’s ever treated me.
Nothing?
Pardon me, lords and gentlemen who stayed awake.
I’ve almost missed the time he requested.
Oh, how I love you!
But in this case of wooing, a child shall father his own father—if my wits don’t fail me.
Who calls so coldly?
He was wrong to do that.
Now, by St. George, my knighthood, and my crown— The first you profaned, the second you dishonored, and the third you stole.
The next person to strike again dies.
Oh, now I really need that priest who spoke to me today!
No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it.
I admit I’m only a woman, but I’m still a woman from a noble family—I’m Cato’s daughter.
Talk to the ambassadors who’ve just come back: ask them how majestically he responded to their message, how well supplied he was with good advisors, how restrained in expressing his displeasure, and, moreover, how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve.
I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out.
Time will tell what you’ve got up your sleeve.
Who are the new commissioners?
Give me your hand, Kate.
I hope we have the time some day!
Like an invitation.
Oh earth, which soaks up this blood, revenge his death!
Yes, if I’m still alive, and you’re still sane, and your dinner is worth eating.
Has it come to this?
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo.
Here lies Hero, The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words.
giving it back to him.
I won’t take it back.
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms.
He does hear me, and that makes me cry.
I think this night is just like sick daylight.
Are you still so cruel?
That’s right.
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine.
This guy doesn’t pay much attention to punctuation.
But wait a minute!
Of what city, may I ask?
This castle is in a pleasant place.
Oh, it was a monstrous roar, to make the earth tremble!
You.
Good morning, gentlemen.
It’s only four o'clock now.
I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.
That’s the right attitude.
Oh, to hell with those people!
Therefore, willingly and yielding.
I showed it to you once.
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you.
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this.
Men may sleep, and when they do they may have their throats with them, and some people say knives have blades.
A king, perhaps— My lord— How is it that the prophet didn’t tell me at the time that I would kill him?
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Yes, but the clerk will never do it, unless he grows up to be a man.
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you.
It was just moments ago.
It is my rival for Bianca.
This may end without anyone getting killed. 
Get me a surgeon!
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people.
I swear, I think my wife’s faithful, and I think she’s not.
I know you.
If I can bear that pain, then I can bear my husband’s secrets.
And when you do— Cassius, calm down.
The other girl did not love me.
And would I have ever done that to you?
Oh, Stephano, two men from Naples survived!
But God forbid he says no to us!
Antonio, you’re under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino.
What captain do you serve?
A hundred then.
I’ll kill myself out of grief!
Come here, ma'am.
I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now until dinner.
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone?
No one’s life should have been entrusted to them.
Goodbye, then.
Who were you chasing with your sword?
I’ll tell you more later about when and where we met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged promises, but now I’m begging you: please, agree to marry us today.
Never, my lord.
How did we manage to get ashore?
The adult snake lies in the ditch.
When he wakes up!
And she can cry, sir—oh, how she can cry!
Go away.
A murderer should look like you do, so pale and grim.
So take your last breath.
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we’ve been asked to convey?
This is beyond weird.
I’ll give the Jew my flesh, blood, bones, and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me.
If you’re someone who gets into fights, I’ll fight with you.
But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo has been banished.” To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead.
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently, and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs.
To hell with you!
You were born from a woman.
He’ll do whatever Hastings does.
Cesario, you missed your appointment with me.
When I ran into this holy man, those men you mentioned did come to mind, in fact.
You thug!
Come, find the conspirators!
Yes, fashion is fashion.
You mean “paragon.” A  The duke’s leaving the temple.
are you going to let them break me out of jail?
They say Gloucester’s bastard son is.
Look at you, standing there in a stupor!
What, are you sleepy?
You’re too bitter.
Everything except something to live on.
They were traitors.
Well, it certainly wasn’t true for Richard!
I grow old, and all dignity has been thrashed out of me.
Stop, Demetrius!
That’s all I wanted to know.
No, Caesar doesn’t have epilepsy.
What’s the matter?
I’ve had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice.
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol.
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up.
I’ve got my answer.
Darling Kate!
Do as I tell you.
Stay inside.
Come now, keep your oath.
There, take that, you scoundrel!
Bring his will here, and we’ll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people.
I’ll read it.—It looks so unlike Portia!
Some villain has told lies about me.
Give him this deed and have him sign it.
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs.” Crisscrossed?
The man should be inside the lantern.
If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our bodily urges would take over.
Signior Angelo, please excuse us.
Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams.
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof.
And, moreover, God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden.
Maybe he won’t see me.
Your threats don’t scare me, Cassius, because I’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze.
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me, I’ll try to get him to do what’s good for him.
Oh, it’s dreadful, dreadful, Iago!
for the other men, we can make them believe anything we choose.
Your husband lies dead there, and Paris too.
What a pain.
If I have killed your children, I will have children with your daughter.
I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him.
Our country weeps, it bleeds, and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds.
How did you two get separated?
I wouldn’t commit so serious a crime for anything.
So have your money ready.
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen, and what you deserve is to act like my subjects.
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land.
I wish you all the best.
And we’ll leave together, like friends.  
Go get me a crow.
I have received letters that say the same.
Your father!
You’re so infatuated with him that you’re hallucinating.
It sounds more like you’re insulting me.
Stay here, Titinius.
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do.
According to what I heard, they had no travel plans as of last night.
I believe it.
There was no harm, I’m telling you.
Come with me, please.
Shame on you, you slanderer!
What kind of man is he?
His daughter and I will be king and queen—God protect us!—and you and Trinculo will be our governors.—Do you like that idea, Trinculo?
She was filthy!
In a time like this, it doesn’t make sense to criticize every offense.
Please, educate me.
Goodbye, then.
Halt!
I am indebted to you for your last sermon.
I feel better already, and I know there’s more good advice where that came from.
Do that, my friend.
I didn’t, my lord.
If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.
Well, the difference of a horse!
But, Lepidus, go to Caesar’s house.
And the doctors say it’s healthy to get up early— I don’t know what the doctors say.
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep.
What do you think?
Signior Baptista, I’m glad to see you.—Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.
What are you going to do?
Squabbling?
You do their work for them and give them good luck.
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar.
You’ll be afraid to hear it.
That was my turquoise ring!
Poor imitation queen, why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he’s got you trapped in his deadly web?
But I’ll get you a candle and paper and ink.
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools.
Ugh!
No, none at all.
Your mother is coming to your bedroom.
You know what you know.
Farewell, good Strato.
Are you trying to sleep with him?
No one’s listening to you.
And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion?
Then let’s go in and hear what he has to say—though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word.
Are you really saying these things, or am I dreaming?
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb, and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven.
Do you have any doubts, Antonio?
Good idea.
I have to eat my dinner now.
I saw a thousand shipwrecks, a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone, huge anchors, chunks of gold, heaps of pearls, and precious jewels—all scattered on the bottom of the sea.
Your joke is a very bitter apple.
I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed.
We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us.
I was about to swear that I loved you.
Please put up with my weakness.
No, my dear cousin.
Duke, the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice.
I’ll tell you as soon as I know, Richard, because at this point I have no idea.
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order, who came after Clarence was already buried.
It’s a messenger from the warships.
Where’s Peaseblossom?
Sir, I know I’m not a flatterer.
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman.
So now turn and draw your sword.
It doesn’t matter how I am: he hurt me, and that’s that.
Hold the friar too.
But before they reached us–let me say no more!
I desperately needed God’s blessing, but the word “Amen” stuck in my throat.
Where, where?
I’ll make ground beef out of you.
Doesn’t Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice?
They’re saying I’d be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear.
The cold wind’s still blowing through the hawthorn tree. 
Lucentio!
I’ll go to Ireland.
Not good ones, please.
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land.
And now you know my meaning.
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way.
Go away.
No, not at all.
I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll regret causing me this loss.
Please, my king, be quiet.
Revenge.
He was graced with lots of natural gifts, he was young, valiant, wise, and no doubt meant to be king.
All right, then.
So much for our plan.
I didn’t find him at the Elephant.
And if it doesn’t go well, then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery, the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation—away from the public’s eyes, tongues, mind, and insults.
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened.
Where have  Come here, boy.
No, son.
One more thing, good gentlemen.
Should we watch this ridiculous scene?
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
She said if she were interested in someone, it would be someone who looked like me.
Oh, you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider, that hideous toad!
And here comes the warden, just in time.
Good night, dear Captain Blunt.
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall.
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind.
I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy.
I wish I were senseless, sir, so that I wouldn’t feel your punches!
And do you mean what you’re saying, Gratiano?
I’ll let you know my answer shortly.
Be silent, or else my magic spell will be broken.
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today.
Right, and well said.
Ha!
It was Kent, sir, the exiled Kent, who, after the king treated him like an enemy of the state, put on a disguise and followed his king, carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave.
I think she’s the most wonderful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on.
You can’t talk about something that you don’t feel.
I’m sorry I hit you.
The moon sets at twelve, right?
I’m involved in your rivalry.
It’s a miracle you’re alive.
Well, for your good looks, sir, thank God and don’t boast about it.
Nice to see you.
These are the messengers from my sister and the king.
You’ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me.
That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look, and that’s how I look.
If I can tame him, I’ll charge as much as I can get for him.
We’re all against what Caesar stands for, and there’s no blood in that.
Really, my lord, I don’t know what to make of it, but she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all understanding.
Yes, if your memories do you no good.
Go, Pindarus, climb a little higher on this hill.
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men!
But come on, let’s see you do your dance.
Where do I live?
Are you insane, talking like this?
It’s the wind.
Have him come to me here, soldier.
The word is too good to represent her wickedness.
Mark Antony will say I’m not well, and to please you I’ll stay at home.
Now I’ll stand up.
Hell and damnation!
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of, yes or no?
The criminal is the one who stole the nest.
For God’s sake, shut up!
I want you to see the difference between us, so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon.
What do you want?
I recognize his walk.
Sir, fifteen days of March have gone by.
Please let me go.
There’s meaning in your snoring.
Then go gather your men, but leave behind your son, George Stanley.
Fool, speak well of yourself.
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver.
Here comes one of them now.
If you love me, let me know by smiling at me.
You’re not really my daughter, but I still have one daughter left.
I’ll bite my thumb at them.
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch.
Well, what do you guess?
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep.
But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.
Those who have done this deed are honorable.
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war.
Play, trumpets!
Tell me where you’ve stowed away my money, or I swear I’ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I’m not in the mood.
I won’t lodge any more than that under my roof.
Well, all of these should be in the lantern, because they’re all in the moon.
Ask me any commonsense question.
Take pity on Poor Tom, who is persecuted by the devil.
Lead the way, sir.
No, my noble lord.
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house.
Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me!
At least I don’t have a horse for my mistress—or a saying so beside the point.
He couldn’t see you.
I’ll lie here tonight.
Why, good sir?
They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men.
No, let’s not swear an oath.
He said she was unfaithful?
He was crazy to run away.
I’m going now.
Fill my cup, Lucius, until the wine overflows it.
Oh, and young men never die?
Montjoy.
I use it all the time, since it’s all that I have.
Oh yes, three thousand ducats.
What’s this?
Give me the letter.
What do you want to do, Desdemona?
Actually I think I would, and then I’d undo it after I did it.
Don’t be afraid, even though you see me with a weapon.
Listen Tranio!
If you pursue it, this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there.
Medicine is for the dogs.
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame, so I’m not going to say any more about my boys until I’ve gouged your eyes out with my bare hands.
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes!
Why are you hiding that letter?
Sir, is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly?
Drink when I order you, servant-monster.
There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed.
Relent?
Thank you, doctor.
I will settle this matter. 
The fool’s nice enough, but he’s such a huge eater, and slow as a snail when he works.
God save the king!
Speak up and tell me!
He’s nearby, and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master.
For heaven’s sake, help me!
Find out the way, and I’ll find the right man.
What do you want?
If so, when it’s day, where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face?
How is my Juliet?
Babbling senselessly?
Oh, it’s a disaster, a disaster, by this hand, it’s a disaster.
You should pity me for that reason, not hate me.
And isn’t your husband an honorable man?
Madam, I will.
A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless.
Isn’t there a guard around?
Here’s mine.
I mean a husband.
I bet you’re a happy fellow who doesn’t care about anything.
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous.
The poor thing, I really think she loves me.
Do it well, and then leave us.
Okay.
I charge you, in the name of God, be careful what you say.
Self-love, my liege, is not so great a sin as self-neglect.
The tunnels!
He knows what?
She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her.
I wish I was your bird.
Oh, come on, woman.
Where are you hiding?
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight?
It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times.
Conrade, I say!
My lord, it’s news I wish I didn’t have to report.
Oh my, what’s the news?
You will be an accessory to both crimes.
Romeo.
I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out.
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses.
I’ll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard, or a sandy beard, or a red beard, or one of those bright yellow beards that’s the color of a French coin.
You have to stop talking like this.
There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife.
Never!
I’ll get him to come here, and you can ask him yourself.
Did he charge interest?
We must remember the gravity of this sad day.
Unfortunately, I love myself.
No, sir.
There’s very little about her that’s gloomy, my lord.
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living, breathing saint.
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would.
And I’m telling you it was burnt and dried out.
Go look and then do the talking yourselves.
Sister, calm down.
Goodbye.
Can I go away while my heart stays here?
I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you, Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter.
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch.
But I’ll write again to Mantua, and I’ll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes.
So, so, so, so!
If you were a woman, I’d hug you now and cry, and say “Welcome back, drowned Viola!” My father had a mole on his forehead.
Then please tell me he’s all right.
But for one reason they refused to execute her.
Go release them, Ariel.
Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper.
Did this happen before the King of France returned home?
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs.
No?
It carried us toward Corinth–or so we thought.
But I’ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining, the sons should be their fathers' guardians and manage their fathers' money.
Let him become Caesar!
Good morning, worthy Caesar.
Wait, here’s a coin for you.
You mean, to bear me, not to bear        My protector, Richard, insists on it.
Murder!
Oh no!
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes.
Why should we do this?
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners.
It wouldn’t let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body.
The man who killed Mercutio, which way did he go?
We are free from his tyranny.
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man, but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself.
I wouldn’t stay here tonight for the entire town.
Let’s talk.
If Echo were as fast, he would be worth a dozen like Belman.
You, who are neither honest nor good.
Biondello, go and tell your mistress to come to me.
I’m at your service until death.
Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right.
Miranda.—Oh father, I’ve disobeyed you by telling him that!
He’s not your man.
If true lovers are always thwarted, then it must be a rule of fate.
I’m growing a beard.
Soldier, why are you wearing that glove in your cap?
Now he lies there worth nothing, and no one is so humble as to show him respect.
Yes, yes, my lord.
I thought that thing you’re talking about was a man.
You lie, you disgusting tyrant.
Are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now?
Don’t look so sour.
He’s certainly crossed the river Somme.
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood.
Come on, Sir Andrew.
No, I won’t stay a second longer.
Enough, Captain.
Help!
You admit it, then?
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny.
Where are you running so fast?
I see that you are poor.
If I default, he’ll pay you.
If he’s been killed, say “Yes.” If not, say “No.” These short words will determine my joy or my pain.
Oh, you lowlife!
A ghost, a ghost!
Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that?
Yes, why shouldn’t she?
You’re kidding!
I’m biting my thumb.
Go away, now.
Start the fire, good Curtis.
It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes.
You taught me language, and all I can do with it is curse.
No, don’t pause, because I 
What work can you do?
On, on, you noblest Englishmen, descended as you are from battle-tested fathers, fathers who, like so many Alexander the Greats, have fought in these regions from morning until night, sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight.
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her.
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation—if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years.
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love, when merely thinking about love makes me so happy.
So, I won’t.
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it?
She’s calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her, just like I murdered her relative.
She cheated on me, and she was a whore.
I know I can do it.
All three of them are crazy with despair.
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes!
He’s still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise, though he puts on this show of stupidity.
If you think about it correctly, Caesar has suffered a great wrong.
Virtue is beauty, but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil.
Why did I ever have one?
So how short am I, you painted barber pole?
Get the lady out of here.
Rub his temples.
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself.
If you were my fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for getting old before your time.
Do so.
Turn the ship to the wind!
The armies have merely changed places, Titinius, because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus’s forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius’s legions.
Everything would be produced without labor, and would be shared by all.
You know what, my lord?
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good?
Tranio, let’s go.
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time.
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him.
Were his wounds on his front side?
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan’s pipe.
Are your doors locked?
Sir, pardon me for what I am about to say.
Daughters who can make you obey them.  
Tell me to tear up this contract.
Tell me, you monster, where is my son Lucentio?
I didn’t realize he knew her.
Which two crowns would those be?
Come, Dromio, let’s go.
He is a subject for a king to contemplate, and for a king’s king to ride on, and for the world at large—both friend and stranger—to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at.
We don’t want it at our festivities.
Yes, it truly is.
Well, God is responsible for that, not me, and he deserves thanks.
Two of them are completely honorable, and if they have been tricked in this, we must blame John the Bastard, who lives to create conflict.
And they thought Margaret was Hero?
He had one yesterday.
Sometimes you get a bit too wild, and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude.
What else is love?
Because, my good king, England is so poorly led, her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain, silly, shallow, impulsive youth, that she’s hardly a threat.
But where have you been?
I swear I never hated you or your father!
My lady Olivia, your niece, disapproves of your late-night partying.
Robin Starveling, you’re going to play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the handyman.
You would run away from a bear, but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean, you’d turn around and confront the bear.
Yes, my lord.
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse.
Good luck.
No, my lord.
Oh, God help me!
No, if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell.
Look how she carries on with him!
What does that have to do with my Lysander?
It’s getting late.
Only until noon, my lord?
I wish you’d do what I ask!
The earth has bubbles, just like the water, and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth.
Damn it all!
I hear him.
The river in Monmouth is called Wye, but the name of the other river has gone out of my head.
I don’t know what you’ve done to upset him, but someone has challenged you to a duel.
He doesn’t long for the dawn as we do.
Why, too much freedom leads to woe.
Are you really going to tell me that?
It’s new to you.
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus.
What else you do know?
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time?
I want this to provoke confrontations, so I can give him a piece of my mind.
That’s better than exaggerating our trust.
The worst thing imaginable has happened.
Now he won’t give me either.
I myself am playing the man in the moon— Well then, that’s the biggest mistake of all.
I’ll have to tell the story again every month, since you seem to forget it.
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head?
Gentlemen, we won’t stay here and anger you further.
Damn your wine!
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity.
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements.
Soon all my work will be done, and you’ll be free.
I’m not sure, my lord.
If that’s true, it’s a serious fault, and Caesar has paid seriously for it.
You wanted to be king of the island, sir?
I’ll get you for that.
Master, is this Satan’s mistress?
There’s a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman.
It’s been longer, it’s been longer.
Now, you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August’s labors, get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here.
Did you say Cassio?
Otherwise—forgive me, but if you should die before him, what becomes of her dowry?
Don’t worry about the consequences.
Emilia, go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened.—Will you please go now? 
Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir.
But despite all this, your daughters will give you a lot of money—or do I mean pain?—in the coming year.
Brother, you’ve made a mistake.
Give me those flowers.
How is my wife?
Halt!
I thank your Highness.
So stop crying.
Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied.
Pick up this rope ladder.
Hail, Caesar!
We’re bound to each other in every possible way, except we need you to marry us.
The queen is dead, my lord.
I don’t think so, my lord.
What, that’s all?
I saw her buried in her family’s tomb, and then I came here to tell you the news.
But you’d still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil.
Halt!
Where are you, keeper?
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body, then good things would fight to live in it.
It’s a disgrace to us all.
Thank you very much.
Give me your hand, sir.
Lord,” he calls you?
Let’s go there.
Pray God your wife doesn’t send you a worse one.
Are you gone like that, my love, my lord?
But please, tell me: is he coming home?
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you, Antony, were Caesar’s son, you would be satisfied with them.
I am Benedick.
The Hero that died!
Let’s go to the temple first.
If you leave me like this, you’re doing me wrong.
Signior Baptista, I’m actually in a bit of a hurry.
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I’m being murdered.
Calm down.
Am I on earth, in heaven, or in hell?
And from now on, when you get hot with me, I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that.      
What’s the matter?
That’s completely beside the point.
No, no, the bell.
Yes, sir, we’re part of her entourage.
I’ll go with you.
You see how the world goes, Volumnius.
Please, do so.
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck.
I’ll do most of the drinking for you.
We all must die, Messala.
How I wish you felt better!
So with no money, but a little more wisdom, I’m going back to Venice.
No one passing by?
God have mercy on us!
Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart.
It’s “never get tired.” Oh!
There’s money in it for you.
Yes, very bad.
Ask him in here.
Even the best jewel can be tarnished.
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease.
But oops, when I let go of your hand, I let go of the biggest joke of all.
I’d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here.
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what’s good for you.
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks.
Let me have it now.
Shush, sir, please!
Or maybe there’s a chance he didn’t drown.—What do you think, sailors?
Tut, tut, you’ve become rather icy.
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me.
Don’t worry about how I handle it.
I’ve noticed it myself.
Get off the field, my lord.
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers, do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it?
You love me in spite of your heart, I think.
What, are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to?
No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on.
Have you seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?
He’s fine and healthy, madam.
Can I have some?
God have mercy, Grumio!
Ha!
I don’t even know him.
I wish you well.
I can’t believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death!
The demon Hoppedance is in Tom’s belly, crying for some fish to eat.
You bring your cauldrons, your spells, your charms, and everything else.
It’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us.
Paying debts is for peasants.
Then I’ll call you a serving-creature.
Yes, it’s Emilia.
Has any man seen him at the barber’s?
Yes, look, it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers.
Just one glass.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates.
But you can make it up to me.
I can’t wait to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant.
Wait!
Then let God grant me that you’ll be damned for that wicked deed.
Is  Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands?
I’ve outshot you, and not for the first time.
Good morning to you.
No, you’ll have to excuse me.
I think so too.
I’ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman.
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks?
Father, take pity on him.
Sir, please, don’t be angry.
Romeo!
Go blabber with your gossiping friends.
I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears.
But tell me.
No doubt, but you may be going about it the wrong way—Neighbor, this gift is very gracious, I’m sure.
I’m no ordinary fairy.
Oh, Cassius, if you could only convince Brutus to join us— Don’t worry.
I’ve never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets.
I didn’t refuse you.
Nothing.
Do you really think there’s a man fool enough to marry into hell—however rich the father is?
Let’s listen to the moon.
Lay off, already!
Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would’ve made even a nun want to sleep with me.
This is going to be great!
What are you going to tell her, Nurse?
Please forgive and forget.
The storm has begun and everything is at stake.
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul?
How unbelievable!
We’ll probably witness many more outbursts from him, like banishing Kent.
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much.
Look at other beautiful girls.
Thanks for your trouble.
Yes, madam.
You can take your chances after dinner.
No, you don’t need to worry about us, Lorenzo.
The boy is warning me that someone approaches.
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff’s deputy.
Instead of crying, let’s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men.
Why?
And my poor  He’s fainted.—My lord, my lord!
If they let you off, then we’ll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power.
Ha!
Let’s drink to our general!
Oh, help me, anyone who wants to live long!
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
Boy, I beg you to run to the senate house.
What were you before this?
You can’t have anything but the penalty, to be taken at your peril, Jew.
Don’t swear at all.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no part in the killing, will benefit from his death—receiving a share in the commonwealth, as you all will.
It’s meant in good will.
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree.
Getting right to the point, I live near the Capitol.
Isn’t he getting funnier?
I thank you, Sir John, with all my heart.
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke’s to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half.
But how long will “ever” last?
I had you figured for a piece of furniture.
Come on, Casca, you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise.
Mountains don’t tremble, however much the wind may blow!
Go on, tell it.
Just now.
But what did you want?
But go away now.
If I’d been a common laborer and hadn’t taken him up on his offer, to hell with me.
I should go to the barber’s, monsieur, because I think I’m getting really hairy around the face.
Stop—if you can’t be kind, at least have some shame.
Welcome to Cyprus.
Passionately”?
Hush, Grumio.
He has almost finished dinner.
All the rumors have been confirmed.
Follow her.
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire, and they are coming after to warm themselves.
He has a father, and yet he is fatherless.
Are you over your ridiculous mood?
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you.
You may be exaggerating the risks.
I gave it to Dromio, who rushed in for it.
I’m not who I appear to be.
No, no, with God’s help, his son will be king.
Didn’t I use to have four or five women taking care of me?
I won’t.
My uncle the king is to blame for this.
Casca, you’ll be the first to raise your hand.
Little” again?
You are too evil for words!
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two?
But I’m as noble as my opponent.
Didn’t I?
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand.
Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him.
We will do the same.
And who are you, good sir?
Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad.
He won’t listen to anyone’s advice.
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you?
I don’t love Hermia; I love Helena.
Where’s your conscience now?
So, tell me, assuming I win your daughter’s love, what dowry would she bring to the marriage?
Be there, or don’t show your face again.
Better late than never—and it’s never too late to change.
Upon the king!
No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve.
So goodbye, my lady.
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing.
I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds.
First, he said you had no right to him.
Take it off and throw it on the ground.
You’re leaving with my tongue in your tail?
My lord?
You’re not going to take him.
And  Madam, with all my heart.
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun.
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill, you shouldn’t try to hold on to it or it’ll break your neck.
Come on, you and I will go soon.
Lunatics, lovers, and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations.
My name is Pistol.
Goodbye, nymph.
My lord, I won’t miss it.
You haven’t heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
Right now I’d give a thousand 
You scolded him in private?
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now?
Yes, the state’s half can be reduced, but not Antonio’s.
It’s pretty.
The interest rate will be— Well, Shylock?
What about Falconbridge, that young English baron?
Well hello, my good boy.
Come help me bless this couple, so they will be prosperous and have many children.
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well, and now he’s become a real man.
Oh sirs, consider this: those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it.
They’ll kill us!
Look how she rubs her hands.
So go.
I wish I could live longer.
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference, for—to be honest, though it’s probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage—my men are considerably weakened by illness, my numbers reduced, and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen, though when they were in good form, I tell you, herald, I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs.
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered.
Don’t you have any manners, you savage?
The last time I was in Exeter, the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it “ My lord!
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you.
Titinius is lying face-up.
Why the hell did you come in between us?
What’s the prize?
You’re right, that’s how it is.
Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.
Bianca’s love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town.
Your answer is so strange!
I swear, I scorn the word.
I had no idea she was cheating on me.
I have nothing to say to you.
Aren’t they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships?
Well, we were all born to die.
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive.
This is a love token from some other slut, and you want me to copy its pattern for you?
Put a lot of cash together.
Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off.
He is in heaven, where you will never go.
Goodbye, boy.
Some people will laugh at anything, and others are so grouchy they won’t even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny.
There, take my fool’s cap.
Listen!
All I’m saying is that strange things have been going on.
I don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side, or if he secretly aided the rebels, or if he fought with both of our enemies.
Your behavior is an insult to all women.
Meanwhile, I’d be gratified if you’d live and eat your food.
Do whatever you want with it.
Old Montague is here, and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad.
It’s easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them.
Oh, teach me how you look the way you do, and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you.
Everything’s fine now.
I beg you to pardon me.
Use your clubs and spears!
Their story is bizarre and astounding, but it’s solid and consistent.
Killed?
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, Vitruvio’s widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
And why’s that?
What did you say, uncle?
Oh, yes I am, father.
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide.
Rise, princes, and, with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords, rush to the battlefield: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; you dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, Berri, Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Fauconberg, Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois.
Maybe you think that I think you’re in love.
We just want you to answer to your real name.
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour?
I don’t have that kind of reputation!
We’ll maintain that she died the instant she was accused, and everyone who hears this will grieve for her, pity her, and excuse her actions.
What’s going on, Borachio?
Do you think so, spirit?
I’m going now.
It’ll be worth your while.
He followed the old man.
I think he will stand strong with us.
He’s not standing straight enough to hold a flag.
Hello, sir.
So be quiet.
Leonato and his brother.
It’s gone.
I see Regan and Goneril in hell—A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them!
I’m dying to hear your life story, which must be a strange tale.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
There’s a fool sharing my bed now.
Niece, you are exceptionally perceptive.
She is so generous, kind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can, even more than she is asked to do.
Tell me what I want to know.
Why do you look so depressed today, your Grace?
Who’s calling me?
We have to go out and talk to them.
Why have you collapsed?
Doesn’t she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom?
Oh, the poor man!
Tell me anything you remember.
I’m going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you’ve caused me.
I did too, and he also swore he would marry her tonight.
No.
Are you sick?
That’s a nice hat you’ve got there.
In the entire play, not one word is well-written, and not one of the actors is right for his part.
These are frightening odds.
What did my man say?
No, a flatterer wouldn’t, even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus.
It’s almost morning, but I’m sure you’re not fully satisfied about what happened.
That’s a good way of putting it.
Get over it.
Look for him, Titinius, while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news.
We’ve got to act fast, my lord of the fairies.
Before the bat flies through the castle, and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it’s nighttime, a dreadful deed will be done.
Who’s there?
This dream has been interpreted all wrong.
How old is she?
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy, my lord.
Farewell to you both.
Are you talking about the crown?
I’ll give my vile body back to the earth.
I’m off.
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it.
Gentlemen, go in there and grab him.
Get out of here, you horrible ghost, you hallucination.
Has she told Benedick how she feels?
It’s on such a high tide that we’re now floating, and we must take the current when it is offered, or lose our campaign.
He may command me as my king, but you still have power over me as a relative.
Master, do you really mean that?
Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too late.
Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice.
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up.
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again, and I’ll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble.
We want answers.
But if the cause is not just, the king himself will have a lot to answer for, when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying, “We died at such and such a place.” Some will be swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some for the wives that are destitute without them, some about the debts they owed, some for their children left unprovided for.
Unless I am mistaken, Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa, where we both stayed twenty years ago.
Please spare my innocent wife and children!—Kind warden, please stay with me for a while.
A crow without feathers?
To supper?
This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors.
Let thunder flatten the spherical world, crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings, and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow!
That’s my sister.
Men who risk everything hope to make profits.
I am unfit to rule and to be king.
That’s how it was with Henry the Sixth, who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old.
She and Susan—God rest her and all Christian souls—were born on the same day.
I’m as good a gentleman as the emperor.
I wish we had a signed legal contract.
Here’s my key.
A friend.
You can figure out the rest.
Ha!
Only you would look for a fight like that.
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt?
His virtue is not hidden.
She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover, and now that she’s getting married to Theseus, you’ve come to celebrate their marriage.
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
The Moor himself is still at sea.
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
Sometimes snakes wrap around me, hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy.
Where’s that snake?
I’ve practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you, but I still couldn’t bear this news like you do.
And all my children?
I cannot blame you now for weeping.
But his investments are uncertain right now.
Yes, I swear.
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke.
Give me Bianca for my inheritance.
And he told us to follow him to the temple.
Demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you.
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad.
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud, showy ferocity, too, leaving their brains behind with their wives.
You’re hitting close to home there.
All ladies love me, except you.
She  I can guess her answer.
I am willing to fight you if I must.
Answer that question.
But as of right this second all these things are yours.
I know him well.
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: if you can’t change something, don’t cry about it.
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia.
Well, I’ll get married one day, just to see.
Don’t pardon that.
I’m hoping my holy mood will pass.
You seasoned his food with screams.
Tell me what you are.
Come, tailor, show it to us.
Oh, wait, sir.
Oh, I wish you’d never been born!
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here.
I could marry you there, gentle Hermia, where the strict laws of Athens can’t touch us.
In just an hour from now, Duchess of York, I’ll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens.
Very near, and approaching fast.
Goodbye to my happiness!
I, sir, am Dromio.
Or else their guardians and advisors said no— What hell, to have your love life determined by someone else!
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him, as it does this good king’s blood.
Along with this strange power, he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities.
Let’s go find him and cheer him up.
I wish I could work for that lady!
Oh, say it, and mean it!
Well, Juliet, I’ll lie with you tonight.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.”
This is a majestic and harmonious vision.
Do you hear me?
Claudio?
You’re snoring, but it sounds like you’re talking.
My lady, will you have a dance with me?
No, taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it.
I’ll go get Beatrice for you, who can walk here by herself—she has legs.
How are you?
What’s she trying to say?
Look, here she comes!
You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower.
He’s alive and victorious, and Mercutio’s dead?
What’s going on?
Where is Gloucester?
Should be?
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
Therefore, you should obey their wishes.
I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said, Launcelot.
That braggart, punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual!
Yes.
My husband!
Why, our troops amount to three times that.
Why stay when love tells you to go?
Fortune is happy today and, in this mood, will give us anything we want.
Dromio?
No, noble Romeo, you’ve got to dance.
They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food.
But you, my noble lords, may name a time, and I’ll second it on the duke’s behalf, which I don’t think he’ll mind.
I swear, you speak the truth.
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms!
A jealous woman, a jealous woman!
You can see how it is all around.
I say “force” because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this.
No one shows mercy because he has to.
If you like, you can rest a while in my room.
Pass the order along.
Don’t say anything.
I won’t have one any bigger.
Have I lost my wit?
I have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people.
I’m glad.
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life.
Oh painful day, Oh painful day!
I’m not competitive like Antony.
He’s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour.
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat.
I’ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors.
Sir, Octavius has already arrived in Rome.
Are you scared?
I took your hands in friendship, but, indeed, I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar.
And since I wooed her in your name, I’ll join you in disgracing her.
Any trick that works is good for me.
Within three hours Juliet will wake up.
He’ll stay as long as I say.
My lord, I know what I’m saying.
Oh, look, sir, look, sir!
Good—here’s the stretcher.
Now, before God, our whole city owes this friar a great debt.
She hangs around me all the time.
Well, do your best.
Yes, that’s for sure.
We charge you, in the Prince’s name, to stop!
Is this the family tomb of Leonato?
Well, well.
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can’t stand?
Leave them alone, and do the murder first.
Benedick, Beatrice praised your wit the other day.
What!
It’s almost four.
Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me.
Will my daughter be a good musician, do you think?
Don’t worry about me.
I will, my lord.
Now Margaret’s curse has fallen on our heads, for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son.
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose.
Someone else has the same name, but he’s a better man.
There she is.
Oh ho, is that what you’re getting at?
Give him this letter.
I don’t want anything but that.
I don’t understand why they’re all here together.
That’s as good as proof that the sweet young man’s in love.
Good afternoon, fair lady.
Are you that impatient?
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood.
Yes, madam, but he’ll be back tonight.
What, you?
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes.
Here comes his Majesty.
If I could make things better by lying, I’d deny it.
I’m telling you, just watch his face.
For standing up for this unpopular king.
What will this do?
I’ll smear my face with filth, put on a loincloth, make my hair matted and tangled, and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing.
Help!
Me too—otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio.
Is it lunchtime?
I didn’t do anything.
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, I arrest you for high treason.
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you.
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy.
What a backward world we live in!
Let it all go.
Our noblemen are battling bravely.
Come, let’s continue on toward your father’s house.
Yes, boy.
Who offered him the crown?
But please tell me, who’s his best friend?
If you’re going to die, be quick about it so you can catch the king’s departing soul or follow him, like obedient subjects, to his new kingdom of endless night.
Don’t come in here, uncle!
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home.
If I decide to get angry at you, just watch out— You’d be done for then, monster.
Where are the evil men who started this fight?
Captain Fluellen!
Come, firebrands, over here!
What’s wrong, cousin?
I’m not coming.
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it.
If they aren’t, they can go hang themselves by their own laces!
These times of pain are bad times for romance.
Fast work and a little luck are all I need.—Brother, could I have a word with you?
Oh, dainty duck!
This is just what the letter said.
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester, where, if you’d like, we can retreat to.
Yes, and he’s been carried off the field.
It’s almost ten o'clock.
She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband.
Adieu.
I have a daughter named Katherina, sir.
But not the woman who scolds, anyway, I hope.
Just you wait.
Bring out the stocks!
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio.
My Cordelia, even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me.
It’s a play about ten words long, which is the shortest play I’ve ever heard of.
It’s true.
Yes.
If luck’s with me, I’ll lose a father, and you’ll lose a daughter.
What symptoms, my lord?
A gentleman.
What are you doing here alone?
No, not tonight.
I’ll give it a try.
I’m not afraid of dead uncles.
When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better.
Let’s say I didn’t kill them.
Where are the thousand 
No, you should tell him to hold his hands!
What do you want?
What’s going on, daughter?
Brother, hey!
I won’t listen to you.
The French have retreated, see, and there were great acts of courage.
Who’s that?
Signed, she who would be your servant,     The Fortunate Unhappy.” This is as clear as sunlight in an open field.
Will you be my husband, then?
Listen to my excuse.
Farewell, King.
And there’s no need for wonder or worry.
I’m tired of this moon.
But I’ll marry you under different circumstances—with extravagant festivals, public festivities, and celebration.
Signior Benedick served well in the war, my lady.
That’s what I intend to do too.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman.
What kind of help do you need?
Are you ill?
It’s nine o'clock.
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples?
Just the weathervane moving.
This is unbelievable!
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other, in the ordinary and equal clash of battle?
And what would you give me for the handkerchief?
I know the sound of his walk.—Die, villain!
If you have me, you have me now at my worst; and if you have me, you’ll appreciate me better and better.
My name is Hortensio, sir.
This contract doesn’t give you any blood at all.
I have walked around the streets, exposing myself to the perilous night, unbuttoned like this, as you see, Casca, baring my chest to the thunderbolt.
We’re off to eat and whoop it up at your father’s house.
And look how he’s repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty—penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter.
The food inside is warm, but you’re out here freezing.
Come on, let’s go at it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries, 'Stop!
We will watch the execution.
Lovell, go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw.
I’ll meet you at your tent.
No more talk about killing yourself, okay?
What infinite peace do king’s give up that private men enjoy?
Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for.
It’s only for your willing and receptive ear.
She speaks my language!
Oh, for Pete’s sake!
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening, but for now he has no fangs.
You have broken my heart.
Yes, ma'am.
He acts like a man in love.
That’s the necklace I gave you, sir.
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs.
I don’t see any Thisbe.
We have to get out of here, old man.
I’m going to make sure I stay on your good side, lady.
But since you’re his scoundrel servant, I will.
Don’t try to tempt me!
How would you woo her?
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful.
Then Antony offered it to him again, and he refused it again (though, in my opinion, he was reluctant to take his hand off it).
No one, Brutus, no one.
Let me embrace you.
My grandmother told me he was murdered there.
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master’s?
Where have you sent the king?
I’m telling the truth.
Even  What, were you all snarling before I arrived, ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs, but now that I’m here, you turn your hatred toward me?
What do you think about this change?
Go to your bedroom.
God help Claudio!
The thane of Fife had a wife.
There’s other work for you to do.
I work for Titania, the Fairy Queen, and organize fairy dances for her in the grass.
The change will be recorded as a precedent, and many bad legal decisions will result.
Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs.
How can Caesar be a tyrant then?
Yes, indeed, it was, and he pushed it away three times, each time more gently than the last; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted.
But even so, I’ll make doubly sure.
jailer, i’m your prisoner.
Where are they?
I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others.
Be quiet for a while.—Robin, take off his donkey head.—Titania, get the fairies to play some music, and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before.
So that she may live, I’ll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child.
It wouldn’t surprise me, my lord.
I think someone’s coming from Venice.
Well, her name’s a word, and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore.
Women are made for 
Isn’t he here?
You know from my clothing who I am.
That’s for sure.
I hope to God Othello’s all right.
He’s definitely the most active gentleman of France.
Check the calendar and come tell me.
Say something.
What do you want to tell me?
I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, but look how drunk I am.
I don’t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him, I still want to speak to him.
I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.
A drunkard or a corpse?
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it.
Let me see Philostrate.
Play me some music.
I’ve come to take you to the senate house.
Don’t follow me.
Make him think you’re Sir Topas the priest.
And how did you get in here?
Is he dead?
A reason?
Do you really think I’m no stronger than the rest of my sex, with such a father and such a husband?
You can’t get any more money out of me right now.
I am a villain.
Stand close together, in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to— Don’t talk about standing together.—Publius, cheer up.
Count how many times the clock chimes.
Or should we enter without apologizing?
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm, but I’ve come out here to find you and take you where there’s warmth and food.
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right, deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him.
I may command the one I love.” Well, she commands me.
Sir, that’s well said and well thought out.
Too bad about the son!
I’m here, sir.
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes?
I took good care of you—piece of filth that you are—and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter.
When she takes a sip, I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck.
Are you sure of that?
Speak.
You may hear about it soon.
I’ll be there shortly.
What?
Stop, even if only to kill me.
I’ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face.
My master’s house.
Please don’t tell me any more.
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you.
Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it, we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass, to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures.
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners!
Look how they kiss and carry on!
The whole world wants her.
If we lose this battle, this is the last time we’ll speak to each other.
They’re good enough to drink in, and so are these boots.
Please, keep it to yourself.
These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear.
I think that’s strange.
Good and noble young man, don’t mess with someone who’s desperate.
Get up early tomorrow—at the sound of the lark—noble Norfolk.
Help!
What’s new with you?
Once we have covered the two servants with blood, and used their daggers to kill, won’t people believe that they were the culprits?
Here, sir!
Should we do that?
Since you’re letting me leave, I’ll hurry.
I know all of this.
I’ll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of.
Oh, blessed, blessed night!
Well, may peace be with you.
Robin Starveling, the tailor?
I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world.
With the help of the grim  The first to greet me there was my great 
Where is my Romeo?
Yes, they are.
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition.
Your heart’s going to break.
What, are you hurt?
Take out your sword.
My lord, he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day.
No, I’m not wound up.
I wish you could face your bad news like a man!
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare.
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there.
I wish you were what I wanted you to be!
Where is Lucentio?
Am I that name, Iago?
Bandage my wounds!
Gone, sir.
Why, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year.
The candle is burning in your study, sir.
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her!
So did I.
Let’s embrace 
Oh, that’s disgusting!
Follow me.
Yes, I remember.
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland?
But gentle heavens, don’t keep me waiting.
You don’t know what money can buy.
He was dressed so oddly too!
He looks skinny, like a dried herring without its eggs, and he hasn’t got his girl.
I’ll go and join my men.
But who’s coming?
Bad times?
I’ll be there early.
Yes, right now.
You don’t know me.
Is the worst well?
Not by the likes of you!
I’ll test it out.
And as long as she’s herself—wise, beautiful, and faithful—she’ll always have a place in my heart.
honor you.
We can’t all be masters, and not all masters should be followed.
No, he comes to be married  Lady, do you come here to be married to this count?
I’ll bleed to death.
What, are you mocking me to my face?
I’ll cross myself.
I think they do.
My noble kinsman, welcome.
I’ll kiss your hand, and with that I leave you.
That’s excellent.
For three months.
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love.
I hope you’ll be a good father to me now.
Why, he’s the Prince’s fool, and a very dull fool at that.
There must be something in the air here.
These were sweet omens!
These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they don’t predict my future.
You’ve never seen anything like it.
Well, I’m glad about this.
I’ll make him tell me the whole story again—where, how often, how long ago—and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future.
This is a miracle, if you talk of miracles.
You may, sir.
His courage is hidden, and when it is revealed, it will shrink.
I’m Lorenzo, your love.
This is old Ninny’s tomb.
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people!
I’ve been so tortured since I lost track of you!
Your mother.
We’ll be your witnesses.
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman, or why wouldn’t he be here?
Dear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers, please put an end to it.
Ate at home?
Say something, man!
Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early.
Do you make your living by playing that drum?
Well, go along now.
What did I promise, my dear?
Farewell, everyone.
Wait, Petruchio, I should go with you.
With my eye sockets?
I love rich Capulet’s daughter.
I’m ordering you, go home.
Yes, boy.
Sir, my brother is very fond of you.
Hello to you too, sir.
How is your Highness?
He started it, my noble lord, and succeeding generations rebuilt it.
We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room.
Where’s the evidence against me?
I am glad he’s coming, however he’s dressed.
That will please God, who has him now.
Come over here, nurse.
He’s coming, ma'am.
I’m very glad about that.
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small.
You should always be honest.
Yes, that’s why you have to die.
Renowned duke, please join us in the abbey, where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us.
I have more news too.
Peter!
But please tell me more.
I think I hear the drums far away.
There they go, Silver!
If you don’t, if I’m left alone, I swear I’ll have that legal expert as my bedfellow.
Made it for me?
So let’s see it.
There’s no other way.
But so what?
Seyton!
I’m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash.
The one who makes her queen, of course.
You can do what you want, but he’s an experienced and honorable soldier.
Oh, there’s my lady!
Shame of what, lady?
That’s enough.
It’s born of my  A witty mother!
By running fast.
I’ll go and chat with Paris.
I have a pretty good ear for music.
My thanes and kinsmen, I name you all earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had.
Her once-trimmed hedges, like prisoners with wild, untended hair, put forth unruly twigs.
That since she’s mad herself, she’s married a madman.
There are parents living whose children you have butchered; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old.
His love is blind, so it belongs in the dark.
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better?
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl.
I’ve transferred Richard’s body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood.
Then if we lose this battle, you’ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome?
Didn’t feel like it?
It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves.
We’re absolutely not here to delight you.
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you?
Let’s do that, Lysander.
Please, I’m asking you, go ahead and get back to your state affairs.
Truly, lady, you have a merry heart.
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did?
Call the priest.
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard.
I need to get Othello’s things from the ship.
Helena, we’ll tell you about our secret plan.
Give me my armor.
Where’s your sparkle now?
A man of great influence.
Oh, my dear mistress, I won’t be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest.
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey.
And what did Surrey say to that?
My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes!
And bring the ship’s captain to the castle.
I will, my lady, but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy.
This madman will murder me.
I defy brain-death!
And so will I.
Maybe, but I wish I’d never laid eyes on him.
Lucius!
Do you mean the king?
Even their clothes are unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.
What money, sir?
Now, though, in all of Rome, there’s room for only one man.
Just watch!
Go get me something I can use to break down the door.
Get lost, will you?
Get up.
That’s him, that villain Romeo.
You told me to do the same, my liege.
All that glitters is not gold— You’ve often heard that said.
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio’s life?
Tell me, how is my mother?
Are you speaking from your heart?
Didn’t this frighten our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
How are you, madam?
I think Belman is just as good, my lord.
What, are you moaning on about your toothache?
So let me hear what you have to say.
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian, as I asked you to do?
Beautifully, sir, beautifully!
The gates of mercy will be closed by then, and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers, who have tasted blood, will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want, mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants.
Word is that Richmond is the navy’s admiral.
Block up my house’s ears—I mean the windows.
Tell me, Captain Macmorris, have you left the tunnels?
Well sir, they’ve lied; moreover, they have said things that were not true; secondarily, they are slanderers; sixth and lastly, they have falsely accused a lady; thirdly, they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen; and, in conclusion, they are lying scoundrels.
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is.
I won’t deny you anything!
There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his bravery, and death for his ambition.
No, he’s a devil—a devil, I tell you!
I think it’s my bad eyesight that’s making me see this horrible vision.
Cassius, don’t take it badly.
She’s not good enough for you, then.
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and repented deeply.
They 
Call to him, Mercutio.
I’m being gentle with you, because I’m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself.
Is that possible?
Come on, you’re being ridiculous!
She’ll be damned for it.
They both begin with the letter “R.” Ah, you jokester—that’s the dog’s name.
If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt.
What’s the matter?
I’ll follow in the center of the troop formation, which I’ll defend with my best horse, and with Saint George on my side, as well!
I’ll take responsibility for that.
Why do you ask?
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you, for the sake of his honor.
I think I’ve found one already, thanks to you, my lord.
To Brutus’s, to Cassius’s, let’s burn them all.
Sir, he may still be alive.
I can see what’s in broad daylight.
The more I hate him, the more he follows me around.
Oh, how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up Caesar himself!
Where did you learn that song, Fool?
Stay near me so I’ll remember.
Please!
I can’t tell who’s who.
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him.
Here in the tent.
Please tell me, who is this man?
Why Dover?
I won’t betray them.
Yes, Shylock, I’ll sign the contract and agree to its terms.
But Lysander’s so attractive that he’s turned heaven into hell!
Have the excavators stopped work?
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring.
Then you really are insane, if you’re no saner than a fool.
I’m the king himself.
So, possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery, I can’t awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness.
God defend and guard us innocents against them!
As a favor to  I’m delighted.
Now, tell me—which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first?
Who’s there, in the other devil’s name?
Why are you talking to me like this?
I’m bleeding, but you didn’t kill me.
If you can’t do it, be grateful you’ve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin, if it comes to that.—Harder, men!—Now get out of our way, I’m telling you.
To tell you that you’ll see me at Philippi.
All right, I understand.
In Algiers, sir.
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me, I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself.
What kind of crude jerk are you?
And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.
Stop advising me; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve.
Is that how it is, countrymen?
Women are sex machines below the waist, though they’re chaste up above.
My lord the ruler of Burgundy, I’ll speak to you first.
Oh God of battles, bolster my soldiers' courage.
I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation.
I’ve told you everything I know.
Your brother’s right-hand man.
No, no, no, no!
That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to.
Wasn’t he born from a woman?
God keep me so.—Heralds, go with him.
Let me work on him.
Did you hit your head?
It takes a wise father to know his own child.
Come on, let’s put him in a dark room and tie him up.
I’d endure it until he came home again.
I’ll stay in Messina until you’re married, and then I’ll go to Aragon.
You’ve got something for me?
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners, or because you’re just stupid?
Nothing.
Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island.
Oh my!
Asses are made for bearing, and so are you.
He’s eager to see your head.
If I live to see you get married someday, all my wishes will come true.
I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona.
What do you call this?
Me, a penny?
I’ll listen to Cassius, and we will compare their reasons.
Wait, Tybalt, wait!
The rooster has already crowed twice.
Tom’s chilly.
My beautiful warrior!
I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about.
You old traitor, repent all your sins.
Prince Dauphin, you’ll stay with me in Rouen.
Become a better
Well, he’s alive.
That’s music to my ears.
Oh no!
We’re unprepared for this wedding celebration.
Put it together with something else.
Did you see him?
When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn’t feature more than one famous man?
That’s true.
A backbiting friend, one who grabs people, who patrols the streets and passageways.
Who’s she?
Go on, wear your boots out!
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries.
As sure as I’m standing here, I saw him.
Write down that Prince John is a villain.
Amen.
I’m sorry, my friend.
I’ll never see my gold again.
No, I won’t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt.
Why don’t you go away for a bit?
This is all quite pleasant.
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing.
They say the horses ate each other.
Sit down, worthy friends.
No, he did not.
Put on your nightgown.
To find a husband for her sister.
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn’t want to be a Roman?
Oh, heaven, how did she get out?
By God, I’ll go after him again and beat him up.
Absolutely everything.
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them!
As the sonnet says, “If you please one special person, you please everyone who matters.” Why, what’s going on?
Here, Peter Quince.
Who put my servant in the stocks?
It goes along with being born to greatness, but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about.
You’re on your deathbed.
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him.
The boy was going to support me in my old age!
I don’t think any woman like that exists.
My own house, good lady.
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it.
Well, no, not literally.
Tortured, 
She can’t possibly have done you any wrong.
Yes, I am the one.
Come, lady; you must die in order to live.
I’m sure of that.
You’ll introduce me to him as a eunuch.
My dear Gloucester!
Who’s this?
Kent, if you want to stay alive, stop talking.
Have you heard any news of impending battle?
Catch me if you can!
A man named Iago, the general’s ensign.
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs?
We heard it very clearly.
Were you here when it started?
Because of your advice and your help, I have a high position now.
Goodbye.
If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it.
Isn’t she proud of such a match?
Punish me if it’s not true.
Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you.
Oh Banquo, Banquo, the king has been murdered!
I’ve been tricked.
He is.
From my house, if I had a house—” “The sixth of July.
I won’t.
Sit down and rest.
Ah, here she comes, angry and sad.
I think he’ll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple.
I pray that the mighty gods defend you!
I hope with all my heart she will!
There’s something going on that’s not what it seems.
All right!” It’s not fine, and I’m not all right!
What, in our own house?
What a lying, drunken monster.
Why are your swords out?
Yes, his chest!
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don’t like them?
God, help us not be jealous!
Please give me that.
You may think that I don’t love you.
God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive.
Nobody’s coming?
As
I never saw my father in my life.
When you ask for my blessing, I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me.
No money, I swear.
That light we see is coming from my hall.
Where are you going?
Really, he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice.
Does Leonato have a son, my lord?
Othello isn’t any of those things.
Bellario sends his greetings.    
Whose tongue?
Even if I had sworn never to marry, I wouldn’t trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me.
I told him you were asleep.
A conclusion, a conclusion: he is in love.
Poison, I see, has been the cause of his death.
Yes.
You’ve stained your virtue with your own actions.
I’ll put her on that.
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him.
Let’s go, Nerissa.—
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me.
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other.
I’m amazed you got here before me.
Gave me, sir?
I’d give up my life and take my son’s place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples.—When did you lose your daughter?
You know me well.
He begs you to spare his life.
No, what provoked you was your own bloody mind, which never thinks about anything but butchering.
If God will be revenged for this deed, he will do it publicly.
I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods.
But didn’t you expect us to cut the cloth?
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France.
Here it is.
Tyrrel, come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths.
I have no doubt that you love me.
And Walter couldn’t get his dagger out of its sheath.
The smell of leek turns my stomach.
Go ahead, Moon.
Carthage?
I’m sorry.
From now on this is what I’ll think of your love.
I was born as free as Caesar.
Why did I come here if not for that?
Ah, where’s my servant?—Give me some brandy.—These griefs, these pains, these sorrows make me old.
This bigmouth jerk here—( He’ll still die by hanging, not drowning, even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him.
Cobweb.
Oh, good, a knife!
But if she can’t love you, sir?
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse.
Just say “Yes” and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye.
Yes, with Cassio.
Your friends at Pomfret, they’re the ones who need a priest.
My husband will save me.
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me.” Oh, how monstrously evil!
I swear I’m not lying.
But let him start off easy by killing one of us.
Jesus, let’s kill him!
Oh bloody Richard!
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him.
That’s all there is to say.
They’re entirely welcome.
Would I ever deny you anything?
And if your clothes were as thin as mine, you’d really feel the air.
I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over!
We’ll see them immediately.
We can’t go on with this plan.
What, in my presence?
Oh, she’s slow!
Go find those herbs for him, before his madness puts his life in danger.
No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they’re not much to speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare.
Will you go hide?
But to tell you the truth, reason and love have very little to do with each other these days.
When devoutly religious men are praying, it’s hard to draw them out of it, because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation.
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows; it is a charitable duty my order performs.
Don’t forget the vows we made to each other.
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king.
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace, that they seek authority, supremacy, and power when they are under an obligation to serve, love, and obey.
Go back with her?
I didn’t survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now.
The king’s in bed.
Haven’t I resisted even Brutus, begging from his knees?
Well, the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer.
Listen, will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn?
It’s strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger.
But I’m still afraid.
Portia is dead.
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy.
The more I love him, the more he hates me.
Good riddance!—Close the curtains and leave.—I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice.
Is it possible to be wise, bewildered, calm, furious, loyal, and neutral all at once?
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears?
I don’t mean that she wants me because  What’s she like?
Watch Cassius.
I’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can’t have.
This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior.
I didn’t say anything.
Hot, hot and moist.
Call in my maid.
Delighted to stay?
Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to restrain myself.
I’ll read it aloud.
You have impatience all over your face.
How can it seem like I’m making fun of you, when my tears prove that I’m sincere?
I don’t know what you mean by that, but I’m sure Caesar fell down.
It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side.
Oh, Sir Toby, stop!
Sir, be a man.
Look, here I have Macbeth’s cursed head.
I love you so much that I’ll send your soul to heaven very soon—if heaven will accept anything from me, that is.
I’m Christopher Sly, son of old Sly of Barton-on-Heath, a peddler by birth, a  Oh, this is why your poor wife is mourning!
Thank you.
Will you let me?
I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for loving her, my student.
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman.
Farewell to both of you, dear teachers.
If you wish to speak of love, speak more softly.
These revelations have overwhelmed her.
The two of them were separated during the storm.
But Antonio’s certainly ruined.
The letters he spoke of may help me.
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven.
That’s not your fault!
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands.
You’ll be my wife, dearest, and I’ll serve you forever.
Yes, and the best looking too.
Get out of here, my friend.
I’ll ask only Benedick to come with me, for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he’s a joker.
Good gentlemen, look like you’re rested and happy.
Until that happens, let me be who I am and don’t try to change me.
But there was a rumor—you know, people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia.
You couldn’t see him, but I could.
What are you doing, old man?
I’m hoping for better.
Sir, I make my living using an awl.
I’m an honest Puck, and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at, we’ll make it up to you soon.
Should I tell you why?
We’ll rise and leave early tomorrow.
It’s clear, every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death.
Therefore, when he has reason to fear, as we do, his fears are without question of the same order.
Get it, sister.
How can this drama be so many contradictory things?
In every good thing they do.
Thanks for that.
I’ll look at him and try to like him, at least if what I see is likable.
Poor Tom, your cup is empty.
Shall I be tempted by the devil?
Victory is with us.
I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up.
Let me take my chances.
But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer.
First, Peter Quince, tell us what the play is about, then read the names of the actors, and then shut up.
But tell me, Egeus.
Don’t worry about me.
He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it.
If I owe you anything, I’ll pay you in clubbings.
She can’t deny it.
I heard the news, my lord.
Sir, I tell you we believe you’re both lying criminals.
Oh, how wonderful to see you!
No, my lord, not me.
Bring him in front of me.
Ha!
Fool!
Now, noble Buckingham, seal this alliance by embracing my wife’s friends, and make me happy in your unity.
So, where should we eat? 
Sadness over my son’s exile stopped her breath.
Was a man ever as dirty as me?
Her bottom.
Oh my, my bones ache so much.
I did.
Please, all of you, stand up.
Go ahead and ask her.
Oh!
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak.
Don’t worry, I’ll be there.
What do you say, your Highness, about my just request?
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged?
She’s crying.
Speak.
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
I hope to God I’m proven wrong!
That’s true—if the devil’s judging her.
This is your job.
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this, then.
So you’re saying you’re not a whore?
Good advice, indeed.
It’s expressly against the rules of combat.
As I remember, this should be the house.
How could so many people, under two masters, get along under one roof?
Mine wasn’t wearing a bridle.
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons.
What?
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother?
It’s often the case that having something makes us spoiled, while not having it turns out to be advantageous.
What in the world do you call this, tailor!
He and I will be there.
She’s desperate.
If you don’t repay me on the day we agree on, in the place we name, for the sum of money fixed in our contract, your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh, to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like.
Well, good luck!
I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now.
Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?
Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him?
He lost both, my lord.—Ma'am, this letter is from your sister, and needs an immediate answer.  
What do you want?
Exactly how long is that, do you think?
May heaven bless you.
And I’ll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn.
Look, here he comes.
But where is my love?
Well, should we hear some music?
Listen up, you slave.
I like doing things the old-fashioned way.
No, don’t.
Just looking at him gives me heartburn.
Oh, please be true, please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you, my dear brother!
I don’t know.
Rust inside my body and let me die.
That you lift the death sentence on my servant, who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk.
She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me.
His words are like poison to me.
Oh, that’s very nice!
Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?
No one will listen to it.
What villain, madam?
No, really, I’m not.
Treat me well.
I’m always happy to hear about brave men.
Oh, Regan, Goneril, your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything—Oh, if I think about that I’ll go mad.
No.
So I won’t choose what many men desire, because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population.
Let’s go, Tom.
You look tired.
If he’s reluctant, I can convince him.
What’s your name?
Sure I can, father.
I curse her.
I know it’s the sun that shines so bright.
But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.
Were these things we’re talking about really here?
She can’t even imagine what “love” is.
If you see anything else, let me know.
Can you feel your legs?
What I think about this, and about what’s happening here in Rome, I’ll tell you later.
And that’s true—he  Then I pleaded for you.
Well then, don’t bother.
But I can’t be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother, young George.
My spirit friend, Harpier, is yelling, “It’s time, it’s time!” Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails.
When will we get to the top of that cliff?
A fair woman!
He rode that prologue like a wild horse.
Madam, you’ve treated me badly, very badly.
He hasn’t told this to the king, has he?
We’ll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry, and we’ll mock him till he’s black and blue.
The reason I think he’s insane, besides the way he just acted, is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house.
Trinculo, if you interrupt him any more, I swear I’ll knock some teeth out of your head.
How are you?
I think I’m getting delirious.
I’m still young enough to see without glasses, and I don’t see what you’re talking about.
Lucentio, sir.
Run off, go visit fairs and festivals!
Inside, sir, with the earl.
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused.
And there’s nothing I can do about it.
You told me you hated him.
Why, Fool?
What’s new, cousin Lodovico?
Stay here.
Oh, you villain!
The wisdom of your loyalty, fair Bianca, has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner.
He was my friend, he was faithful and just to me.
Sweet Hero; when I imagine you now, you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you.
Were you talking about Juliet?
I’ve heard my father mention him.
Why are you adored?
Pindarus, order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground.
Let me see.
You’ll find Beatrice there, talking to Claudio and the Prince.
You’ll see, I promise you.
I won’t sleep until I see her, Hortensio.
You, sir, where’s my daughter?
Monster, I’ll kill this man.
Yes, right away.
Farewell!
Let the rain spray!
Who’s there?
Thank you.
Before you make  My lord, you could really help me out now.
Be quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your mind.
Oh, I don’t know.
Goneril with a white beard?
So prepare to die.
Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love” and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good friend 
After you cast your magic spell on me last time, I sent you a ring.
Should I blab to her that you’re coming?
But how?
What’s the matter?
A spirit?
What an idiotic place this world is.
No, we can just announce the actor’s name, and let his face show through the lion costume, and have him say something himself.
I’m sure you both remember me.
Yes, thoroughly.
I need to speak a word with you.
Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”?
Excellent!
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy.
Tyrant, show your face!
But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.
I’m very sensitive, and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings.
Haven’t you, boy?
If you were king, we would do the same.
Alright, let’s fight, boy!
I meant a crowbar.
Be convincing.
No harm was done.
Do they seem religious?
Oh, good judge!
What is a traitor?
Why would she write to Edmund?
I’ll never believe a madman until I can see his brains.
Why do you look like that?
You seem like a good judge.
Yes, I’ll grant you that.
He’s so flighty in his old age, as we keep noticing.
Really, are you afraid of that?
If I had seen something like that, I would have quickly pulled out my weapon.
Caesar’s talking.
I meant to say the Lord Protector.
If it’s the same one— If it’s the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong.
Be quiet, people!
Those of you who are young and active, I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do.
Mistress, you know about that.
What are you doing?
You haven’t got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do.
This poor guy’s partly confessed his plan.
But no more spooky visions!—Where are the messengers?
My body waits here, but the rest of me is gone.
It’s a measly little cap, a dessert crust, a plaything, a silk pie.
Here, Peter Quince.
Look, here come two noble animals, a man and a lion.
Then keep your vow, fellow, when you meet the man.
Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed, and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do.
Wish I could say the same.
With the permission of Brutus and the others—for Brutus is an honorable man; they are all honorable men—I have come here to speak at Caesar’s funeral.
The Lord Grandpré.
Come on, can I get you two to make up?
He did touch on women a bit, but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon.
Yes, but who is he?
Master, I’m all tied up for you.
No, sir.
You may leave.
Do something about it, then.
Well, I’m not sorry to hear that, because they have always been my enemies.
No, no, until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a dream we had.
The war’s over and the Turks are drowned.
I should sit in the corner and sing that song, “Heigh-Ho for a Husband!” Lady Beatrice, I’ll get you a husband.
I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word.
Put
That your interest payments are like Jacob’s sheep?
A very clear way, but there is no friend who will undertake it.
Well, first of all, my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out.
But try to control your speech.
Welcome to Cyprus.
I’ve told her father, and he’s given his permission.
And I see her also through the eyes of love.
The ground is bloody.
It’s pointless to talk now.
Why, sir, he’s not coming.
If he has a face like yours, a good scratching couldn’t make him look any worse.
That’s good advice.
Why do I have to do that?
I’ll tell you what to do.
You’re getting in the way of our work.
If I were your average fool, or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody, or if you’d seen me first flattering men, hugging them tightly, and later slandering them behind their backs, or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble, only then, of course, go ahead and assume I’m dangerous.
And after that he came back here looking so serious?
Won’t he?
Do as you please, because I’m done worrying about you.
Well, whose is it?
My lord, your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp.
No, you have to forget all that now.
But don’t be easily won over.
I haven’t seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
When will he be here?
You’ve wronged Caius Ligarius.
I got this purse full of money from you, and my Dromio brought it to me.
Knock, knock!
If not, to tell you I will die is true, but not for love, by God.
There must be some resolution.
Then pack up your instruments and go away.
That’s the way it goes.
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don’t drown yourself!
Take away this fool, gentlemen.
And when I’ve sneaked up on my sons-in-law, then I’ll kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
How are things now?
Brutus, what will we do?
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs.
That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope you’ll do the same.
Ask her to help you get back your position.
If you want to see your deceiver, then look at me.
I don’t want her.
If you leave like this, my dear, I won’t ever use my sword again.
Oh, how strange!
Madam, Count Orsino’s young messenger has returned.
How are you, Roderigo?
Me neither.
Snap out of your daze.
Why, she’s a lamb, a dove, a child compared to him!
His life was gentle, and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world, “This was a man.” Let’s treat him according to his virtue, with all the respect and rituals of burial.
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him?
What do you think I’ve got on my head?
They’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother.
Good spirit!
I have no more royal sons for you to murder.
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th.
Stephano!
I will.
That’s definitely too old.
What did you say?
So were you.
That’s a stupid thing to say.
And she screamed at me, right?
Who’s in there?
I saw you at Count Orsino’s recently.
with the same accessories.
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable, but I still insist I’ve done everything I could to help you.
I do suffer love, because I love you against my will.
Romeo, are you going to your father’s for lunch?
I understand now.
We’ll keep the lines of communication open between us.
If I were, I wouldn’t need to ask you what happened.
Don’t say that.
But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen.
Where that “sweetheart” said I was her husband!
He did, and I gave it to him.
I don’t think so.
Let’s say goodbye to him.
What have you done?
What strange reason could she have for coming here?
Oh, shut up.
I don’t understand why she’s not locked up.
What?
Hey!
The priest is already there.
Will you kill him then?
I’m afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise!—And you, oh Wall, oh sweet, oh lovely Wall, you stand between her father’s property and mine, you Wall, oh Wall, oh sweet and lovely Wall.
Oh, by this count I’ll be many years older before I see my Romeo again.
Those island-bred skeletons, terrified for their bones, are an offensive sight on the morning field.
You promised to tell me.
But don’t let me keep you from going, Cassius.
I don’t believe it.
Oh, what a long, tedious, exhausting night!
Again!
Yes, I do.
No.
What a farce!
Don’t be offended.
It’s not good for your health, either.
Please Margaret, help me write this poem for Beatrice.
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief.
Call yourself your own sister, because I want you.
But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you.
I’m amazed you’re still talking, Signior Benedick.
Will no one back me up?
Sorry, I’m all stuffed.
Iago, give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice.
What are you, girl?
Well, do whatever you think best.
I’m at your service.
Sir, it’s a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship.
Go to sleep, and listen to us laughing.
But I’ll deliver Sir Andrew’s challenge by word of mouth, describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious, impetuous, and a skilled fighter (he’ll believe me because he’s young).
If I know nothing about pity, that must mean I’m not an animal.
Go after her, go.
I think this country is so kind that if it weren’t for
Romeo, come out.
I wish I could believe you that all was well!
It would be easier to do it in the dark.
And I hope you won’t think badly of me.
Just say it.
What did he say when he regained consciousness?
Let the gods judge me!
Yes, what about it?
I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica.
So come with me.
And there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the prince will be here tonight.
What’s the news?
Good morning, gentlemen.
I know a lady in Venice who’d walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him.
Oh, noble sir!
It’s dangerous to talk about it.
Come to think of it, I thought I felt a scab there.
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it, if you’re willing.
Hurry up and get to your horse.
Defend me, God, both when I’m asleep and when I’m awake.      
Kind gentlemen, I won’t forget the trouble you’ve taken for me whenever I think of this day.
Do you know any, Hero?
You don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word.
That was the limit for me.
Well, take him on up and we’ll try to pull it off.
No more, please.
Your words and actions don’t match up.
Yes, but they don’t see anything.
That’s most appropriate.
You are not as happy as Macbeth, yet much happier.
What do you want from me?
How are things going now?
Do you think they’re married?
Very near, my master.
Why did you send me out, brave Cassius?
Give my compliments to your lady.
What have you done?
My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them.
Oh love!
Everyone can see that, and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now.
I can’t recall where I slept last night.
I’ll follow.
Will he bring his army?
I have to ask you, as a favor, not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right.
Beautiful ladies, please don’t treat me badly.
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute?
Who’s there?
Have I hugged you yet?
Listen they’re howling.
Where’s Publius?
It’s a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal.
So, if all turns out fine, as you say, it’s more than we deserve or I expect.
You and your servant are very funny, sir.
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber.
If he hadn’t, we’d all be embarrassed to look at him.
Yes, for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been married forever.
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance, then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly.
Write to him immediately.
I think that on a night like this, when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn’t make a sound,  On a night like this,  On a night like this,  On a night like this, 
Oh, I’m out of breath from this foolish chase.
Up to the breach, you dogs!
By watching their show, you’ll find out everything you’re likely to know.
I’m sorry to find you like this.
Stand away from the hearse.
My Lord Constable, are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight?
I do.
She says she thinks this is a prank.
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts, you’re the one who gave the order.
If I’m lying, then
Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell.
The guilty speak volumes even when they’re silent.
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon.
I’ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets.
Let’s start.
Please, sir, be quiet.
Tell me, Othello.
I have to stop you, Cimber.
I’m not well.
Where is that poor rash man?
I need a doctor.
It’s revolting!
Let’s go greet him when he lands.
He’s fainted!
Oh, why is this so?
Answer me.
I need to get away from you.
If love plays rough with you, play rough with  Come on, let’s knock and go in.
Nothing, my lord.
Cheer up, Antonio!
It eases the spirit.
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out, presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music.
What is this news about?
The king?
Stay in the dark.
Do I know these men who are with you?
Just tell me what you want me to do, and however hard it is, you’ll see that I’m eager to do it.
I haven’t seen such a promising candidate for your love.
I’m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young, and what he would do now if he weren’t so old.
It’s my men who should call me “lord.” I’m your man, your fellow.
If we lose, what do you plan to do?
Hey, hey!
Sadly, it’s the king that’s missing.
In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she came to love me.
You come with me, uncle of Exeter.
Please give in, sweet Hermia.—And Lysander, stop acting like she’s yours.
This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was once considered an honest man.
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light.
Please listen to me carefully.
Oh, my lord, you once said that lazy weeds grow fast.
I wouldn’t do that for the whole wide world.
You may, Mark Antony.
You don’t know my voice?
Never.
A man’s virtues will always show themselves, and that’s the end of that.
No, uncle, I won’t be married.
Tell me, you villainous lowlife, where are my children?
My countrymen— Silence!
Go bring them here.
That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools.
No, I didn’t, but I did every night for the past year.
They won’t pinch me, frighten me, push me in the mud, or mislead me unless he tells them to.
Didn’t you clearly say “Knock,” “pound,” and “put your fists to work”?
No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half as sharp as your hatred.
My brother’s love, the devil, and my own anger made me do it.
We’re overjoyed to see you sane again.
Where do you come from?
But don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you.
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken!
Now please go in.
Have you come to make confession to this father?
But it’s enough.
That’s what I’m afraid of.
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life.
Hey, open the door!
Eighty ducats in one shot!
It is.
No flattery for him, no sir!
No, no.
Brother, Duke, please have some food.
I hope he’s in love.
The men there won’t give a penny to a lame beggar, but they’ll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit.
Maybe, but you’re wrinkled all the same.
Wasn’t that the best thing to do?
I don’t believe it.
Travelers have never told lies, no matter what the fools at home accuse them of.
Well, I won’t take it any longer.
Why, Fool?
Killing him once is not enough revenge.
I’ll disguise myself in somber robes.
I rely on your virtue to protect me.
Come to think of it, I am feeling sleepy.
Bad people can’t appreciate wisdom or goodness.
If you do, please give it to me, because I need to start learning the lines.
You’re perfect, without a rival in the world, made up of the best qualities of every creature.
It’s a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua.
That’s true.
Hello there, sir!
Ingratitude is always hideous, but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster!
Get out of my sight!
The wound can’t be that bad.
Are you indeed?
What, you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I’m warning you about?
It is.
Today was the day I breathed my first breath.
Tell us.
Do as I told you.
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance, to feed my innocent people.
You don’t wish we had more help from England anymore, cousin?
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing, and the church bells chime—one, two, three.
Since the wall is conscious, it should curse back at him.
Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven, Indulge me, forgive me, and set me free.
He’ll wake you up, I bet.
I know him; he wears a lock of hair.
His spirits are listening to me, but I can’t help cursing him anyway.
Show.
You are too expensive to wear every day.
In that case you should sleep.
Good night.
The reason is that it’s what I want.
He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves?
I know you well.
I don’t feel like going.
Well, let me get back to my choice.
I’ll come see you right away.
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair.
I could do a great job with Hercules, or any other part that requires ranting and raving.
The king is coming.
But gilded tombs contain worms.
What’s this?
Give me a torch.
Richard is looking cheerful today.
Now, as you’re a Roman, tell me the truth.
And yet I do love you.
Please stop turning me around.
It’s wrong for the duke to do this.
It’s my duty, sir.
So let her execute me.
Usually fathers produce children, not the other way around.
Truly, no—no more than is reasonable.
I’ll run, devil.
Sure, I hate her, but I wouldn’t hurt her.
Certainly, your grandmother had a worse match.
It’s as silent as a graveyard here.
You!
This is a guy who’s been praised for his honest bluntness, and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words.
Oh, if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns!
What do you remember?
It’s unbelievable.
I’ll arrest him.
Where is my wife?
How are you doing, Cassio?—Someone bring me a stretcher!
What do you say to that, Malvolio?
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up.
I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun.
This is amazing.
My God, it’s morning.
Go to sleep, and I will wrap my arms around you.
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies.
I am still so faithful, my lord.
Do we have devils on the island?
A million goodbyes to you.
Neighbors and friends, though we don’t have anyone for the bride and bridegroom’s places at the table, you know there’s nothing missing in the feast itself.
Antonio, I married a woman as dear to me as life itself.
The clock struck three.
Listen, Signor Bassanio, there’s nothing to worry about.
Come, Kate, let’s go to bed.
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution.
What is the matter?
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better.
I have the authority to dismiss this court, unless Bellario comes today.
And now that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong.
Oh, my good master!
Her name is Katherina Minola, famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue.
Thirty ships.
That’s a wise idea.
Yes, sir, and I’ll leave when you ask me to.
But the really unbelievable thing is—and this is incredible— As most unbelievable things are.
Oh, he’s acting just like Juliet, just like her.
My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?
Oh, my poor brother!
Show us the way.
Don’t tell me that you’ve heard about this marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to prevent it.
You’re asking me!
It’s strange, strange.
This treachery of yours is like the second 
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her?
If I’m going to sing along with you, I need to know what key you’re singing in.
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy, and may God bless you.  
You’ll be my role model.
Do you like me, Kate?
Yes, good idea; that’s the 
I’ll sleep over here.
Boy!
Be quiet, you mumbling fool!
Why not!
To whom?
You’ll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give me a reason.
Oh, do not wish one more!
You’re a good judge of horsemanship.
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better.
Very pleased to meet you, my lord.
That’s why paintings of Cupid, the god of love, always show him as blind.
What do you want with her, sir?
You  But, uncle, we’re being disrespected.
The gods are fair, and they use our little vices to punish us.
To work as a servant.
Young man, when you wake up, if she’s nearby, beg her to cure your lovesickness.
But don’t be afraid, Cesario.
Farewell.
When should the royal day be?
It’s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up.
Then if they’re negligent, we could control them.
Take a tip from me, then.
A messenger from Lord Stanley.
Look at you!
Didn’t I tell you she was innocent?
How smooth and cool they seem!
Now the only person I love, and believe in, and want to look at, is Helena.
My creditors are getting mean.
This is getting worse and worse!
I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart.
Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am.
I won’t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers.
We’ve got some words of wisdom to mull over.
Oh, that’s with worry.
Goodbye, dear Father.
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I, though they don’t cry for Edward, as I do.
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month.
That’s how sound a man you appeared.
It’s him, it’s him.
I think that our father will leave here tonight.
Let’s not stay here with them.
I don’t know.
I never—oh, what a mistake!—revealed myself to him until half an hour ago, when I was in my armor.
Tomorrow, I’ll let you know what I’ve decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England.
Know the glove!
But if you didn’t know about it, then you were wrong to get mad at us.
Give me your arm.
Monday!
He sees himself in my two eyes, so there’s two of him.
Let’s look in his pockets.
A Roman.
Why, what’s Tybalt’s story?
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince, anger Claudio, ruin Hero, and kill Leonato.
He’s a proper count, that Count Sugarplum, a sweet gentleman, for sure!
Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
He’s late.
I’ll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace.
Please put that log down and rest a while.
Is there any more, or is that it?
I’m critical by nature.
I ask that none of you leave, except myself, until Antony has finished.
And leave us, Publius, in case the people storming us should harm you.
Besides, they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all, a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death.
I think it’s important.
You’re helping the storm, not us.
I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
Tell the hot-headed duke that I… But no, not yet.
What’s the bet?
Yes, I guarantee he won’t drown—even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman.
I’ll meet you there in an hour.
Your threats are no stronger than her whining.—Helena, I love you.
No one here is affected by your curse, because curses are just words with no power.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
A greater gift?
Curse the day this happened, but it did.
What?
He had no patience.
Not yet.” Well, the time has come.
Goodbye, Launcelot.
Say, what’s the trouble?
We’ll have to think about it carefully.
Oh, cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe, or I’ll faint from this deadly news!
I ask too much of you, but you’re always willing.
Come on, I’ll fight you.
I’m sorry, but I memorized what I’m supposed to say here today, and that question isn’t part of the speech I learned.
I remember his face well.
What’s the news with you?
And request that she come here.
It’s nice you’re offering to sacrifice her behind her back.
Will I be married tomorrow morning?
Either the lovers have different social standings—
Capulet, you villain!
I’ll prove with my sword that I’m not scared of you.
Come here, Catesby.
Take these keys and get more spices, Nurse.
I wasn’t invited because they like me.
There’s a time for all things.
He meant he did nothing right for me—which is true, unfortunately.
Just to the Tower—I’m guessing, for the same reason you are: to salute the noble princes who are staying there.
Yes, I truly think He did great good.
Show him and make him grieve.
And yet you say that exile is not death?
Listen.
A nice stool.
Hey!
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well, and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things.
There will be no lecture.
I’d rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots.
Please don’t cry.
He received Caesar’s letters, and he is coming.
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him.
Murder!
Your horn is a foot long, and I’m at least that size.
Tie up his withered old arms.
I bet it’s a challenge.
What a crazy island this is.
Why is that?
It wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard.
Speak, speak.
Oh, I’ve been murdered unfairly!
I didn’t expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore.
So good night to everyone.
It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried.
Did you hear the news that’s going around?
Well, first there was the prince from Naples.
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you.
Thieves!
Quiet!
Please, leave it here.
Trust me, you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck.
My letters say only seventy senators were killed, one being Cicero.
Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent— Look behind you!
I know I ought to obey my husband, but not now.
I shook you and shouted at you, sir.
And they’ve got their swords unsheathed!
Stay there and fortify it well against the French.
And keep yourself hidden, I command you.
I hope that, after I tell you my news, you will think better of me.
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me.
It’s better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety.
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation.
Tell me, how did you get in here?
She’s gone.
We won’t go today—or any day until it’s clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is.  
Let George Stanley die after the battle.
It’s obvious.
I think you’re trustworthy one minute and then not the next.
Goodbye!
I’m afraid it will make you too hot, too.
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house.
I hope those lions stay far away from him.
Doesn’t that sound like true love?
Be bold, and get ready.
She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore.
Her bridegroom is here.
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration!
Maybe you’ll see some little trinket you want to buy.
Sad or happy?
Beware of March 15th.
What’s the problem?
Well, girl, you’re weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive.
Where did they disappear to?
Why are you silent?
Goodness, it’s daylight.
Gentlemen, gentlemen—   Gentlemen, don’t speak.
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man—a tiny spark in a cold body.
Madam, here comes your husband.
Demetrius, I’m ready to fight you as promised.
Good morning, Caesar.
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows.
Where is my husband?
To tell the truth, Gratiano, you’re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset.
I’d bet my life that, as young as you are, you’ve fallen in love with someone.
Then she is well, and nothing is wrong.
Curse you!
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool?
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn’t love you least.
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us.
I don’t know, madam.
Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies.
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles, or rabbits frighten a lion.
What’s the news?
We’re not going to run in our army, Monsieur Monster.
Tell them to slick down their hair, brush their blue coats, and make sure their socks match.
I will leave here for Verona tonight.
No.
This is for your master’s sake, not mine.
Is he right?
Send something along to prove you’re withdrawing the orders.
Are you going to join them?
Everything is gloomy, dark, and dreadful.
No, not for all the world.
I’ll be nearby.
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter.
Hastings and Edward’s children, Rivers and Grey, holy King Henry and your fine son Edward, Vaughan, and all who have died from underhanded, corrupt, fiendish injustice, if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds, enjoy the revenge—laugh at my ruin!
Lovers, it’s time to go to bed.
Poor Tom’s chilly.
There’s certainly not a boy left alive, and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle.
Macbeth!
Really?
Four legs and two voices—a very special monster.
Now I see it’s true.
If she glares, I’ll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew.
I won’t bother you.
The devil inside him is rough, but we can’t treat it roughly.
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark.
Oh, sir, on her nose, which is covered with pimples, sores, and red welts.
No, no, I can’t, really.
Go away!     
But here’s an old, true saying: “If you want to win France, start with Scotland.” For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey, the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and, like the mouse when the cat’s away, destroy more than she can actually eat.
With all my heart.
He says that for Brutus’s sake he finds himself indebted to us all.
Yes, she’s young and tender.
Oh!
Oh, traitors, villains!
This is not the way to win your daughter.
Well said!
It’s a lot to ask of a maiden.
Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian?
Likewise, our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes, and their wounded steeds, ankle-deep in gore, struggle and, raging wildly, stamp on their dead masters with their hooves, killing them a second time.
Yes, sir, we hope so.
Why are you calling him a jerk?
You should know, my loving lord, I’ve heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany, to the earl of Richmond.
Ah, dear Nature, my goddess, listen to me!
Goodbye to you all.
Oh, come on.
You go pale, you stare, and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens.
Oh, sir, the problem goes far deeper than you realize.
He’s dead and rotting in the dirt now.
Our friendship in our schooldays, our childhood innocence?
Yes, sir, I have.
Here comes your father.
Calphurnia!
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?
What, is the man insane?    
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it.
No, sir.
She has the patience of a  I’ll see you hanged on Sunday first!
How are you, sir?
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar, and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination.
We all expect a nice answer from you, Jew.
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man.
I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master.
Well, I don’t.
Don’t let them know fear.
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken.
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence, and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do.
Here comes another group looking for you.
And I am, I am.
I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment.
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea, breasting the high waves.
With a touch of green in it.
I’d rather see you having fun, because we have friends coming who want to have fun.
Who, him?
Antonio’s a good man.
What’s up, my man?
His breath stinks.
We thank your Honor.
It’s a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please.
Give my regards to Hastings, Catesby.
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours?
This is the door.
No, sir.
Your bedroom.
If he said that, then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever.
He wouldn’t get drunk much, since there’s no wine here.
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart—you reveled in my lambs' bloody guts.
Please say no more.
Yes, a thousand times.
That upsets me much more than getting wet.
Can you bring me to him?
Hunting what, Curio?
I say he shall go to prison.
I’ll have nothing to do with you.
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy, then be happy, because I did it.
Oh, I see, you will only part with lightweight presents.
For himself to ruin,” he says.
And you won’t tell me who you are?
Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive.
Claribel, his daughter.
What could I say, my dear?
My leg’s been cut in two.
What are you talking about?
Oh no!
If you fight to protect your wives, your wives will welcome you home as conquerors.
Stop right there!
Your grave is gaping open, and your death is near.
There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn’t been washed off yet.
Let’s get away, Tybalt.
His highness is not well.
Go!
Curse you all, you’re all murderers and traitors!
There must be some mistake, sir.
Why are you leading these men through the streets?
My darling Othello!
Please, dear, calm down.
The voice kept crying, “Sleep no more!” to everyone in the house.
Great happiness!
The enemy approaches with great display.
Bring him my head.
Didn’t he come home last night?
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
Where’s my fool?—Go call my fool and have him come here.
Are all the cups and glasses in their places, the tablecloths laid out—everything in order?
One face, one voice, one way of dressing, but two people!
Actually, their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are.
This clearing will be the stage, and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room.
You both know Banquo was your enemy.
He’s in  They say he cried out against sherry.
Only children are afraid of scary pictures.
Let them last forever.
I put those wedding sheets on your bed, as you asked.
My dear Miss Chat-her-up, I look forward to getting to know you better.
They killed your wife, your children, your servants, anyone they could find.
I think you’re right, sir.
If you’re just insane, then get out of here.
So don’t spend one night away from this house.
Good old lord Gonzalo,” as you call him, is saddest of all, with tears running down his beard.
My wife was killed too?
Look, Lucius, here’s the book I was searching for.
They did want me to tell her, but I persuaded them that, if they truly loved Benedick, they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark.
And I will give you some more.
Romeo cried out, “Stop, my friends.
Caesar?    
Lovers, moan and weep.
Cassio, my lord?
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you’ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb.
Hurry up.
If you refuse to allow me to do so, your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered.
Only three so far?
Oh, the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress?
Are you good at those kinds of things?
Oh, I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek.
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is.
You mean the man who used to be Othello?
What a day this is!
I’ll give  Thank you, darling.
I don’t think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight.
We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday.
I stand here with the law on my side.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
And when I’m king, remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it, which my brother the king used to own.
Ha!
I’m a poor man who’s been humbled by many misfortunes.
They’ll assume that Cicero, with his sound judgment, ordered the actions.
I see you’ve met with the jeweler.
Oh, but I think of him more highly than I say I do—and I wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes.
And I followed him because I loved him.
But his punishment was bitter death.
He did, very sincerely.
Isn’t that the reason you told me all this?
This is Cinna.
But I could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery, virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love.
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy.
Look, here it is.
How are you, my friend?
Forget about him, Jack!
This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s brother, was a villain.
Not for your entire fairy kingdom.—Come, fairies, let’s go.
Give me your hand, Leonato.
But you turn that sun into a shadow.
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house.
Is it on record that he built it, or is it just word of mouth?
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday, at six in the morning, four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday, in the afternoon.
Nurse, will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I’ll need to wear tomorrow?
I hope for my brother’s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor.
Here’s money for you.
What’s your name?
Sir, I believe this piece of trash, Bianca, has something to do with all this trouble.—Hang in there, Cassio.—Come here, bring the light.
I don’t know that, once he knows what I know.
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you.
At Pembroke, or at Harfordwest in Wales.
It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night, but it’s easier to hear well. 
He’s a very proper man.
Oh, lieutenant!
Of course I will.
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon?
Oh, except for the widow Dido?
If you dressed only to stay warm, you wouldn’t need these gorgeous clothes you’re wearing—which don’t keep you warm at all.
Oh, you bloody prison, fatal and threatening to noble lords!
Why do you look so upset?
Good, very good.
I knew Temperance—she was a fine girl.
Somebody’s knocking.
I swear I will never break this promise of love.
If it were, you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I’d sold my farm to buy my crown.
Oh, most bloody sight!
Good night, honest Iago.
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot, who lives with him, is still there?
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and impose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were my own son.
Now please, tell Beatrice to come out.
Very obedient—keep crying.—Concerning this—oh, what fake emotion!—I am being ordered home—Get away from me, I’ll send for you later.—Sir, I’ll obey the order and return to Venice.
Sir, is everyone in your family at home?
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born.
Go to the church: take the priest, the clerk, and some reasonably honest witnesses.
If he did that, it would be a charitable deed to hang him.
They stared at us in confusion.
Oh, my dear Cassio!
Oh, forgive all my sins!
Well, don’t face off with me.
He’s furious because you insulted him, and he has a right to satisfaction.
Good!
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall.
How nice of you!
I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs.
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero.
Don’t imagine that I’ll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains.
And if he advances unopposed, my lord, let us abandon France.
But people often screw things up trying to make them better.
Everything depends on this: either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak.
Oh, what an excellent thing this learning is!
I find you quite gentle.
Take away this body, and do what I say.
I wish I could sleep too—it would stop me from thinking.
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey, a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime.
Like a good doctor.  
As clearly as I see you, my lord.
I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier.
Worse and worse!
No one’s heard from him.
How did my master die, Strato?
These two Antipholuses, who look so alike—and these two Dromios, who seem to have the same face—and her story of being shipwrecked—why, these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident.
Give him my respects, and tell him I’ll definitely be there for dinner, since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal.
If she’s cheated on me, then heaven itself is a fake.
Will you be crowned tomorrow?
All this is comforting news.
I’ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh.
Hmm, let me see:
Madam?
God protect me from these two!
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen.
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town?
Good shining, Moon!—Really, the Moon shines very well.
And here’s another poem, which I stole from my cousin’s pocket—in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick.
What is my nation?
Where’s the gold I gave you?
I have no doubt he got ashore alive.
Come here, captain.
Den it shall also content me.
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant’s heart, to be cut off by him.—But please have mercy.
Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces.
Just read it.
He’s the color of nutmeg.
You’re thinking something.
Yes, this is what love does.
He picked out the letter “G” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “G” will take the throne away from his children.
So I welcome this wind freely.
Why did you cry out in your sleep?
Go, get out of here.
I can’t get that song out of my head tonight.
If you don’t like him you should quit.
I’m reminding your grace what you promised me.
What my lord said I was.
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave—and I think we do—then, countrymen, what else could we possibly need to spur us to action?
Can you hear me?
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio’s happiness will be like medicine to me.
Then heaven have mercy on me.
Lovely Beatrice, I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that.
Listen to me patiently.
Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart.
That’s a good song.
What a painful condition responsibility is.
In order to make your company even more enjoyable, I’m going to keep to myself until suppertime.
Now all my enemies are at my mercy.
Absolutely not.
Well, it doesn’t matter.
I doubt it, since you weren’t even three at the time.
You should have run up to her, unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot, and rendered the young man speechless.
Hello to you.
Pay attention to the music.
Run, run, oh, run!
Come on, sir.
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude, inadequate writing, keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history’s full glory with his uneven telling.
These are unnatural events.
Come on, niece, I’m sure you love him.
I curse him, but he loves me.
This is Casca.
He is indeed worthy of the name “horse,” and you can call all the rest beasts.
Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city.
Master Malvolio?
You have weapons?
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved.
Here comes my little bird.
The rest of the dead are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, and gentlemen of birth and rank.
I will lower my voice.
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh?
I know she trusts you and tells you everything.
Are those my tents on fire?
I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.
Tell me your idea first.
But if your soles are worn out, I can mend you.
I will, as surely as I am a gentleman.
Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves.
They’re calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.
What does he say?
So calm down.
That’s true, lieutenant.
I sent him there, sir, but his crimes deserved a worse punishment.
It was a lovely wedding, and we’re doing really well on our trip home.
It’ll help us more than hurt us.
My lord Sebastian, even though what you say is true, your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time.
You come here with letters against the king, and you take his conceited daughter’s side against his royal highness.
The name suits your fierceness.
I’ll find Romeo to comfort you.
Are you his friend?
Our handwriting gives away our hearts.
What garment would your Honor like to wear today?
In an instant we were separated from them, as if in a dream, and brought here in a daze.    
Our arms, which can be strong and cruel, and our hearts, filled with brotherly love, embrace you with kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
Don’t be afraid.
I swear to her that I haven’t, but it doesn’t change anything.
Help!
Stop her!
If you lie, boy, we’ll have you whipped.
You mean a devil!
Then I salute you with this royal title: long live Richard, England’s worthy king!
Foolish girl, in the eyes of most people this man’s a Caliban, and compared to him, they’re angels.
Get her attention and draw her home with music.
At this time of night?
I never saw a better-designed gown, more elegant and pleasing and well made.
What’s up, man?
I thought it was the right thing to do.
No, don’t even mention him.
Well, I’m glad that everything has been sorted out.
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water, unable to move.
What kind of loyalty is this?
Live, and from now on, say a madman mercifully told you to run away.
Go ahead, do your worst.
Quick, quick.
That’s it!
She already has a face.
Never, Iago.
So I’ll be forced to call you a jerk, Sir Andrew.
Indeed, I should have asked you before who he was.
What, are you busy?
I can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive.
And you can’t deny evidence and argument—They’ve been around since Noah’s ark.
No?
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to.
What men have you lost, Fluellen?
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory.
She’s well.
Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil.
You can’t trust all the rumors.
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings.
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting a man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end.
Malvolio’s coming down the path.
Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France.
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s oppression.
Sing us a song.
The king has broken his heart.
What did Northumberland say about Richmond?
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman, that’s certain, one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare, I happen to know from his maneuvers.
Let them marry your children!
Damn him!
The young generation rises while the old one falls.
In a half an hour he’ll be asleep.
Keep me balanced and sane.
As for your husband, he is noble, wise, and judicious, and he understands what the times require.
Get out of my sight!
Let them go.
I think I saw you there, you wise man.
Look, she’s come home from confession with a happy look on her face.
Knock.
I’ve got some business to take care of.
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants.
Our troops are deployed tomorrow.
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field.
Please lock the door and keep quiet.
So you’ll go to hell?
Meanwhile, we’re the ones who need you.
He’ll release him.
For now, don’t try to persuade me anymore—I ask you as a friend.
He’s his mother’s child from head to toe.
My brother is in heaven.
They are.
Macbeth!
Here’s my servant.
What do you have to say, noble friend?
No.
No epilogue, please.
To work for you, sir.
With all my heart.—Three or four of you go welcome him.—In the meantime, I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud.
What is fated to happen must happen.
The law fully authorizes the penalty, which you have to pay according to the contract.
And don’t lie.
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.
Goodbye then, Hero.
According to the laws of war, you didn’t have to fight a stranger.
Why not?
That’s terrible!
Octavius, I’m older than you are.
One of them contains my picture.
A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance.
If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation.
It is an honor that I do not dream of.
Ha!
My lord, you’re wrong to berate her like that.
Please, try to act a little more serious, or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me, and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia.
Now I know better.
If you’re going to lend us this money, don’t lend it to us as if we were your friends.
If it turns out that she really is running around on me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll break my heart.
I shouldn’t make you do more than you’re able.
Dearest, kindest, most honorable sir, may I say, with your esteemed approval, which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus, that— What do you mean by that?
A very nasty meaning.
I will not take it.
I was bound to him an hour ago, sir, but thankfully he chewed through our ropes.
Say goodbye to your sisters.
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasn’t so free of jealousy.
Why are you so pale?
They killed my children too?
Don’t listen to the bell, Duncan, because it summons you either to heaven or to hell.
Are you good or evil?
He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a Jew’s daughter, and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork.
It’s strongest in the strongest people.
My lord, your promise of the earldom— Richmond!
If we’re like you in everything else, we’ll resemble you in that respect.
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
I won’t leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back.—How are you, my lord?
I swear, old fools become like babies again.
Your peace of mind depends on him.
Murder, murder!
No, boy.
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up.
I hate the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
And she is very smart.
Come here, Leonato.
I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers!
Retreat further, my lord, retreat further.
I’ll put the juice of this flower on Titania’s eyes, and fill her with horrible delusions and desires.
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me.
Get away from me, Satan!
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was, but you wouldn’t answer me, instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone.
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break.
Then they’re cold friends to me.
Stinking like a swamp.
Please don’t take my niece the wrong way, sir.
I hope you’re right.
This is some monster of the island, with four legs, who seems to me to have some kind of ache.
Or if you follow me, you’d better understand that I’ll do something bad to you in the forest.
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture.
If you take more or less than exactly a pound, even if it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce—if the scale changes by even so much as a hair, you die, and all your property will be confiscated.
More of us are here.
She’s very moral.
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven.
I wish you all the best.
They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re just jealous.
Good news, good news!
Here he comes with Captain Jamy, the Scots captain.
O Harry’s wife, do not triumph in my sorrow!
Who’s the spokesman for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?
I will go out.
I don’t understand all dat.
Ma'am, I’d rather— I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband.
I’m sorry to hear this.
Well, we’ll stop, then.
No.
I did them for Edward’s sake—and look how he rewards me.—Oh God, if my prayers don’t satisfy you, and you have to avenge the wrongs I’ve done, at least punish me alone!
Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about.
Let’s go, then!
Stay close by when we wake him up, ma'am.
In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens.
Get rid of your low-class trapping,” she said.
Some of them give me money, some invite me places, some thank me for the kind things I’ve done for them, some try to sell me things.
Go ahead, but I won’t listen.
That’s what the bill says.
Hello.
Now go, and hurry back.
Oh, noise?
A knight on a quest?
That’s authority!
So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John— And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will.
Have a good morning.
It’s true, he died on the day my sister turned thirteen.
Get ready, my lord.
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice?
But how is it possible that you still remember this, through all the darkness of the past?
When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you.
I don’t mean he’s 
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.
You ass!
Fathers, never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent.
Damn it!
I didn’t tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another.
And if they don’t find charity there, they find it someplace else.
His father, if I do say so myself, is an honest but very poor man, and, thank God, likely to live a long time.
Yes, I found him when he was asleep—so that’s taken care of too—and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him.
I guess this is not a fish, but a native who got struck by lightning just now.
Yes, alright, go, I say, and bring him here.
Please, sir, don’t trouble yourself.
Whenever you want, since you’re the one who wants it.
With this ring I give them all to you.
Let’s see how.
Oh, oh, oh!
I was never disloyal, and I never will be.
I know he wouldn’t be a wolf if the Romans didn’t act like sheep.
Young man, your father’s dead.
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that!
and patches of righteousness.
I’ll do that.    
Sir, he ate with this woman at the Porcupine.
If he hadn’t been drunk, he would’ve really roughed you up.
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Two or three men are groaning.
CASSIO  She’s awake, sir.
I did.
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn’t find its heart.
You stupid fool!
Pray well, father.
Go ahead, use your authority.
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours, when they plummet, they plummet that much farther.
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel.
When did I ever do you any harm?
Oh, madam, my old heart is broken, broken.
It’s a monster!
Hang on, sir!
Yet I wish I could take that promise back, so I had it to give again.
Oh, how awful that a lady who’s been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one!
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds, Shylock, so he doesn’t bleed to death.
Oh, is that Kent?
I know you from before.
No, not too upset.
You’ll  Enough of this.
If you aren’t immortal, watch those around you.
Come, gentlemen, let’s discuss tomorrow’s action in my tent.
At my house.
Come down, brother.
If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline.
I’ve got something for you.
Well, to be on the safe side—so I don’t go back on my promise—I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days.
You, fellow, step out of the crowd.
I’ll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf, so that he’ll meet you on the way.
Each day new widows howl, new orphans cry, and new sorrows slap heaven in the face, until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain.
It makes me mad.
And what will happen if I don’t?
Will you help me?—What an ass and a fool, a gullible no-good idiot!
He’s already done so.
We should speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
Are you a man?
Either here or at the Capitol.
I wouldn’t be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s kingdom and the riches of the East too.
Why, you silly man!
She’s an excellent, sweet woman, and there’s no doubt that she is virtuous.
Here, sir!
Cheer up and be at peace.
Who’s this?
What, is today a holiday?
Who said that?
But brother, I have some strange news for you.
Well, then, we’re awake.
Who’s the ruler here?
What’s the name of this forest behind us?
Yes, even if I had a thousand more pounds than that, for I hear that you are  Me, too.
Let’s go.
Who?
No, there it is again.
You worthless girl!
We have to take the king’s side.
I wish she were in love with me instead.
Get out of here, before his bad luck infects you too.
Revise your statement, or you may damage your inheritance.
Yes, my lord.
Yes, monstrous, monstrous!
Hang him immediately.
But if
Now you’re sociable.
I’ll steal away to England, and I’ll steal some more when I get there.
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn’t warmed himself with ale.
I want you to do some things for our wedding, and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both.
The friar’s ready.
So get out of here!
Why are you making them work so hard?
What do you have to say, my dear Nurse?
Oh please, go somewhere else to blab your nonsense.
His knights are getting out of control, and he himself reprimands us about every little detail.
Where’s the jury, the judge, the lawful proceedings, the verdict?
For what?
Can we have some water please here?— Come and wash, Kate, make yourself at home.
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant?
Nor living ones, I hope.
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where.
Yes, my lord.
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn’t give you, as long as it didn’t damage my honor and self-respect?
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried with you.
Can we finish our lunch?
Oh, the world never saw a sweeter creature.
What has Caesar done to deserve your love?
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to.
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king.
Better, since your lordship was nice enough to ask.
Love can make worthless things beautiful.
This is what Calphurnia’s dream means.
The king wants to speak with Cornwall.
What will you give us?
Why are you doing this?
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury?
I dreamt about this.
Read it, great Caesar.
My lord, this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign.
With a needle and thread.
We can all go together.
If I took the kingdom from your sons, I’ll give it to your daughter to make up for it.
That is a certain truth.
You’re right.
Hello, Curan.
We’re three of them.
My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight.
What does Lord Stanley say?
When they’re endangered, I save them.
We’ll listen to him.
That’s not holy, it’s heresy.
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you.
While I stood spellbound, messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!
Signor Lodovico?
How are you feeling, Malvolio?
Oh, you streetwalker!
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy?
Yes, ma'am.
He just said that they’re no good at acting.
When she cries, all the little flowers cry too.
Fair sister, will you go with the princes or stay here with me?
Don’t follow me.
Because I’m a Jew.
What’s the news, my good friends?
He refuses, as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God.
Never.
My comfort is that old age, that poor preserver of beauty, can’t make my face any worse than it already is.
Call the messenger in.
Did you say all?
Can’t you talk?
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin?
So give me your answer, and we’ll shake on it.
But in that “no hope” there are great hopes for you!
Romeo’s a dishcloth compared to him.
Don’t “ Yes, Nurse, what about that?
Why should men be more free than women?
I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger.
I feel this pinprick.
But aren’t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick?
It was some devil.
Who am I, sir?
I’ll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning.
She lied to me, and she may lie to you.
Don’t make me wait for dinner even a moment.
I don’t have anywhere to go, so I don’t need to see.
I’ll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past.
I’ll do everything I can for you, Cassio.
And it’s definitely better to cry because you’re happy than laugh because you’re sad!
No, I know that you’re Signior Lucentio.
You could have come sooner.
Will you abandon such gentle lambs, God, and throw them to the wolves?
My sweet husband, I did not lock you out.
You can trust me.
So pardon him, dear father, for my sake.
My memory is hazy, more like a dream than a recollection.
I must tell you then.
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged.
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct, traditional principles and rules of war.
You can stand in his place.
I’m going to tell Desdemona my feelings.
Oh, give us permission, great king, to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies.
How foolish your fears seem now, Calphurnia!
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ’s dear blood, which He shed for our terrible sins, you must leave and keep your hands off me.
Oh, what a horrible day!
Isn’t that the king?
All right, I’ll stop.
If it pleases your Majesty, it is the token of a man I must fight with, if he’s still alive.
I’m a foolish, senile old man, eighty-something years old, not an hour more or less.
No, ma'am.
I am tired.
I won’t refuse you anything.
And I’ll go to bed at noon.
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin.
Yes, I am.
How dare you serve it to me this way!
If you do that, I’ll never respect you again.
Why do you keep repeating that, woman?
Instead, she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him. 
But please tell me, can you read anything you see?
The biggest clue is his seriousness.
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia.
The will, the will!
And when I get my reward, I’ll get out of here.
What do you want?
Hortensio, good friends like us can get by on a few words.
Shame, eternal shame, and nothing but shame!
After you, sir.
Is Marcus Luccicos in town?
He’s written you a letter.
Tell the constable that.
But, my good lord, the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself.
I’ll go on with my speech praising you, and then I’ll get to the point.
What woman wouldn’t be distressed, being lorded over by a handful of dust?
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about.—Come on, bring in the stocks, now!
I’ll also wear this in my cap.
Wash your hands.
I will not do them wrong.
By this sword, I’ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust.
Where else should his eyes be, if not in his head?
Come, uncle Exeter, enter Harfleur.
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him.
If you’re happy with what you’ve won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny, Then turn to where your lady is, And claim her with a loving kiss.”
Then you might as well say they’re not dead.
Then I have offended no one.
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll show you.
Slay!
Say that it’s my fear that keeps you inside and not your own.
Look, here she comes.
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you?
He’s lying dead in a ditch, with twenty deep gashes in his head, any one of which would have been enough to kill him.
Come on, bring them in.
I’ll recognize him all right, I’m sure of it.
I’m afraid of what they might encourage him to do, considering the state he’s in.
Farewell, sir.
What music should we play then?
I have to follow him and give him the letter.
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I’m old and I’ll die soon.
You talk to him, ma'am.
He cried out, “Wait for me, dear cousin.
Therefore, tell me, what is he doing at sea?
That’s where hell is, and darkness, and fires and stench!
Let’s hear it.
By this sword, I will.
I’m out of patience.
From now on I’ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out, “Enough, enough!” and disappears.
Whose house?
If you stick with me, when the time comes, there will be something in it for you.
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible.
But so what?
I’ve been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power.
Good night, everyone.
What about you?
May the devil turn you black, you white-faced fool!
Who’s that calling?
Who?
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding.
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
When it’s paid, bring your friend back.
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors, where their bones are kept safe.
Certainly not!
Don’t laugh at me, but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia.
I hope I see him and hear him again soon.
I’ll call it “Bottom’s Dream” because it’s so deep that it has no bottom.
All this excitement has made the time fly by.
Hello, sweet lady.
Who’s next?  
We’ll drive them to a 
I wish I were Sleep and Peace, so I could spend the night with you.
But mock me gently, dear Kate, because I love you terribly.
No, my lord, that was me.
I don’t like what you’re asking me to do.
Where’s that dog?
Stay calm.
You’d give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit.
It has no fighting spirit.
Give me the daggers.
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason?
What are you going to do?
I changed my mind.
I know your position.
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.
I beg you not to do this, my lord.
I’m your master, Dromio.
A good plan, warrior king.
And I’ve built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard’s soul.
Tell me, do I have your consent to kill them?
We have  And one of them is the criminal Deformed.
Did you see the king today, Lord Derby?
We respected the beat of the song, sir.
Is the king awake, worthy thane?
By St. Paul, ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmond’s soldiers could, dressed up in their most sword-proof armor.
Are your men searching for him?
Mine too.—Are you listening, monster?
What do you think, Norfolk?
Now, my friendly servant, thank you.
I will walk around and mingle with all of you, playing the humble host.
Amen to that.
I should always be wise.
Nice Grumio, bring me some.
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness’s mercy.
You’re    Pull out your tool now.
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting.
Forever and forever, farewell, Brutus!
Something there isn’t a word for.
Whatever you want—I made it for you.
Yes, if that would be all right with your Lordship.
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever?
I hear someone coming.
Tell me again, where did you leave those lowlifes?
Set fire!
His eyes were as green as leeks.
Yes, I do, lady.
I think he’s got the money.
Cousin, you didn’t used to be so thickheaded.
Because that’s what you are now.
Or ask you to leave the room?
Go ahead, you fool.
What is your news?
A lioness gave birth in the streets, and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead.
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around?          
Please, hurry.                    
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning.
If we have sweet-smelling breath, I’m sure they’ll say “it’s a sweet play.” Now no more talking.
Let me come clean.
Good-bye!
Besides, they’re fresh.
All these aging faculties tell me—and I cannot be wrong—that you are my son, Antipholus.
So hurry up, because we have twenty miles to cover today.
Even good men have bad luck.
I leave him to you.
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb.
What’s his name?
Go, take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
Oh, do you think we’ll ever meet again?
Aren’t you a rational human being?
Sir, I’m half-blind.
Why, he won’t wake up till Judgment Day.
Dearest Olivia— What do you have to say for yourself, Cesario?—My lord, please— My lord wants to speak.
I’m not Cinna the conspirator.
Hello, beautiful Helena!
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim.
Everything’s OK.
You’re a spirit, I know.
Nothing, good sir, except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head.
Come here, herald.—Let the trumpet sound!—Read this out.
Didn’t I deserve anything more than a fool’s head?
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us.
Shame on you!
Oh, sweet England!
On top of her?
The wine of life has been poured out, and only the dregs remain.
He’s quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens.
He rushed away on serious business.
Who’s that at the gate, uncle?
Liberty!
Everything we’ve heard is bad.
You thought about it too long, considering what you found there.
Any news from Genoa?
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided.
I say my prayers out loud.
But I know you’d never force me to tell you things I don’t want to, so I should be polite and tell you what I can.
What do you think of his neighbor, the Scottish lord?
Are you crazy?
Tell them you know that Hero loves me.
Oh, my old master!—Who tied him up?
Signor Bassanio!
Suffer love!
What income, what profit does it bring in?
What would you like me to do at Salisbury?
Yes, mother, but I wish I hadn’t.
Who doesn’t know that the good duke is dead?
That’s burglary, that is.
Donalbain.
I’m begging you, good Mercutio, let’s call it a day.
It’s Casca—I know your voice.
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world, and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts.
Madam, you’ve given me life and given me a living too.
What are you doing?
All right, go ahead, keep up your little game, pretend to be sympathetic, but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back.
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking?
I don’t know why I should be afraid, since I haven’t done anything wrong.
It’s true.
Gower is a good captain, and is well versed and well read in the wars.
And then return to you and nothing else?
Out, out, brief candle.
You left him out in the storm in the black night, bareheaded, a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea, the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars.
There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs—good and evil.
He’s a good man.—Let’s go, Desdemona.
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications.
Welcome, good Cambio.
The father and the master and the king didn’t order their subordinates' deaths when they ordered their services.
Let’s get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall.
The moon has set.
Come on, you’re drunk.
You’re trying to trick me, my lord.
Great kings of France and England, I owe you both equal service and loyalty.
Well, okay.—I swear to God, both their stories match.
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan, but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband’s still alive.
Who asked you to call her?
Mr. Fabian, stay with this gentleman until I come back.
They all fell asleep together, as if they’d planned it.
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears.
Villains, you didn’t do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar’s sides.
Let your anger fall on me then, even if its sharpness pierces my heart.
I like it too.
No, with Demetrius.
I’ll take comfort in my books and music, reading and practicing my instruments.
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die, for she says she’ll die if he doesn’t love her, and that she’ll die before she tells him, and she’ll die if he woos her and she’s made to hold back even one of her usual insults.
You corrupt judge, why did you let her escape?
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye!
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break.
Those are the things we pine for now.
My freedom.
Don’t you think you should go to bed, Malvolio?
I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely.
He’s a raven with the feathers of the dove.
Go as fast as you can.
It stands by her bedside.
That’s just how he is.
Nobody’s that bad.
You’ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government.—Okay, take him away.
Do you see something wrong with that?
I tell you, you would find the rituals of war and, I promise you, its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise.
In these less dainty times, you’re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him.
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled.
If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed?
What’s the matter?
Hermia’s not holding onto me anymore.
Why are you acting so angry?
You’ll beat me?
The devil’s advice is nicer.
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God, the law, my honor, and her feelings?
Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again.
No, sir, she’s human.
It’s not okay!
The day, my friends, and everything await me.
Very good!
Or are we both on drugs?
If I may say so, your Majesty, as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to.
Oh, will you leave me alone in the dark?
Have you seen Master Lorenzo!
Monster sweetie, be a good monster and just speak once.
Well, the  Shall we get moving?
Because she’s been chosen by Signior Hortensio.
Is my father well?
I will be angry.
Tybalt was my dearest cousin.
Don’t bother us up here.
He leaves me to my own contentment, but that’s the one thing I cannot find.
What does it matter?
Someday you can get revenge.—Oh, you bastard!
Please, come to his house with me.
What do you mean by that, Malvolio?
His letter will tell you how he’s doing.  
Why couldn’t you be attended by my servants, or by Regan’s?
Don’t put me in the stocks.
He’s a traitor.
Poison never came from such a sweet place.
I’m not a traitor.
Don’t say that—unless you want to be one of my friends.
I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him.
I am not in the giving mood today.
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news.
I shall, King Harry.
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud.
Be merciful and say “death.” Exile is much worse than death.
Really, niece, you’ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people.
With all my heart.
If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon.
That’s an oath of great power, and our fury must subside.
If you really love me, you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him.
I wish you’d won the  Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale.
Oh, you’re wrong.
I asked a servant.
Help me, help me!
Have you ever heard of anything like that, Roderigo?
He’s welcome here.
Amen to that!
And mine say two hundred.
If we’re all pork-eaters, we won’t be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon, even if we’ve got the money for it.
What do you have to say for yourself, Hermia?
If they do fight, I hope Lysander is safe!
Don’t dishonor your mothers!
I’ll show you how.
As a friend.
Go immediately, and do exactly as I wrote down.
But you’re all wound up about fashion, too.
Goodbye.
Oh God!
I am.
She says you’re going to marry her.
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way?
Cassius, go to the next street and divide the crowd.
You men are rank beginners!
By this token, you’ll be admitted to their cell.
Because of me?
No, sir, I live by the church.
Othello’s wife has a lot of influence now.
Don’t get up yet.
Yes, my good lord.
Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook?
Which is the lady I’m supposed to marry?
Shame on Romeo!
Let’s hear what Antony has to say.
Yes, but the mustard is probably too hot.
And then I’ll be the leader of pain, and maybe I’ll lead you as far as death.
That’s strange.
Baptista is a noble gentleman—one to whom my father is not completely unknown—and lovely as his daughter is, she is entitled to any number of suitors—myself among them.
I don’t like it.
Lurk out of sight.
Just think, I could be Count Malvolio!      
I never saw her till now.
That woman who claims I am her husband—I loathe her in my soul.
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized.
After a little while, I’ll beat him too.
Stay here.
Why are you bothering this poor man!
Has Banquo left the court?
Yes, but I am insulting myself by thinking this way.
Why didn’t I just adopt a beggar’s child left at my doorstep, whose shame and dishonor I could have denied, not being its true father?
Ever since I arrived here, just now, I’ve been hearing strange rumors.
I’ll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
You did.
Please, tell my father, madam, I won’t marry yet.
Even if he were as important a man as the devil—as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself—he’s required, see, your Grace, to keep his vow.
Do I ask you to follow me?
I won’t deny him anything of mine, including my own body and my husband’s bed.
Oh dear gods!
Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless.
Please do.
It’s true, Hero says so.
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night, she looks out Hero’s bedroom window.
I’d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse.
Bring me face to face with Macbeth, that devil of Scotland.
That governs the torso and heart, doesn’t it?
If he’s caught the Benedick, he’ll lose all his money before he’s cured.
Her name is Portia.
Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth.
Cicero too?
Don’t be crass.—You all look confused.
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this?
We have to strike while the iron’s hot.
But what’s the joke?
No, my lord.
Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment?
Come on, be a man.
This is a pitiful sight!
Say something again.
Benvolio is part of the Montague family.
Just obey me a little bit longer.
Good fool, good jester, I’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle, and a pen, ink and paper.
This song’s about my dead father.
Now he’ll sit under a  Let’s go.
Go, lad, and take them to the pantry.
Say something!
Is Antonio here?
This is the end of my journey, the end of my life.
Has the storm passed?
Hello, mortal!
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting.
If it were me, I’d be very upset too.
Well, I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up.
Indeed, his mocking spirit has now crawled into a  Truly, it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick.
Now, now, both of you gentlemen!
Tomorrow, while it’s still early, I will go see the witches.
That may be true, my lord.
The tyrant I’m serving now can go to hell!
He should imprison the person who named you, instead.
That’s good, Lion!
I tell you, I’m as sane as any man in Illyria.
If I repeated it to you, it would kill you as soon as you heard it.
You know I gave it to you just now.
Shylock is my name.
Say I will love her everlastingly.
Thomas, the earl of Surrey, and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers.
Thank you for that joke.
Why, you scoundrel!
You attract me to you, you cruel magnet!
Oh, I’m sure you don’t dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone, even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel.
Bloodshed will force you to.
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you.
We’ve all been duped.
And yet, against all odds, I win her over!
Tybalt, old Capulet’s nephew, has sent a letter to Romeo’s father’s house.
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown, but I didn’t ask him to cut it all to pieces.
That’s why they say love is a child.
The moon looks sad to me.
Let me see his face.
Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol.
Now they work for me.
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order.
This chatter is no cure for my toothache.
I never caused her any harm, as far as I know.
Well, you’re a liar, then.
You’re right, sir.
That’s exactly what they said.
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for!
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender.
Though we have lost a generous king, we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king.
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.
Why?
My lord?
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them.
But here are other matters to be dealt with.
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe.
What, not a word?
I want to use this money to set my father free.
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath?
And I’ll help you.
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate?
I’ll look for him and secretly help him.
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague’s back, but instead it’s mis-sheathed in my daughter’s breast.
If you don’t need it for some important reason, then give it back to me.
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl.
God in heaven bless her!
It’s another Hero!
We don’t want you to think we came here to offend you, except that we want to offend you with our good intentions.
You’re shaking with emotion.
Look, my love, what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
Have more than you show, Speak less than you know, Lend less than you owe.
Look after my goods and possessions.
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated.
I hear his footsteps.
He is made of treachery, and has run away to avoid his crimes.
Here’s more insanity for us.
I’ve promised them I would, and they’re expecting it.
I refuse to accept that.
I’m telling you, your husband.
Very sad.
No, you can’t sign a contract like that for me!
What man is that?
I’m locked in one of them.
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression, nor has the long, sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color.
Look, my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me.
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he’s preparing for war.
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.
Leave me, my friend.
Yes, my lord.
I’m sure I’ll never get married in the way my sisters say they’re married, loving their father only.
No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
You’re busted.
Calm down.
Here.
This is Caesar you’re looking at.
Read it.
I’m off, my lord.
You flea, you louse, you winter cricket!
Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell, Signor Baptista?
Speak, Claudio, that’s your cue.
Well, Petruchio, all this is very encouraging.
Goodbye, you dumb old spirit.
What, are we playing with interjections?
So stay for a while.
I’ll find him right away, sir, and carry out the business as well as I can.
I know his soul’s in heaven, fool.
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one, as he thinks, who is the bravest, most valorous, and thrice-worthy gentleman of England.
Oh, go away!
Madam, what should I do?
Why shouldn’t she take my hand, father?
But I’ll tell you something from my soul.
Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me!
So go away.
If we crown him, I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage.
In God’s name, who are you?
We’re close enough now.
Beware of the devil.
I pray to God he isn’t.
A second Daniel!—A Daniel, Jew!
How will I recognize you in the future?
We’ll never see each other again.
I’ve got no hope that he survived.
Who’s there, aside from this foul weather?
Me too.
If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t recognize him.
You’ve won the wager, and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you.
It’s bad news when a country is ruled by a child.
With the quick, intelligent wit she’s rumored to have, she can’t really be such a bad judge of character that she’d refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick.
Don’t listen to him, Emilia, even though he’s your husband.
But he’s not better than mine.
No, you monstrous hags, I’ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such things—I don’t know what I’ll do exactly, but it’ll be devastating.
This harms my reputation.
Come on.
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married.
And brief, good mother—I’m in a hurry.
Come on, Antonio.
And I departed in a rage, right?
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints.
I still have the smell of blood on my hand.
The poor souls—how strangely they talk!
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind.
It’s as strange as this other thing which I don’t understand.
Then die and be damned!
It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more.
Well, anyway, goodbye.
We’ll leave, Brutus.
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough.
Why did I just send you home?
Listen to him talk about war, and you’ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles.
When I said that, I was angry too.
I could have saved her.
It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.
So this letter, which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant, isn’t going to scare him at all.
He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness.
Come like shadows and depart in the same way!
Sir Topas!
He’s too good to have any compassion for you.
I did.
That’s right, and then after we fixed the moon, we’d go bird-hunting.
I’ve told you what I intend to do, and I’ve sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract.
Good sir, this ring was given to me by my wife.
And that’s true too.
He could never bear carnation.
Good heavens!
You truly did.
Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened.
You have to come with me.
I know they do, and I certainly deserve it.
You are welcome, sir.
Then she ran away to grieve alone.
One, so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling, and two, so that when their hair falls out it doesn’t land in their dinner.
It’s Brabantio.
Go to him, Sir Topas.
To our horses, you gallant princes.
Then I hope night shadows your day, and death takes your life!
Then run away.
Even if she lives till the end of the world, she’d keep burning an additional week.
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night.
The villain won’t escape.
Madam, I am not well.
Wind and rain can’t wash it off.
He’s starving me to death.
The bitter one is the other one—that’s you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool, boy?
An angel is walking on earth.
Well, thank God I’m cured!
My lord, my life is as important to me as yours is to you, and it was never as precious to me as it is now.
Leonato’s daughter had told us everything.
His body will lie in my tent tonight, with the honorable observance that suits a soldier.
Then he’s no good.
It probably has something to do with… I don’t know.
That counts for everything.
He’s a king, a king!
I didn’t order it.
Let’s follow them to see how this turns out.
Come on, my dear Greek philosopher.
That’s the one: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.
Why do you think I’m making fun of you when I tell you I love you?
But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble.
Farewell.
Good Mr. Peaseblossom, I’d like to get to know you better too.—And you, may I ask what your name is, sir?
I don’t know you.
Don’t swear by the future, because you’ve ruined it before it has even arrived.
Are you afraid to act the way you desire?
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her.
I can’t remember anything I’ve ever done to offend anyone.
But you were with him, weren’t you?
He’s going senile.
He is a noble prisoner!
You say you don’t know what the girl thinks.
I beg your pardon.
How do you do, sir.
My sword will talk for me.
I’ll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind.
No, sir, worse off.
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality.
Well, then, I hope he chokes on it!
Be loud and obnoxious.
I won’t fail.
I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of, unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me.
Yes, sir.
Get out, you horrible poison.
Sir Toby Belch!
Let me borrow a mirror.
Regan, is that what you said?
You’re not asleep yet, sir?
Oh, I’d never be that cruel.
Puppet”?
I’m no less noble than you are, Edmund.
No, I don’t, sir.
Tell me.
And I won’t be there either.—Edmund, I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father.
Me, “greedy”!
I hope that’s all he loses.
Ah sir, ah sir.
That’s true, my good boy.—Come on, take us to that hut.
You’re competing for
Sweet marjoram.
Thank you, sir.
In fact, every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself.
There!
How handsome it is.
Show me the way.
God Almighty, there must be some essential goodness even in evil, if men would only look for it.
Good Lord, what a clown you are!
Was a man ever beaten as much as me?
Goodbye.
Give me that pickax and the crowbar.
Yes, with Cassio.
Also, he’s left you all his walkways—in his private gardens and newly planted orchards—on this side of the Tiber River.
You need to leave to take care of your own business.
It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar, who comes in triumph over Pompey’s defeated sons?
I followed it here, or I should say it dragged me here.
Where are they supposed to come?
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
Right this instant, I’m going to Caesar’s funeral.
All this”?
You are what’s left of the noblest man that ever lived.
Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.
Most noble Antony!
You are completely wrong about this king.
Nor is it up to you, my lord.
I swear, this fool has an excellent singing voice.
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar.
I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen.
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine.
They sing when they die.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Only God knows when we’ll meet again.
This’ll be a wonderful kingdom to live in, where they play music for free.
If it’s me, there’s no time as good as this hour of Caesar’s death, and no weapon better than your swords, covered with the noblest blood in the world.
My husband is often like this, and he has been since he was a child.
Take that, and that!
I’ll call you a minstrel.
But I say amen to everything she said.
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
I’ll be back soon to wake up your generosity.
What else could you possibly think of me?
Why are you frowning like that?
All right.
Welcome, gentlemen.
My legs may be yellow, but I don’t feel blue.
I love him dearly, and I shall continue to favor him.
Tubal, a wealthy Jew I know, will supply me with the cash.
He’s standing ready outside the door.
To kill the boys with the luggage!
If this isn’t what you’ve been hoping for, I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever.
Coward!
Your descendants will be kings, even though you will not be one.
I know you for what you really are, but as your sister I’m reluctant to criticize you.
Over your wounds—which, like speechless mouths, open their red lips, as though to beg me to speak—I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men.
What’s the reason for this horrible shouting?
These lovers are saying some strange things, Theseus.
Yes, him, woman.
Tomorrow, and then every day after that.
You all know this cloak.
Do you like her, Claudio?
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia?
Holy Franciscan Friar!
I won’t live long enough, and all my efforts will fail me.
If you dare to fight today, come to the field.
You, good friend, save me a piece of marzipan, and if you love me, have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
We have to give up and let him go.      
Goodbye.
Which one is it?
Run to the Capulets.
No.
I’ll go to him.
Neither will I.
If his cause is wrong, our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it.
Oh, let me kiss his hand!
There’s a spirit in here!
We’re ruined, lady, we’re ruined!
How can you square things with me?
And, being men, the contents of Caesar’s will would enrage you.
Look, here’s where Cassius’s dagger pierced it.
Goodbye, my lord.
That’s him.
Yes.
Have some patience, please.
Give me some comfort, Nurse.
How green!
I know the glove is a glove.
Let’s go to the king.
I think you’re more articulate.
He knows no more about the proper practice of war, see—the ancient practices—than a puppy.
What makes you say that?
Oh,  Master, master, look!
Indeed, before you arrived here, old Siward, with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle, was making his way here.
But enough about that.
The English are in the field, French lords.
By the future.
Stay and tell me more.
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you.
Which ones are the malefactors?
What should I say?
children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country.
If I’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this, whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish.
Come back to my house with me.
Trebonius!
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace.
Now go find the forest ranger.
Why did this have to happen now?
So go on, tell me the news.
But, really, what’s going on, Clarence?
Ride to Salisbury.
Didn’t you know?
Therefore my sadness is without limit.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
I swear, I don’t like the look of you.
We don’t doubt it.
I couldn’t stay behind after you left.
Oh, no.
Why, my boy?
Please, uncle, let’s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you.
Please, hurry up.
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking.
No, follow him now, before he divulges the prank and ruins everything.
And that’s why he went crazy.
Soon we will toast around the table.
Be tough,” says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest woman, since my father cheated on my mother.
Who are you talking about?
Why has your queen, Juno, called me here to this grassy spot?
Are these wind instruments?
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave.
We’re sorry to hear this.
Run, everyone, run!
Listen to me, because I’m older than you, surely.
Are you going?
Oh, dear gods!
So I die with a kiss.
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money.
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it.
We’re at your service, my lord.
I guess not—for good reason, as you’ll soon hear.
Oh, where’s Romeo?
I’ll do so.
So, to answer your question.
It’s Captain Macmorris, right?
Iago, who started it?
You’d better go inside.
Edward’s sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne, my wife, has bid good night to the world.
I wasn’t talking to any man at that time, my lord.
Now this is where you come in.
Yes, I have great cause to be thankful.
Calm down, gentle cousin.
Yes, sir, it’s all too true, God help us.
Thank you, dear Nurse.
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Poor man!
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
No doubt, my lord.
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo?
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up.
Such a wonderful father-in-law and wife make this place a paradise.
He’s serious.
Worthy sir, greetings!
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel, and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
Tell me.
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me!
Huntsman, look after my hounds.
But often in these cases, reports are just estimates.
He hasn’t arrived yet.
Then follow me and listen to my speech, friends.
But I’ll linger.
This is the prophecy that the wizard 
With that, I hope God is with him!
If I died right now I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life.
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too, Caius Cassius—because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms.
You who are wicked beyond belief, the only “explanation” I’ll accept from you is for you to hang yourself.
When he stands where I am and sees you there.  
Be a careful mother, madam, and think about your son, the young prince.
What do you believe?
I will.
Since you love money and power so much, I won’t be your wife.
When I send for you, come out wearing masks.
I think it is, sir.
The will!
That’s good, if he’ll really do it.
You have to contradict me, do you?
Anyway, how are you, Jessica?
Oh sweet mistress, speak!
I don’t think you’re treating me fairly.
You have the sacred power to cure both of us.
These lords seem so astonished that they’ve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes.—But whatever the reason for your losing your senses, you can know for sure that I’m Prospero, that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed, and became the lord of it.
Oh, it’s too terrible.
Cassio’s a good friend of mine—My lord, I can see you’re upset.
Yes, really.
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused.
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen.
I would, if I had a mirror.
You’ll grant me, you hedgehog?
Is this the cure for my aching bones?
Your eyes are like stars, and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime.
Bring your master home.
Good night, Lord Brutus.
I’ll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood.
But brother Anthony— Don’t, it’s no big deal.
May God thank you for it.
Come, let’s go to the dance.
Master, should I watch the door?
What was that cry for?
I’m not going to bed tonight.
Tell me.
Get out, you dark-skinned gypsy!
We’re done for!
We’ll have a couch made up that’s softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful 
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts.
Do your best.
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace.
His son was a minor only two years ago.
But life itself, my wife, and the whole world aren’t more valuable to me than your life is.
Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be.
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already.
Your Grace heard their saccharine words, but didn’t take note of their poisonous intentions.
What?
No trouble, sir.
Soak your hands in blood and gore, since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors.
But my daughter should know about this, so she can be prepared with an answer just in case.
There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood.
He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot, and was wounded, as you see there, when trying to apprehend him.
I think she’ll be a better soldier.
Let me talk to you about your situation.
Hortensio 
Why, isn’t all this joking better than groaning about love?
We’ll meet again at nine in the morning.
Who’s this Adam you speak of?
I wish my father could see them with my eyes.
My brains are injured.
Will we hear from you before bedtime, Catesby?
Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me.
I will.
Hello!
If that’s what you want, all right.
Will you come with me?
It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none.
If you can love a man of this temperament, Kate, whose face a sunburn wouldn’t make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself, let your eye improve me.
Am I myself?
You gave us the slip, sir, the slip.
You must be crazy to say that!
I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around here.
From then on we’ll turn our backs on Athens.
My good King, surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over.
Oh, uncle, it’s better to smile and flatter indoors where it’s dry than get soaked out here.
When did I say all that?
But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar.
Romeo will answer the challenge.
That’s it—I’m done.
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks, torches in their hands.
A ship you sent me to find, to book passage out of here.
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread!
What do you mean, get rid of him?
And, as the speaker of any prologue should, I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly.
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story.—Please go stand farther away.
Here, madam:     Translate.
Now she’s gone forever.—Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a while.
The lack of time and the risk I’m under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other’s news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long.
Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband.
What, is trusting a friend such a crime?
So order the armies to rest, and let’s go home to share the glories of this happy day.
I hope they don’t attack us now.
Othello’s career is over.
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria?
Have you heard about Albany’s and Cornwall’s troops?
Let’s sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed.
That part of his reputation will stand.
Tell me, Friar, in what part of my body is my name embedded?
My lord, my lord— I don’t want to hear any more about it.
It’s not a false gallop, anyway.
I’d rather go without the money.
Listen, listen to what I say: whoever strikes first, I’ll run him through with my sword, as sure as I’m a soldier.
Come, come away.
I would, my boy.
Portia, what are you doing awake?
You have my word as a gentleman that I’ll always be grateful to you.
Run to the Capitol and nothing else?
We’ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back.
So tell me what’s been going on.
Your servants were fighting your enemy’s servants before I got here.
Portia, are you really gone?
I’ll vouch for Grumio.
It’s midnight.
To Adriana?
Are you always so funny?
Oh, your report is too poetic, but it sounds so true!
They’re murdering Caesar!” Who’s there?
Go to her and tell her for me.
No, you’ll see, four days will quickly turn into four nights.
Thanks, my good countryman.
Wait just a minute, you brazen hussy.
Speak, nephew.
I swear, I could do so much— Please, no more.
Past noon.
It’s almost morning.
Let them judge us however they please.
Yes!
Tell me which part I’m going to play, then go on.
Goodbye, then.
But his frail heart, too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness, gave out.
No, I am a Welshman.
Has my master returned yet?
But my hair looks good anyway, doesn’t it?
So you got what you deserved, and were locked up in this cave, which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be.
I’m afraid the people have made Caesar their king.
The old guy.
As you can see, these lovers are looking for a place to fight.
All right Ursula, as Beatrice arrives, we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick.
Stop, for God’s sake!
Madam, there’s a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you.
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe.
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword—it can’t hurt anyone, thank God.—My lord, I thank you for your many kindnesses.
You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised.
I’m not afraid of anyone but him.
I’ll do my best to make this lady love you.
A grave?
What’s the matter, husband?
Only really cruel people can be called deformed.
I say a devil.
We came into the world as brother and brother, so now let’s enter hand in hand—not one before the other.
This just may cheer me up.
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock (as mine does) and bring you home on its own, without the need for a messenger.
Anyway, what should we do?
What victory does he bring home?
Are you making fun of me?
I hope he’s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him.
Must I bite?
You thought because he didn’t speak English like a native he couldn’t handle an English club.
Obey your parents, keep your word, don’t swear, don’t sleep with another man’s wife, and don’t covet flashy clothes.
She has been in a man’s bed.
You know how young my daughter is.
Yes, just like this.
Antipholus has gone insane, no question about it.
I have done the deed.
Nurse?
Make a bug show of mourning for her, hang sad epitaphs up at your family’s tomb, and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies.
How are you doing, brother?
Give me your hand.
Do you honestly think—tell me, Emilia—there are women who’d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner?
He’s made me a little sore, I’ll admit.
But how long will her beautiful life last?
Pretending?
You speak so highly of fools!
Don’t wrong her birth.
He knows I recognize him.
Yes, and I’ll do everything I just said.
Don’t say that, Lysander.
I’ll try talking to him again.
Good cousin, good Meg, good Ursula, come help me get dressed.
Tell me, so I can cut it out of myself. 
Yes, my good lord.
Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this.
You are my other self, my oracle, my prophet, my dear brother!
The devil must be behind this.
Who says he is?
I promise.
No, before!
But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures.
What trade, boy?
He called me Sebastian.
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last.
Lysander, say something!
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers.
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you, ex-daughter of mine.
Take my hand, Hastings.
Please, my lord, don’t be friendly with her.
They wouldn’t say anything?
He can’t bear his grief and so he’s losing his mind.
Good to see you, Master Antipholus.
Oh yes, you spoke, my lord, but total nonsense.
What are you fighting about?
One more time, we proclaim this publicly: If anyone will pay this man’s bail, he will not be put to death.
You lie.
No, but the barber’s assistant has been seen with him.
You go ahead, and I will follow you.
Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud.
No, it’d be a sin to think such a low thought.
Angry enough to run away.
This will make them both so afraid that they’ll kill each other just by looking at each other.
You didn’t give me any gold.
His horse is better than the Neapolitan’s and he frowns more than the Count Palatine.
Though he seems a little old-fashioned, there is much care and courage in this Welshman.
How will we pass the time without some entertainment?    
Am I a married man or a bachelor?
Or should I say it’s her uncle?
Are you Tyrrel?
You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient!
I could find it in my heart to beat him— Come on, kiss my feet.
Have all your conquests, glories, triumphs, achievements, come to so little?
But one word more— He will not be commanded by you.
Yes, yes!
Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken.
Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too?
I tried to stop speaking plainly, since you dislike plain speech so much.
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair?
Damn it!
Why, anyone can see what this means.
is yours.” And, though I say so in his presence, if he’s not a friend of the best kings, you’ll find him king of the best friends.
The morning is approaching.
Only too well.
When he couldn’t what?
Take care.
Can’t you see for yourself?
Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or have her killed.
And me too.
Oh, Cassio, where did you get this?
You’re a lover.
Make Cassio angry somehow, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else you want.
That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world.
Absolutely, you idiot.
What have you got on your head?
Get busy, go!
I’m a carpenter, sir.
I hope I enjoy wearing it, for my heart is very heavy.
But don’t think I’m doing this because I’m greedy.
If he isn’t what he might be, then I wish to God he were!
No, that I don’t remember.
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
Leave me alone.
I pray that God ends his life before I die, so I can say, “The dog is dead!”
As my child, I order you to do so.
I’ve got nothing to do with you.
Don’t trouble him further until his mind is more settled.
I would’ve been a sore king then.
Have you completely forgotten?
I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden.
But, look, poor me, what a terrible tragedy is here!
I wish I were in an alehouse in London!
Both, both, my girl.
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her.
As long as hell and Richard want it.
We will.
Don’t compare a woman’s love for a man with my love for Olivia.
Yes, sir.
All this conversing has turned men into tongues—and fancy ones, at that.
Do you know his plans?
That’s enough for the senate.
I won’t say a word.
But where’s my fool?
I’m as commanding as she is proud, and when two raging fires meet, they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them.
And even though I’m in a distasteful mood, I’ll work on being happy.
That’s why I wish my sister didn’t have a name, sir.
What should I pay you?
If you work for him, you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap.—So how’s it going, uncle?
You don’t need it yet.
Who’s that coming?
I will.
Remind Richard of this, and he will weep.
Sometimes I think I’m no smarter than average.
Some good friend of his must have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much.
Be pointed and brief.
The sun is up and we’re wasting the day!
Give me your hand.
Come on, envelope, open up for me.
So you’re the only one who could play Pyramus.
Thanks for telling me.
He’s a knight.
Drunk?
Sir, a word before you go.
Happy indeed, the way we have spent the day.
Why do you sound so odd?
The king—whom I hope God will protect better than you would like—can’t get a minute’s rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints.
Why, what a complicated case this is!
Mankind is so beautiful!
I hear my father coming.
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather, from whom your own title to the crown derives.
And so he fainted.
Did you call, my lord?
If only you were, sir.
This island contains everything beneficial to life.
Only to watch that title become worthless, as her mother has.
Armed forces have already landed.
Promise me you’ll let me live, and I’ll confess the truth.
You’ve done a good job, that other men can attribute their murders to you!
How are you, my lord?
At least tell me where you’re going.
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules.
Put out your torches.
Be thrifty.
Come out, I order you.
Beat them down!
Life, wealth, everything belongs to Death.
You’d be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking.
Since you’re giving me new assignments, let me remind you what you promised me but haven’t come through with yet.
No, that’s not it, trust me.
It would be inappropriate—dangerous, even—for me to be seen working against the Moor, as I would if I stayed.
Well, let’s hope you stay in that noble frame of mind.
I’m tired and feeling heavy, but I can’t sleep.
Will you come immediately?
A friend.
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite?
I can’t believe you’re my son.
Look how your servants wait on you, each one ready to do whatever you command.
What do you think you’re doing?
Calm down, Kate.
Kent’s been banished just like that?
Seyton!—I’m sick at heart when I see—Seyton, come here!—This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne.
Yes, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
Isn’t my name Hero?
Let those who would mar this fair land’s peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth.
I know that voice.
Evil villain!
Now that I think about the danger of these knights, if you come to stay with me, please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you.
So, in God’s name, let’s march.
Farewell, hostess.
They vanished strangely.
What part of her body is Ireland?
Why, what are you afraid of?
Enliven them with yours!
And now he’s gone.
Or, if you don’t delay, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.
She’s cold.
Now get on with your story.
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness.
You should’ve saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself.
Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child!
But it’s true—I don’t want to get all mushy and go on and on, but the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, if I only had a title good enough to match his!— Come on, get to the point.
Your eyes look threatening.
Shut up.
Do you think so?
That’s all I want, and I’ll do anything to accomplish it.
St. George loses his holiness once  Then, by myself— You’ve misused yourself.
Morning’s here.
Amen.
How could he be in debt without me knowing it?
Your delicacies aren’t worth as much to me as your welcome is.
I  Isn’t this good?
If you’re the ones setting my daughters against me, don’t let me be foolish enough to take it lying down.
Don’t worry, I couldn’t care less.
Claudio!
Which ring did you give away, my lord?
How did he get such an idea?
I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, like my father before me; my father, Vincentio, a successful, world-traveled merchant, was one of the 
With this in mind, speak, my lord.
Be quick.
Who should hang them?
Why?
You can’t trust anyone who abuses her own father, her flesh and blood.
You’ll have to woo Bianca like the rest.
But you’re still my child, my flesh and blood—or rather you’re a disease in my flesh, a disease I still have to call my own.
But, tell me, is young George Stanley alive?
Where is he?
I urge you to deliver your verdict.
Hello, brother Edmund.
Here, sir!” You stupid, unpolished dolts!
The Venetians are waiting for their food.
And I think that if I hadn’t been brave and strong, she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave.
I don’t think about them now.
She disgusts me, the little hussy!
You’ll have your answer soon.
Thank you, master.
And maybe a third?
Prepare yourselves.
You haven’t lost it unless you think you have.
Give me an almanac.
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you.
In that case, I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest, and bestow your daughter on me.
Yes, Petruchio.
Swearing is for priests, cowards, overly cautious men, feeble old people, and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse.
Have you had lunch yet?
Good to see you, Iago.
Actually, I’d like a few pounds of grass.
He ran out that way, sir, when he couldn’t— Follow him, now!
Miserable England, I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced.—Come, lead me to the block.
Ha!
That’s what I said when I first conjured the tempest.
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words.
I’m almost ready to break down hearing this much.
My brother thinks highly of you, and because of his affection, has helped arrange your marriage—but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy.
What, you don’t say a word?
I wasn’t expecting you, and I’m not ready to receive you.
What a heavy sigh!
Should we all give up and drown?
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened.
What have you heard from her?
I am the only daughter in my father’s family, and all the brothers too—but I’m not completely sure about that.
What gentleman?
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret, the Lady Hero’s waiting woman, tonight.
Do you know him?
My own flesh and blood rebels against me!
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant, you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed.
Three thousand ducats.
Still, did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her?
Weren’t you ordered, on penalty of— Why Dover?—Let him answer that question first.
He’s an honest man who detests evil actions.
Not if you go away, there isn’t.
Yes, my good lord.
Follow them, please.
So be it.
You can do whatever you want as long as it’s socially appropriate.
My dear friends, thanks for your patience.
Norfolk, we’re going to have a few blows, right?
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland?
The captain who brought me to shore has my women’s clothes.
I’ve made my choice.
And Cassio’s killed?
Indeed, you have wronged me, you liar.
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold.
How are you feeling now?
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died.
I do too, my lord.
My old bones are tired.
A tailor made you.
In that case, I don’t much care for you either.
But our courage should only be the greater for that.
Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed.
So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside.
You speak well.
You annoying idiot, what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me?
Here, take away the dish.
Does she?
The king has been informed of all their plans, but they have no idea.
Where should I go?
She’s shut inside a dead man’s tomb!
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off.
I am his brother, and I love him very much.
The dog returns to its own vomit, and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle.” You’d take anything for a mistress.
Young though I am, I’ve been observing these three blowhards closely.
But leave it all to God.
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen.
I’ll fix you, I swear.
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped.
But if you see a wheel going uphill, latch on for the ride.
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much?
Now I’m afraid we’ve lost your son forever.
Her curses have made my hair stand on end.
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown.
I don’t have a lord.
Not even one success?
I’ll cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment when their tears are dry.
Cambio.
The curfew-bell rang.
Yes, pilgrim—they have lips that they’re supposed to pray with.
Only when they’re dead can I start to count my gains.
I’ll do it right away.
You shouldn’t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father.
Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation!
Don’t stand there shocked.
Lucius, who’s that knocking?
No, if they try to lead us to harm, I will leave the dance floor at the next song.  
That whore?
How could I honorably give him what I’ve already given you?
Where’s that music coming from?
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones!
Here are forty ducats.
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is, to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity.
If the world were mine, I’d give it all up—everything except Demetrius—to be you. 
What do you say, my fair  I do not know dat.
What “passion”?
Truthfully, my name is Cinna.
No, it’s dreadfully steep.
I know it’s the moon.
If that’s true, it makes up for all the sorrows I’ve ever known.
But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while.
What’s the matter?
Hold your tongue.
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend, and every one of them knows my name.
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband.
Peter, wait for me at the gate.
Then sure ones.
Go find out the news.
And then she brought me up, and I thank her for that, too.
I tell you, they are not honest men.
That’s too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it’s poetic.
A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would— Would do what?
When we’re born, we cry because we’ve arrived on the stage of life, like all the other fools.
You don’t love me.
Speak once again.
Listen!
It’s too bad.
My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money.
That’s true, they are.
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds, while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting.
Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony.
Oh, Kent, what could I ever do to become as good as you are?
There was even more foolishness, if I could only remember it.
What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city?
Stay here for a moment.
I’m going to rest my head on this little slope.
You gave money to me?
I’ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years.
What, you mean my face looks like a crab-apple?
Oh, he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher.
He’s going to look like a total idiot.
Go away!
Not now.
You won’t be seeing anything.—Hold his chair still, men.—I’m going to put my foot on his eyes.
If he can keep it, he’ll be set forever.
Send me away?
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave?
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins.
What you just said may perhaps be true.
Why does it matter that I’m not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited?
Look what I have here.
Your mother was extremely virtuous, and she said you were my daughter.
And how do you like Lord Bassanio’s wife?
Be honest and helpful, and I’ll repay you for your efforts.
Now I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated.
Will you say grace, sweet Kate, or shall I?—What is this?
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings.
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
I really think it was him.
Let’s have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises.
Get out of here, good Fleance, run, run, run!
What are you doing?
When I’ve revealed my true identity, you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out.
Listen a minute.
Hurry, Messala, and I’ll look for Pindarus in the meantime.
You can have what you want.
We’re sitting ducks for the French, if they only knew it, for there is no one guarding it but boys.
You don’t look well, Antonio.
Please, sir, be patient.
Now start the music, and sing the solemn hymn.
Think like this all day, and you’ll learn how to curse.
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim?
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy!
If not, then this parting was well done.
That can’t be.
But who is that?
Give me your blessing.
Yes, I do.
Don’t come again to ask for my ransom, good messenger.
Ah, Juliet if you’re as happy as I am, and you’re better with words, tell me about the happiness you imagine we’ll have in our marriage.
I wish I knew what is happening.
The Lord keep him from the title of king!
As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you.
Shylock, they’re offering you three times the money you lent.
Well, you’ve given away all your other rightful titles.
I will go straight to visit him.
As I vowed, I will unite the York and Lancaster families.
Although I can’t make his ship disappear, I can still make his journey miserable.
Gone?
But I see you’re troubled.
What’s the matter with you now?
I never saw him like this before.
They say that this town is full of deception—illusionists that can fool the eye, dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind, soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body, disguised swindlers, fast-talking fakers, and all kinds of other unchecked sins.
My dear lord, tell me what’s bothering you.
Goodbye, sir.
If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place.
The taming school?
I’d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman.
Who’s there?  
Please, tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say.
I could be convinced if I were like you.
If he asks to see me, tell him I’m sick and went to bed.
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back—though you may accuse me of boasting—I could easily get myself a wife.
They’re really being spoken, sir, and they’re true.
She says that you should come to her.
I’d follow you to the gates of Hell, you sneaky little devil!
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves.
Your master and his servant are here.
You are dead!
Tranio, I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath.
You’re a king’s advisor.
I think he got his jacket in Italy, his tights in France, his hat in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
When he regained consciousness again, he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong, he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness.
I have the best armor in the world.
followed you on your sad wanderings, ever since your bad luck began.
Edmund, where’s your wicked brother?
Look behind you, my lord.
There’s no room for the old man and his followers.
I’ve made a risky investment.
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears?
Your logic is so foolish.
First rehearse your song from memory, and make sure each note is pretty.
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything.
Yes, ma'am, we have.
If you can shape up, you’re welcome to stay in the house.
Play the music.—Take my hands, my queen, and we’ll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing. 
Yes, I really think so.
It’s a trick to confuse us.
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer.
Keep a little bit of honesty, even if you’re afraid.
If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an oath with you again.
So cheer up, there’s still hope for you, man.
What’s the matter?
Educated men are so impressive!
Out.
But tell me what you’re fighting about.
Take it back.
March to the bridge.
You’ll be my witness that I’ve been forced, as Pompey was, to wager all of our freedoms on one battle.
Before I learn how to love, I’ll learn how to follow orders.
fast and pray to stave off temptations.
I hope this play is well cast now.
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness.
I’m wounded.
Come on, you’re being too hard on yourself.
She’d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit.
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five?
I’ll go back to sleep now.
Would you mind if we woke up the king?
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves—wait a minute there, Morocco, and consider your own value with a level head.
The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are.
My meaning  And I 
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
No, I’ll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail.
Yes, heavily.
Why have you come here in such a mob?
It’s almost fairy time.
Conquer, crush, conclude, and kill!
Who talks of my nation?
What else did you hear?
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater.
I’ll stand, and so will Trinculo.
We’re near his room now.
That would be a little extreme!
Othello?
So, thank God, there is no real need for me, as I wouldn’t be able to help you much.
Since I’m suddenly all the rage, it will be worth the cost.
Tell me, if your dark powers can see this far: will Banquo’s sons ever reign in this kingdom?
I’d like to introduce you to my friend.
I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast!
No, he refused it publicly, in open court.
We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he.
Oh, sin can disguise itself so artfully!
I have no opinion about him.
The world’s a liar.
Murder!
It was a good and lucky vision.
For lead?
What do you mean by “furniture”?
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold.
Is your name Shylock?
This news will comfort Cassius.
If I let myself do what I yearn to, I’d rip the flesh off your bones.
Go away and take your children.
To die for adultery?
You shouldn’t talk about him like that!
Isn’t she a well-mannered young lady?
Whether you bite to kill, Mastiff, greyhound, or ugly mutt,
Some other time.
None, my lord.
I wish you could!
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides.
I swear he’s the better dog.
Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine.
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night.
The Jew will have justice.
What a horrible day!
Well, all right then.
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room, with the stinking water covering them up to their chins.
It’s a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea.
Too bad it fell flat.
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you.
If I die before you do make sure I’m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin.
I’m not possessed!
If she rants, I’ll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
No, you’d answer, “The slaves are ours.” And that’s just how I’m answering you.
We have God and a good cause on our side.
Cheers, boys.
Why are you talking like this?
Oh, I’m very scared something awful has happened.
They’re on the march.
That part is up to you.
But now we don’t have to!
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts.
You’ll get a blow from me for that, I think.
There, take it all back—plates, cups, the whole thing.
She’s ready to go, but she’ll never return. 
I’ll get the general’s surgeon.
And because I know how fond she is of music, playing her instruments, and poetry, I plan to hire live-in tutors for her.
Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great?
Look, my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him.
You’ll just have to be patient for a little while.
Cheer up, because I think you’re going to hell.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy.
A wise man and a fool.
No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff.
Be silent and go in.
You stupid cop, stop your violence!
Farewell, kind lord.
You don’t?
Don’t you 
Trinculo, watch out.
Horny animals!
In God’s name, I beg you not to wish for one more man.
All my pretty little children?
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom.
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before.
Oh, damn her, damn her!
Well, I’m sorry for your niece.
Tell me, spirit, how’s the king and his entourage?
Good Hermia, please don’t act so bitter toward me.
Thank you very much.
For three months, hmmm.
This is healthy talk.
My man Grumio!
If you’d been as wise as you were bold, With an old man’s mature judgment, You wouldn’t have had to read this scroll.
Hurry, you slave!
You’re acting like an ass, don’t you think?
And he’s not going to do any tomorrow.
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
Oh, but there’s one more thing to tell you.
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself.
Yes, he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life.
A  What’s going on?
Why, then, it’s my body’s doomsday.
But jealous people don’t think like that.
And just for today, Oh, Lord, just today don’t think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown!
I’ve spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia.
Here’s what you’ll do.
Until her beautiful life’s end.
Why, would that have fixed my hair?
Our poor father, Clarence!
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking.
Well then.
All three of us will marry now in death.
I promise I’ll carry the wood faster.
We are all made of dreams, and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
As eagerly as I ever came from school.
Oh, horror, horror, horror!
That’s not fair.
But silence, like a knife, cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood.
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet.
I like the morning.
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity?
Madam, please let me see your face.
What are you doing, wearing your best clothes?
He doesn’t speak Latin, French, or Italian, and you know how little English I speak.
He’s not getting anything except the penalty.
He will live as a cursed man.
Good morning, Catesby.
Have my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized?
I’ve got you now, pagan.
Run, run, my lord.
Then I’ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow.
It’s good we’re doing this.
One more thing, sir.
I’ll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that.
But all of you, remember what you’ve said and prove yourselves true Romans.
Yes, sir, I’m here.
It’s time for me to go.
For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl!
You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.
But come, my lord, let’s go.
Sister, be happy in my unhappiness.—Sir, I will humbly obey you.
What time is it?
And you, sir, what’s  Well, compared to a fine workman, you might call me a mere cobbler.
Please, stop bowing, good sir.
Pish to you, you mangy dog, you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt.
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here.
We must not.
Hello, Roderigo!
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for?
I’m starting to feel murderous urges.
Will it be in thunder, lightning, or rain?
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse.
What, was I married to her in a dream?
He must be very near by now.
Come here, monster, put some glue on your fingers, and carry away the rest of these clothes for us.
Look, here comes the woman you love.
Yes, you would beg, if you were in my position.
Stop whining, devil.
Let me go.
The moral of this story is that it’s not enough to speak; you have to speak grammatically.
Oh, well, stay till then!
I’ll wait over here.
I won’t tolerate him.
If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work.
Knock, sir?
She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft!
And you, go call my fool.
I’d give it all up—yes, I’d sacrifice them all to this devil here—to save you.
Let this anger sharpen your sword.
To repay her for her troubles, Death Gives her undying fame.
It sang about my crimes.
So they think it’s a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment—two strong preventive medicines that foster long life.
Therefore it’s certain that he wasn’t ambitious.
Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on your face?
Well, do what you want.
It applies to you as much as to me, my lord.
If you’re the lady of the house, then it’s true you’re stealing your role, because what’s yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself.
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet?
Well, let’s get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish.
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize, my horse would be a topic for them all.
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights.
I heard the galloping of horses.
Give me too much of it, so I’ll get sick of it and stop loving.
It’s a big prize for such a small sin.
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me, you try to take advantage of my affection.
You unwashed farmworker!
Good night, lieutenant.
Are you crazy?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.
When fools cry, you remain stony.
I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear.
Come on.
I’d like to think all men have some hope.
You’ll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing.
Now that the wind is favorable, let’s board the ship.
Everything’s fine.
There’s no need to be, really, for—  You’re my teacher, so I must believe you.
Oh, it’s too bad!
He’ll tell them so.
Oh, sad day!
On, on, on, on, on!
Is the throne empty?
Didn’t I meet up with your allies?
Duke of Burgundy, if you want peace, the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe, you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands.
Second, he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies.
I’ll tell you, Cassius, you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold.
If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you again, and do everything I can.
That’s the way to show me friendship.
No, advancement to the dignity and height of honor, to a high, imperial kind of glory.
Won’t the ladies be scared of the lion?
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman, taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures.
Don’t refuse it.
Now in the factory of thought, create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets.
Yes, it is, I think.
I swear that gown’s for me.
Accept it in body and spirit.
You wrong me even more, sir, by denying it.
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him, the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child, and both princes would still be alive, not preyed on by worms.
Let’s discuss it some more.
No, I’ll be patient.
We’ll do what you want us to, my lord.
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage?
No, calm down.
Some  Now listen, either give me my ring or give me the necklace.
By Jesus, he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world.
You should have reprimanded him for that.
You’re not thinking of leaving tonight, surely?
I recognize his trumpet.
Why did you leave the dining room?
You lie.
It’s too much.
Excuse me, my lord?
God help me!
Look at the stars, see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold.
Macbeth is ripe for the picking.
The people fear me in the country and the town.
She was too good for me.
He’s rushing on his way here right now, and Regan’s with him.
Yes, Desdemona.
I swear, anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester’s apprentice.
I’m just wandering, with no particular destination.
Petruchio, let’s stand over here awhile.
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world: when we’re down and out—often because of our own excesses —we put all the blame on the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if they forced us to be bad, or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid.
I said you had a fine wit.
I know you.
Tell him that when our noble father, the duke of York, gave his three sons his blessing, he never imagined that our friendship would come to this.
He died on Viola’s thirteenth birthday.
If this letter’s right, you’ve got a lot to deal with.
My father’s dead, and his fortune is mine now.
This is  It is, my lord.
I won’t argue with her, so her beautiful body won’t disarm me.—Tonight, Iago.
Is this a dagger I see in front of me, with its handle pointing toward my hand?   
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us.
I think it’s too rough, too rude, too rowdy, and it pricks like a thorn.
And if anything important happens, find me and let me know.
What’s he talking about?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you?
But I’ll admit I don’t care for you.
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers, and you wouldn’t give it to me.
And now they’re both gone.
How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even see?
There’s a ransom.
Go away and stay apart from me.
It’s good you hunted for yourself, sir.
What’s this?
Believe me, King of Illusions, I made a mistake.
And that’s what you want me to do!
And to hell with drowning yourself!
I’ll think it over.
What’s going on here?
He’s given me a second life, and marrying her makes him a second father to me.
I explained how you were deceived, how you were thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did it!” You explained it all.
Let’s go.
For love to appear in his true likeness, he would have to be as Cupid is: naked and blind.
Of brave earls, Grandpré and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix, Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.
But I won’t let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows.
I pardon that man.
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.” That’s like saying, “Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying ‘thank you.’” If this doesn’t move me to take pity on her, I’m a horrible person.
Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus.
Do you hear, my friend?
Read your history!
You barely have the heart to tell me, so you can’t possibly have the nerve to do it.
It’s too frightened to look at itself.
You can heat your iron up in here.
He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” I’ll assume I deserve the very best.—Give me a key for this one.
Alas, my lord, your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom.
Fight valiantly today.
When I tell him he hates flatterers, he agrees, just at the moment when I’m flattering him the most.
Madam, I’m a bit like you in that I can’t tolerate a tone of disapproval.
We need some oracle to tell us what’s going on.
We’ll all join hands and sing, and bless this place with our fairy grace.    
Get me some ink, paper, and a candle.
If it isn’t my old friend Grumio—and my dear friend Petruchio!
I don’t think he wants to be disturbed.
Regan, I hope you didn’t know anything about that.—Ah, who’s this?
He’s been killed.
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way, and Cassio couldn’t let it pass.
It’s you we were laughing at.
Yes, he was born at Monmouth, Captain Gower.
No one except her maid and a holy hermit.
She was a hellcat in school.
Of course, sir.
He’s somewhere else in the house.
Why, sir, I spent it on this rope.
Oh, if you only knew how close to success you are, even while you make fun of what I’m telling you!
Let them come—I don’t care.
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden, or I’ll kick you out of my kingdom.
Pindarus!
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield.
Oh, no, he’s surely not in hell.
I’ll do anything rather than marry a drunk, Nerissa.
I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it.
My reputation, my reputation!
I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him.
I feel tortured by all this talking.
Remain calm until midnight, and then you’ll see what the trouble is.
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever, and will make me, Caliban, your worshipful foot-licker.
He’s done wrong, and his master the king will punish him for it.
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy?
Please go find out for certain who has arrived.
Thank you.
You’re my true and honorable wife, as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart.
Oh, goodbye to my peace of mind!
There’s nothing to fear in him.
What’s this?
Under Captain Gower, my liege.
What are you saying, mistress?
This doesn’t look like a wedding.
He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep.
Caliban!
When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am.
Hey, hurry up, hurry up!
It must be a spirit.
Anyway, I have to say goodbye to you now.
The king isn’t the one sending you to the Tower, Clarence.
I know the man a bit.
Men can be masters of their fate.
To prison, until you’re called into court.
That’s just what he said in the letter.
Is that true?
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen, that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed.
I wish to God that the golden crown that I’ll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain!
Let it fly out.
Take it to heart, Dorset.
I don’t feel anything.
It’s true, my lords, he did.
The same to you, my lord!
That’s comforting.
We don’t know.
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit.
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything.
Nobody was hurt in the slightest.
Swords don’t frighten me.
Who are you?
I will, my lord.
How did you know what happened to your poor father?
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it.
Oh, this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever.
And it’s all your fault.
My beautiful queen, we’ll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music.
Now, good sweet Nurse—Oh Lord, why do you look so sad?
If God had been willing, I wish we had died in the same hour too!
We are fortunate in the change.
She could even what?
Villain, you don’t know the laws of God or of man.
Good.
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio’s dead.
Get me some ink and paper, and hire some horses to ride.
Now, your gown?
But you had bad blood in you, no matter how much you learned, and good people couldn’t stand to be near you.
Can’t you wait for a moment?
Innocent sweethearts, you have no idea who’s responsible for your father’s death.
I haven’t done anything wrong.
On a night like this, young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much, stealing her heart with vows of love, but not one vow was true.
No!
Is she dead?
No, please, speak seriously.
What do you mean, beside yourself?
What do you think he wants?
Go forward.
And that’s how she died?
Goodbye, goodbye.
If things go well, bring the crowd to  I’m off.
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love.
Husband, I’ll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you’ve pulled.
Here’s the story we’ll tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow.
Drive it out of you.
I wish I had!
Ah, the countess is coming!
Go with me to the tomb.
Like hell she is!
What kind of man are you?
Keep an eye on him.
I will proclaim my name around the field.
Either be calm and polite or I’ll drown you out with the music of war.
You haven’t been conquered.
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio.
Your lives are over.
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
James Tyrrel—and your most obedient subject.
The king acts unnaturally—father against child.
You’ve lost your resolve.
Meanwhile, I’ll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge.
We need more help!
Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do.
And what would that accomplish?
She’s obedient—a fine lady.
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you, if I were a woman.
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it.
Take him to the surgeons.
I’m not staying here to argue anymore.
Be patient until I finish.
Get information from her.
Oh, please don’t swear, my lord of Buckingham.
There must be a strange explanation for this—if it’s true.
It’ll be lunchtime within an hour.
My God, it’s the same one I gave the judge!
My lord, I’ll say goodbye now.     
About as old as you are, my lord.
Sure thing, we’ll do it tomorrow morning.
You were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything.
What, are you crazy?
Besides, I have some business to take care of in town.
Tell me, rainbow, do you know if either Venus, the goddess of love, or her son, Cupid, is accompanying Queen Juno?
How many people who are humble now would be great then?
And let me kill Cassio.
Please wear this ring.
You may have lost his respect, but so have I.
What did he say?
Just a bit of my dry humor, sir.
Ha, ha, ha!
Cassio’s a handsome man.
Amen!
Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it.
He was the one who denounced his father.
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury.
Either there are wars in heaven, or else the world, too insolent toward the gods, provokes them to send destruction.
I’m not going to eat dinner tonight.
What kind of game is this?
Oh, help!
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister.
She’ll be buried with her face upwards, then.
I wonder if you’d be so good, you lousy, rotten villain, to grant my wish and my request and gratify me, see, by eating this leek.
I agree.
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy, arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was—my trust which had no limit, an infinite confidence.
No, none that you’re smart enough to make.
Yes, my lord.
Besides, the king’s name is a tower of strength; the opposition doesn’t have that advantage.
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding.
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love.
Oh I hope that’s not true!
If our secret’s known, either Caesar or I will die, for I’ll kill myself.
Can he deny it?
Come talk to me about this.
Here’s another, stronger than the first.
If you choose the one that contains my picture, we’ll be married right away.
There’s no point in looking for him if he doesn’t want to be found.
Yes, my lord.
Are you going to Scone?
I’ll pay you for your trouble.
Here, catch this box.
And here he is.
Iago’s a good man.
Yes, but no doctor can help me.
Amen to that.
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string.
Do you know them?
They certainly will.
Sir Thomas Erpingham.
Now, soldiers, advance.
Leave all the rest to me.
No, you’re just taunting me.
When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you.
I don’t know why he’s come here.
Why only a few courtiers, my lord of Buckingham?
The level meadow, where the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover once grew, has become useless: unmowed, it grows to seed, so that nothing springs up but weeds, rough thistles, barren plants, and burs.
Let him be for a bit.
Go ahead.
I don’t know his name.
But oh, what a deceiver he turned out to be!
I don’t like sports.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you’ll find me in a grave.
Where is our entertainment director?
Didn’t you just say he was?
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason.
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects.
A nice coincidence, my lord.
You’re older than me.
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I’m innocent?
Are you a god?
Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie.
And when he strikes back at you, he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there.
I will have it all mine.
Turn right at the next turn, but at the following turn, turn left.
Is that true, my lords of England?
I don’t know what to say.
Good luck, sir.
Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son.
I’m not moving an inch, pal.
I’m just stating the facts as I see them.
That she did.
Would it be better if I were that, instead of what I am?
Yes, my lord.
Macbeth has come.
Well then, improve your situation with a show of courage.
Look, here comes just the man we were looking for.
That’s me.
He’s not wise enough to be brave.
Go look for him.
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork.
I tell you, I’ll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing.—Go on, bite.
Too bad it’s spoiling our pleasure tonight.
How’s my nephew doing, noble lord of York?
Lady, did you sleep in her room last night?
You weren’t given any gold?
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes, my lord.
Mistress, your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister’s room.
Your wives, your daughters, your old women, and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust.
Get out of my sight!
Maybe he’s not feeling well.
In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake.
I’m afraid that may be the case, madam.
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool.
Just looking at you makes me sick.
My lord, you don’t need to apologize.
Oh, lady, speak again.
I wonder what it means.
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet.
You know that the style of a man’s jacket or hat or coat means nothing.
And don’t we have passions, and a taste for fun, and weaknesses, just like men?
Tell me.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.
Then do so, with all your heart.
You’ll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight.
But did I fall or not?
How do you know he loves her?
Now, herald, have the dead been counted?
The son ran away.
Don’t worry, man, I won’t try to escape.
It’s been eleven years since the earthquake.
You got to me first.
You’ll fight with a man who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes.
Yes, you did, sir.
If you are a devil, I won’t be able to kill you.
As they pass by, grab Casca by the sleeve, and he’ll tell you if anything important happened today—in his usual sour way.
Yes ,madam.
Come with us to Athens.
If she was young and passionate, she’d move as fast as a ball.
The more I pray, the less I get out of it.
That’s enough, Dromio, please.
Oh!
What is it, Biondello?
That’s right, she did.
I’d say I was “out of my element,” but that phrase is overused, so I’ll say I’m “out of my air.”
How do you know?
However, I’ll do what I can for you.
Women are like roses: the moment their beauty is in full bloom, it’s about to decay.
Listen, but don’t speak.
You’re this poor and wretched and still afraid to die?
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands.
Bring Desdemona here.
If you let her go this easily, Sir Andrew, you don’t deserve to ever use your sword again.
The best thing about me is that I’m hardworking.
I gave him no order.
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina.
Oh, Kate, prudish customs bow before great kings.
Dromio, what stuff of mine did you put on a ship?
That’s a nasty garter belt.
Thank you.
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men.
That’s all.
Hurry up, or I’ll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.
I’ll die  You’re of royal blood, and we obey you.
In bed with her?
It seems to me like we’re still sleeping, still dreaming.
I led them on in this frightened, distracted state, and left sweet
To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house.
Was there ever a match put together so quickly?
Let’s fall on our swords.
What would that be?
Thrice noble lord, I beg you to excuse me for another night or two—or at least until nightfall.
EPHESUS Now what do you think?
Oh, lovely.
If you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with you.
Don’t tell us what our duty is.
That rotten scoundrel! 
My lord, I’ll do it right away.
I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore.
It’s still a long time until daybreak.
You’re serious enough to know not to play games with Satan.
Well done!
Where have you been hiding?
Do you know Fluellen?
Listen, if you want a good laugh—and I mean a side-splitting one—then follow me.
No, he’s in a place worse than hell.
This is the air, that’s the glorious sun.
Haven’t you made your other love, Demetrius—who kicked me with his foot not long ago—call me a goddess and a divine, rare, precious, heavenly creature?
Meet me at the synagogue.
First of all, Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself, which the ladies in the audience won’t be able to stand.
What handkerchief?
I need to hear the truth about all this.
A husband?
Give me your hand.
I won’t say no to you, but let it be known that I’m only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life —I hear you were quickly wasting away without me.
It’s the former Hero!
Then we’ll call this the Battle of Agincourt, fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
If I answered that question, I’d be making confession to you.
The things men are allowed to do!
Good running, Thisbe!
I remember.
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news.
I think he’s actually serious, and not just being polite.
Did I work to make him king for this?
My own safety is the only important thing now.
Those who rush stumble and fall.
For shame, bring Juliet out here.
She’ll be here soon, just like her letter said.
Lucius!
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; Sir Gilbert Talbot; Sir William Stanley; Oxford; the highly feared Pembroke; Sir James Blunt; Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew; and many other famous and powerful noblemen.
Will you be here when I return?
I’m not in a joking mood.
But, hey, this doesn’t mean you’re looking to get married, does it?
What if this mixture doesn’t work at all?
Please don’t say no.
Casca will tell us what’s the matter.
Damn that Toby!
Hurry now, get the job done.
He’s as brave as a fox.
At his best he’s a little less than a man, and at his worst he’s little more than an animal.
Yes, I will.
Then, like prophets, they named him the father to a line of kings.
What’s the news abroad?
Why, a bad action is just a wrong in this world, but when you’ve won the whole world, it’s a wrong in your own world, so you can make it right then.
Your name is Lucentio, you say.
Sweet men, come to him.
For, as I am a soldier, the name I think suits me best, once I begin my attack on Harfleur again, I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes.
She lives about twenty miles from Athens, and she thinks of me as a son.
My lord loves you.
What’s his name?
I’m not Stephano, I’m a walking cramp.
Yes, if Messala recommends me to you.
Look in the almanac.
Angelo, the jeweler.
My clerk has some comforting news for you, too.
And trust me, love, you look pale to me too.
I tell you, man, it’s better for me, too, than the last time we met here.
Let’s leave him.
Now you say it was “Knock at the gate”?
Which one is Sebastian?
I pity your situation.
Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of tyranny.
I’m no more insane than you are, and I’ll prove it.
It’s a good shilling, I promise you.
You can hear them all night long.
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed.
But insincere men, like horses who are too lively at the start of a race, make a big show of their spirit.
Father, what’s the news?
My dear madam, why are you in mourning?
You won’t lose any respect.
You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off.
I swear— By nothing, because this is no oath.
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths, I wouldn’t be able to answer that.
That’s really news!
I make the laws, not you.
I had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I planned to say nothing more on the topic.
We were somewhere where I couldn’t pick a fight with him, but I’ve decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again, whereupon I’ll give him a little piece of my mind.
What are you saying, Cordelia?
So we should eat and drink.
I’ve got a plan that will fix everything.
Give us answers.
Where are you going?
Nothing that I know for sure, but a lot that I’m afraid might happen.
I’m not much of a drinker.
Here, sir!
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you, Ceres, goddess of the fields and the earth, to leave your rich farms of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and peas, the hills where the
You, Roderigo!
No gentlemen, don’t get ready to go now.
I didn’t think you could even be so angry.
Speak, my fair one, and speak fairly, I beg you.
She dropped it carelessly, and, seizing the opportunity, since I was here, I picked it up.
Tell her to come here.
I know that, sir.
No, that’s not it—it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed.
What does your grace want?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?
What performances have been prepared?
And the poor old man just wept, mixing his tears with the rain.
No, please, save it for dinner conversation.
What is that bloody knife?
Gracious Lord, blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again!
My soul is full of sorrow.
My lord?
What have I said in my grief?
Me, sir?
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy—your mother can vouch for that—and then he was betrothed to Bona, the King of France’s sister-in-law.
Tell us, old Egeon: are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia, who gave birth to two fair sons?
Has anyone offended your Worship?
Oh, and monsieur, be careful not to break the honey-sac.
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king?
Come, here’s some sauce to go with it.
You won’t stand and fight.
You can speak to me.
I’ll go get them, sir.  
Once at Sardis and once last night, here in Philippi fields.
No, you won’t get a word out of me.
If you make the accusation convincingly, then my cunning won’t fail me.
Somebody’s knocking.
will damage your reputation with them—and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre.
He’s not here.
I’ve sent twenty people to look for you.
I’m your daughter.
And what did he say?
That’s the way great men ought to endure great losses.
The British troops are coming near.
Come here, man.
You didn’t go to sleep, then?
Good-bye.
Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other?
Truly, madam, I don’t hear anything.
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings, and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps.
For God’s sake, Sir Toby, you’ve got to come home earlier at night.
Go ahead—say “Amen.” No more talking.
Their bodies may remain here in England, but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already.
That’s right, uncle, talk to your heart, like the  Good morning to you both.
Then that’s the way it’ll be.
I don’t want to go mad.
And so far I’m pleased with the way things have turned out, since I find all of this commotion very entertaining.
From the highest to the lowest of you, I bid you a hearty welcome.
Of course I hear it.
What was the second noise for?
I am the youngest man by that name, because there is no one younger, or worse.
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face?
I remember.
Really?
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes.
Do you need my help?
Ring the alarm bell.
Know him?
They certainly do like to butt heads!
If a bloody head counts as a hurt, then you hurt me.
It was me, no one else.
Amen to that!
Enough.
Nothing, my lord.
Good morning, noble sir.
I’ll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react however they want.
Father, go ahead.
Saints don’t move, even when they grant prayers.
Oh, sad day!
You’re lying, you shaggy-haired villain!
What mistress do you have?
I can’t tell you anything else.
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes.
It was.
What do you mean I faked you out?
Do they come from good families?
This is what happens when you visit whores.
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep.
Raise all the money you can.
What?
I demand to be satisfied.
Come here!
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy.
I swear to you, many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before.
it pleases you, I’ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime.
Get up, get up, and look at this image of doomsday!
Oh, noble Caesar!
I want my bond, so stop talking.
Has it been so long?
If she lives a long and happy life, then all women may as well turn into monsters.
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love.
And he did.
I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment.
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king.
Tell him he’s not going to speak with me.
Please go back to Goneril’s house.
Arrest me if you dare.
What’s this all about?
Is it a beggar?
Okay, but tonight doesn’t count.
Bolstered by righteousness, I prepared to fight, and when he saw my excitement—or perhaps because my shouting scared him—he ran away suddenly.
So I will, my liege.
Let’s all sink with the king.
If he’s not in love with a woman, then you can’t trust the usual symptoms.
Go back again, slave, and bring him home.
There’s hardly a bush for miles around.
You hit my servants, and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants.
Hey, lady!
You never heard of the Centaur?
Please, give my regards to your mother, Mrs. Peapod, and your father, Mr. Peapod.
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to.
If she punishes you, master, she’s sure to punish me.
I’ll be damned if the duke wouldn’t have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus. 
I’m done for.
Well then, you must be in love.
Will you break my heart?
Your eyes are playing tricks on you.
Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time.
Around nine o'clock, madam.
If you wish.
I’ll make you sing.
Unfaithful?
Her father is Baptista Minola, a pleasant and courteous gentleman.
Quiet, there!
I just speak directly.
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban’s sheep—Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham’s birthright, because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir— What’s your point?
I’ll go my own way.
You bastards!
Our knocking woke him up.
Is Othello angry?
You’re both very precious to me.
Run as if your life depended on it.
When I have the juice of that flower, I’ll trickle some drops of it on Titania’s eyes while she’s sleeping.
Wish me luck.
Tell me so I can be satisfied.
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this, madam?
Absolutely.
Indeed, the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they’ll beat us, they have such an army.
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves, and I will be king for my entire natural life.
I tell you, though, it’s incredible how much she loves me.
It’s a lie, you thread, you thimble, you measurement!
In my soul, I believe Hero has been falsely accused.
As you all know, overconfidence is man’s greatest enemy.
What’s that noise?
But with you it’s different.
Even if you’re not a traitor, you’re going to look like one if you run away.
Are they all ready?
He’s dead.
Your friend,      Artemidorus.” I’ll stand here until Caesar passes by, and I’ll give him this as though it’s a petition.
No, you shall not.
Gouge out his eyes!
I’ll give you the most expensive ring in Venice, and I’ll make a public announcement to help me find it.
You see, her eyes are open.
I thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
I’m going to let him live.
Not yet.
Yes, and I’ll keep crying a while longer.
Good morning, brother Bedford.
Sweet Desdemona!
I’ll follow you, my lord.
We should definitely say something to the Moor.
Listen to you!
But step aside, fairy!
Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms.
Go, take your sweetheart and leave him to me.
Is supper ready?
Tell him not to send any more messengers—unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news.
Her grapes, which make the wine that cheers our hearts, die unpruned on the vines.
As a favor to  Nope.
She’s a fine woman, all right.
Hello, sir!
Please, give it to me. 
No.
Did you find my daughter?
You don’t want to eat, sir?
Caesar, the clock has struck eight.
What did he do to you?
Name one.
Meanwhile, let’s go to bed and dream about this.
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand.
I’m very glad.
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late.
I can’t see ahead of me.
Peter, did you ever see anything like it?
Agreed.
Here come the lovers, laughing happily.—I wish you joy, my friends!
Well, we can put away our pipes and go home.
There’s no power in Venice that can change an established decree.
Then, rejecting my request, you kill 
So that England may live a long life like this, let God say amen!
For you, I give myself away and I’m ecstatic about the exchange.
What if I am?
The night’s too rough for humans to bear.
I must hide in the darkness for awhile.
The fool’s a good actor.
To be brief—as the occasion requires—prepare to fight early in the morning, when your future will be decided.
Very well, ma'am.
There’s nothing else.
He’s asking him to tell the story again.
Yes, very well.
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you’re a relative, she doesn’t approve of your behavior.
You have a daughter named Elizabeth, who is virtuous and beautiful, aristocratic and full of grace.
She’s been dead for some time.
Look, I don’t love you, so stop following me around.
It’s arranged.
Do you want my true opinion?
We shouldn’t displease him.
How dare    What, is the man crazy?
What, is he dead?
Then I rebel against you, stars!
I’d rather kill myself.
I’m at your service.
What’s important is the urgency of this mission.
Let him run far away.
Can you blame him?
I only want idiots following my advice, the advice of a fool.
Yes, you did.
She was utterly true to you!
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles, sewing it on one piece of cloth, sitting on the same cushion, singing one song in the same key, as if our hands, our sides, our voices and our minds were stuck together.
Don’t worry about me.—Your sister and the duke are here.
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone.
No.
Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what.
Wait, and listen to me, countrymen.
But what about your guilty conscience?
We’ll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi.
I bet I’ve been wrong about myself all this time.
We’ve been looking for him everywhere.
We’ll have supper in the morning.
You and I, Kate, we are the makers of custom, and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize, as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss.
Show.
I loved him, as much as any father ever loved his son.
Go walk the path that you will never return from.
And this is Metellus Cimber.
Oh painful sympathy!
Then how will we see their own natural tears?
The storm separated us.
True, if a fool such as yourself could find it.
Not yet, cousin.
When an evil thing has been lost, no one cries.
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos, in a carriage pulled by doves.
What’s this, you dog?
I’ll wear this one and none other.
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing, because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe.
Is there a murderer here?
But, unfortunately, Caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him.
Thank you.
I’ll do it.
Do promise, Kate, that you’ll do your French part to bring forth such a boy; and for my English half, take the word of a king and a bachelor.
What, from myself?
Yes, or to wear cosmetics?
So, where’s my wife?
I don’t deny it.
Damn you for teaching me your language!
If you were the noblest of your family, young man, you couldn’t die more honorably.
By God, I am not selfish when it comes to money: I don’t care who eats at my expense.
The fight is between our masters, and we men who work for them.
Good evening, good evening.
Oh, he’s a gallant king!
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear.
Are you this impatient?
Has it come to this?
I hate my name, dear saint, because my name is your enemy.
He has always loved Cordelia best, and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious.
Give me one,” I said.
And, make no mistake, you’ll find, as we his subjects have, an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now.
Your grace, please forgive me.
You’ll have to leave tonight.
My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
There’s always a breath of fresh air here.
Yes, my lady.
But I’ll punish them thoroughly.
Do you think it would work?
I won’t trouble you so much as to wake you.
Take this.
These are gracious tears.
Look at you getting all riled up!
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately.
Ranting and raving to my own shadow!
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man?
As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin.
That was a humorous message.
Good-bye to you, the last of all the Romans.
Allow me to continue.—I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, who, hearing of your daughter’s beauty and wit, her friendly disposition and bashful modesty, her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior, have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I’ve heard is true.
Do you love me?
Who’d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird?
Come, then, and send his body to Thasos.
Meet me in a little while at the citadel.
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well, but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason.
And you’re my husband, right?
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead.
Nonsense!
Oh, no, that was my lady’s voice.
I swear, sir, you did not eat at home.
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea, and my love is as deep.
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever.
I’ve got no food to give you.
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart.
Can’t a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick, sneaky lowlifes?
Read the will.
It has leaked out that you’re hiding here.
You’re right.
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself.
Is that you, wife?
Oh, it’s horrible of her.
The world doesn’t make laws to make you rich.
Dorset, embrace Hastings.—Hastings, express your affection for the marquess of Dorset.
Stand up if you’re really a man.
No.  
But she must be, Friar.
What do you think that means?
She’s probably right.
It’s obvious:  Here comes Biondello.
This fight will decide who dies.
But let her live.
God bless you!
What’s going on here, you secret, evil, midnight hags?
You’re not in love either?
How does he love me?
I will confess it to all the world.
I’m speaking for the king, but I look like myself.
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women?
What does the golden box say?
As for me, I’ll leave when I like.
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose?
Did she see you there the whole time, old boy?
Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone.
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight.
What can I do for you?
I, sir, am Dromio.
You are not, Cassius.
You, I think, would best know what he’s thinking.
I know my rights.
But be quiet, here comes Thisbe.
My lord of Gloucester, I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long.
I admit I’m only a woman, but nevertheless I’m the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife.
When the vision passes, you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool.
Speak, if you can.
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely, but I won’t stay in any case.
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave.
While I waited, I’d frown impatiently, and perhaps wind my watch, or play with my—with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing.
I’ll take you to where he sleeps, and you can pound a nail into his head.
Thursday it is, then. 
Why, that man is a total fraud and rascal.
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God!
Yes, sir.
Ungodly and monstrous!
What’s this song?
I’m not in the mood.
You’re going to ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats.
Then my love is humble.
He followed you.
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers, just like unicorns can be captured in trees, elephants in holes, and lions with nets.
Beat him up.
The sight of them is offensive.
Just let me say one prayer!
Take that, and that.
And when the mind is engaged, the rest of the body, dead and dull before, wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity, like a snake shedding its dead skin.
To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way.
If you say one more word, I’ll punish you, maybe even hate you.
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy.
I might come back soon.
If I told you that, what would I get out of it?
I’m so amazed by this, I don’t know what to say.
To see an elderly, unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus.
I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.
I don’t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is.
Go ahead, swear to that, so you’ll be damned to hell for lying.
Go.
Tell me.
Suffolk died first, and York, cut to pieces, came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face, kissing his gashes.
Why, madam, have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king?
How are you, my friend?
Her only flaw—and it’s a big one—is that she’s unbearable, a total witch, so much so that I wouldn’t think of marrying her myself, not even if I were in a worse fix than I am, not for a whole goldmine.
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped.
This must be some kind of fairyland.
I’ve got the whole barrel, man.
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point?
My good lords, I plan to.
I’ll head to France soon.
Honest, my lord?
You’re right.
But then he said strange things to me.
Is there more work to do?
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit.—Regan, I’m bleeding.
Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you.
Then you and I and all of us fell down, while bloody treason triumphed.
I beg you, remember the good work I’ve done for you, and how I’ve never lied to you, never made mistakes, and never grumbled in my work.
Would I send a lie?
And what is that music?
It isn’t proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you.
I can’t offer her more than all I have.
Come on, servant, come.
The  Right.
You didn’t offend us, you offended the king.
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain, let’s think about the worst that may happen.
And the greatest sorrow is mine too.
God will take revenge.
Nobody will hurt us.
He plans to leave tomorrow.
Get away from me!
Nothing, sir, except grandchildren.
The king’s son, Ferdinand, with his hair standing straight up—it looked like reeds, not hair—was the first person to jump, shouting, “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here!” Good job!
You gentle Romans— Quiet there!
If I said something, she’d mock me so mercilessly that I’d probably disintegrate into air.
Noble people don’t answer to peasants!
I’ll pull on these smaller legs.
Don’t hurt me, please.
Sinful Macduff, they were killed because of you!
How is she doing?
Why, you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman.
Is that so?
Don’t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord’s anointed king.
It’s nine o'clock!
My happiness and yours lie in her.
No, of course you don’t.
This is Antonio, my dearest friend.
Sir, I tell you that we are not.
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone.
And there’s another storm brewing—I can hear it in the way the wind whistles.
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began, “Wonder of nature—” I have heard a sonnet to one’s mistress that began like that.
If your wife’s not a madwoman, and you tell her how much I deserve this ring, she won’t stay angry at you forever if you give it to me.
Now that you speak of paper, I remember a funny story of Hero’s.
Now let me see if I can translate it.
I’ve found it out.
Thieves!
You won’t be wasting your time, because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music, so he’ll be happy to have me in his service.
Don’t you know he has?
Let’s go forth, dear countrymen.
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine.
A hundred and sixty-eight hours?
But what do you say to my request?
It is.
I must admit your offer is the best.
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes, and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon.
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away.
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off.
What is she saying, my lord?
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you, when he loves you so deeply?
See—I’ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name.
Tear him to pieces.
Listen, I hear them.
Come this way, my lord.
I don’t care what you think of me.
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet.
Come, Ariel—I summon you with a thought.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
How can they refuse to speak with me?
I’ll go and coach them.
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy, I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence.
Is this face Hero’s?
Hurry up, hurry up.
Ah, how pitiful!
And when she left just now, she said “Take care of this poor fellow here.” Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” not anything referring to my low station in life, but “fellow.” Everything’s going perfectly.
Now, daughter Katherine?
Wait until I read the letter.
Oh cousin, cousin!
Oh, immortal gods!
Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?
I’m here.
Then repeat this after me: you can’t expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.
What woman’s servant?
He brings great news.
But I’ll open the curtain and let you see the picture.
Get out of that position, because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop.
My money’s almost run out.
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano’s talking about, because he never lets me get a word in.
True.
I will die and leave Death everything.
But who’s with him?
There may be a time for everything, but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back.
Because who is this man they follow?
Uncle, I’m coming out!
His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can’t fly high with his cheerful feathers.
Yes, gentle cousin, if it were light enough for you.
I swear, he’ll be food for the crows soon.
Where are you, Demetrius, you arrogant bastard?
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him.
I’d second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista’s youngest daughter.
You should know this: much luck is on my side, and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island.
It was yesterday, your highness.
Show yourself in the form of a sigh.
No, she’s worse: she’s the devil’s mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench.
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
We’ll draw straws.
You’re smart, though, and if you were sick, you’d take what you needed to get better.
Tomorrow night, when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light (the time of night that always hides runaway lovers), we plan to sneak out of Athens.  
He will have only justice and his penalty.
So, in that case, tell me who’s next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples?
But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him.
It’s—But he’s drowned, and these guys are devils.
What a poor, gullible monster.—That was a nice big gulp, monster!
Confess and love” is more like it.
He’ll make your palace tremble for this insult, even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe.
No, no more than is reasonable.
Huh!
We have consented to all reasonable terms.
Say something.
Let those who will hear me speak stay.
I look forward to getting to know you better.
The servants Macbeth killed.
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole.
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield.
She picks it up quick, doesn’t she?
Oh, that arrow was well shot.
Please pardon our brother Clarence.
I’ll be your wife if you’ll have me.
As for the rest of the ships, I scattered them, and they’ve gathered again in the Mediterranean, sailing sadly home to Naples, believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king.
No–the law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself.
Oh, please, Prince Dauphin!
He’s walking ahead of me, and he keeps daring me to follow him.
I asked you again, and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently.
I’ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales.
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things.
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace.
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak.
Indeed, I would have such an exploit for you, Ligarius, if you were healthy enough to hear it.
He’s thirty years old.
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio.
Has anyone seen Cesario?
Juliet lies here, and her beauty fills this tomb with light.
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country.
If that’s the case, tears wash my eyes more than hers.
If your highness is willing, take revenge on him for that—because I know you’re brave enough, I don’t dare to— That’s for sure.
I’ve got her now, but I’ve got God to thank for it!
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you.
I’ll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I’d run from a bear.
You don’t need eyes to see how the world works.
There’s no one else here.
Struggling with the wind and rain.
If any ships are sailing, I’ll get right on one.
Please lie down and rest a while, my lord.
If you want to come have dinner with me, you can.
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this?
Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a  Enough, enough!
They’re forgiven, then, if they don’t see what they’re doing.
Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad?
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Oh, how bitter it is that Edward—the real “true, noble prince”—should still be alive!
I don’t know what to say.
I beg your 
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.
You seem all right now.
And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones!
Why are you asking me that?
I can’t believe that.
What could you possibly ask for?
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today.
Oh, please, I’m begging you, don’t mention him again.
They’ll set their watches to whatever time we say.
When she put it on my finger, she made me swear never to sell it, give it away, or lose it.
You’ve forgotten the will I told you about.
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely?
You’re defending an impostor?
But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far, because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, I’ll keep going.
Damn you!
I have news, ma'am.
Take my sword.
I’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought.
To find you.
I said so, dear Katherine, and I’m not ashamed to repeat it.
And, when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom you know I hate, rather than Paris.
Tonight I’m having a feast that we’ve celebrated for many years.
Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask.
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well, and now I need your help again.
While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here.
If I live through this, I’ll be good to you.
It’s incredible—they didn’t say a word.
Is it now afternoon?
I pick the younger one.
And  I feel that I love her.
Be quiet and listen to me.
Listen, Dardanius.
But I’ll go in.
What’s with you, my lord?
So here’s the plan.
I’ll do the best I can, my lord.
You call yourself my wife, yet you don’t call me “husband”?
Here comes the good Macduff.
What’s the news?
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray?
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest?
How can you blame her, a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes, for objecting to having a blind, naked boy appear before her?
Sir, sir, calm down.
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew?
Don’t you have any respect for anything?
Right now?
She’s only sad when she sleeps—and not even then.
Cut off their heads?
So long.
No I don’t, believe me.
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart.
Another studpid answer!
Why?
Where?
Who’s there?
As a wandering lunatic, he can do whatever he wants.
How unlucky am I, having to apologize for doing the right thing!
How long has he been there?
It’s nice to see children playing well together.
It seems not.
Cassio’s not dead?
Treat Desdemona well.
Pretty York, who told you about his teeth?
This much I can say about him: he is well-born, has proven his bravery in battle, and has established his good character.
Farewell, farewell!
Aren’t you dead yet?
You call it my “ Don’t you know?
Leave him alone.
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly?
Yes.
He’s talking with the bogus father about the bogus son.
What can possibly fix this situation?
Where is that damned wretch, Tranio, who defied me in such a disgraceful manner?
Did you just call me “beautiful”?
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks?
The Duke’s in a meeting?
How can I help you?
Romeo, are you crazy?
I’ll help you through this business.
But as for this ring, please excuse me.
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?
Here.
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato’s daughter.
No.
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age.
Are you thinking of buying her?
I don’t doubt your wisdom.
Yes, they’re spirits that I’ve called out of their prisons to perform my whims.
You had a Clarence, too, and Richard killed him.
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet’s traditional feast, along with every beautiful woman in Verona.
Why should he call her a whore?
Father, this isn’t easy for me.
Then don’t move while I act out my prayer.
I gave him the material.
Please go.
I don’t know what you and other men think of this life, but as for me, I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself.
Oh!
Certainly, I did.
Oh, the poor bird.
Things have certainly changed!
Hey, are you biting your thumb at us?
There’s a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it.
The words expressly specify “a pound of flesh.” So take your penalty of a pound of flesh, but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it, the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law.
Of course, they won’t believe you without proof.
If she and I are happy, what’s it to you?
He says your daughter’s not feeling well, my lord.
Hail, King of Scotland!
No, not a sad song.
Answer me straightforwardly.
Then you’ll be able to cheer  If he were dead, what would happen to me?
She’s lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
What did he say?
If it pleases you, your highness, will you lead us all inside?
Gentle gods in heaven, please let me die.
What are you thinking?
On Thursday, sir?
Let him come forward.
You do the same, wherever the crowds are thick.
Who said that I was disdainful, and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book?!
My baby hawk?
I swear, somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money.
So will I.
Othello, have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you.
I’ll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing.
Ah, but I know you.
The king is coming here tonight.
I’ll meet all your attacks, even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop.
Oh, really?
Give me comfort.
Come, help me bang on the door, master.
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping.
Now, I swear, I’m so angry that I’m shaking all over.
No.
I cannot speak your England.
I’m serving under him to take advantage of him.
I don’t think so!
No, by Saint Jamy, I’ll bet you a penny!
Look!
The table is full on both sides.
There’s only one hope for you, and even that’s a kind of illegitimate hope.
As far as I know, he’s not even dead.
You’re a bitter fool.
She’s no longer my daughter, and I’ll never see her face again.
My lord!
You certainly deserve it.
He is definitely not there, sir.
To the field!
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men.
God be with you all.
Well, then, that’s how it is.
If my heart’s dear love— Well, don’t swear.
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves.
I can swim like a duck, I swear.
Goodbye, cousin.
Get them in here—Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.
Tell me.
Loss upon loss!
Rest easy in the meantime.
What’s all that shouting about?
How about the mustard without the beef.
I’m my own spokesman.
Take it easy!
I’ve set dangerous plans in motion, using lies, drunken prophecies, and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other.
And at the base of Pompey’s statue, with his cloak covering his face, which was dripping with blood the whole time, great Caesar fell.
Monster, use your fingers.
Give me your hand.
Here he comes back.
You’re in your own kingdom, sir.
My lord, he refuses to come.
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep, “Help, someone!
What’s keeping you?
Yes, return and tell me if your master looks well, because he was sick when he left.
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick, whom she has always appeared to hate.
I will do more, though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime, asking for pardon.
Take good care of him.
I did, my lord.
I’m determined to be heard by someone.
The mayor is here at hand.
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother.
And I’ll be eternally grateful to you.  
With all my heart, I give you that thing which, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try with all my heart to keep from you.
This little prank of hers is going to cost me.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs.
What do you mean, your highness?
I’m here, here!
You resent my friends' rise in society, and my own.
You weren’t good enough for her.
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments?
She’s dead, like a beautiful flower, killed by an unseasonable frost.
Why are you giving me his title?
I hope you’re strong enough to do it.
Four o'clock in the morning.
Aren’t you Kent?
There’s only one body here.
Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil.
If I can believe my eyes, this is a fine sight to see.
Ah, you’re here?—Come on, gentlemen, let’s go!
Show us the way without further delay.—Trinculo, since the king and all our comrades are drowned, we’re the heirs of this place.—Here, carry my wine bottle.—Trinculo, my buddy, we’ll get that bottle refilled soon enough.
What we are is up to us.
Could my good brother-in-law—a man to whom the
Lend me your cloak, Sir Thomas.
It doesn’t matter.
All right, Friar Francis, let’s keep this short.
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake.
Oh, then I guess she was old and gentle, and you rode barelegged, like an Irish yokel.
No one.
How is lieutenant Cassio?
Where is Malvolio?
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command.
Where’s Antonio, then?
Is this true?
Claudio, I’m telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child.
Why would you celebrate it?
Thank you for all your efforts.
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good.
I’m sure Lorenzo isn’t on their ship.
Bad news, my lord.
The sky’s so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out.
Who’s that?
Yeah, and he’s going to tame her.
His insane period is over.
I’ve never seen such a monster.
No matter.
You can refuse to make me your spouse, but I’ll be your servant whether you want me to or not.
All the rest of you can leave too.
I never saw it or suspected it, so it never hurt me.
We’re here to say “amen” to that.
I’ll torture him.
And I saw her do it.
Should we see what he thinks?
So I won’t give or risk anything for lead.
It’s my duty to be quiet.
Your grace, the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready.
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?
I’m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed.
But this whole thing is strange.
Yes, a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world, in fact.
Tranio, I think I’ve got it!
Well, onward, then.
Well, what’s your plan?
Whenever you like.
Tell me, are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet?
He’s lying through his teeth!
Yeah, that would get every single one of us executed.
I have already condemned and excused myself.
What’s going on?
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father.
You said she slept with Cassio.
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman’s clothing.
I’m at your service, madam.
Leave me alone.
Alright, then I’ll see you at Philippi.
If you don’t want to, then good riddance.
Oh God!—Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?
You think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin.
C’mon, I might as well say the fool’s the fool!
I’m not interested in being good.    
Why do you ask?
Gravestones have been known to move, and trees to speak, to bring guilty men to justice.
Please forgive me, master.
They’re playing with me.
I hope to see good days—and many of them.
By all that’s holy, here comes Katherina!
He got there too late.
Is he alone?
You are a rude, ragged nurse and an old, sullen playmate for such tender princes.
Please let me prove you’re a fool.
Then it’s no surprise they had a bad influence on him.
Oh Iago!
Have you killed Tybalt?
And weren’t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends, like Aegles, Ariadne, and Antiopa?
I certainly did, and I never wanted to see you again.
I am a villain.
Stay here at your own risk.
Look in on me, and talk with me, or I’ll attack even without a weapon.
He’s the only worthy man in Italy, aside from my dear Claudio.
Please have a seat.
He’s been gone for nine years and he’s leaving again soon.
Make your boasts come true, and I’ll be thrilled.
I know a terrific wench.
It’s just that my wit is very gentlemanly, Margaret, and refuses to hurt a woman.
Civil wounds now can heal, and peace can live again.
I won’t bet on whether or not any of this is real.
Listen!
Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves.
I admit it doesn’t look that way to me, and the fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart.
Meanwhile, after you.
Spirit, we have to get ready to meet with Caliban.
But since your father doesn’t want him to marry you, you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man.
Yes, I know her age down to the hour.
I am one, my lord.
Why, mistress, my master is as angry as a bull with horns.
I’ll find you another horse.
But I’m as immovable as the northern star, whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky.
Listen, Hortensio.
My servant!
On my honor, I swear I love Rivers with all my heart.
Why are you crying?
Whom do you serve under?
Hey, mistress!
Even if I have to die—as they threaten—I have to help the king.
Good day to you, sir.
Is it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say?
Take up the body.
And when she does, he’ll imagine she’s flirting with him.
Who are you?
That I won’t stand for.
Bring them right in.
Greed has been the downfall of many kings.
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, is that what she says?
Let me finish my curse.
Oh, and I know who loves him.
So, tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated.
You need to.
But here she comes.
I told you, sir, they were totally drunk, so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces, and beating the ground for touching their feet—yet even when drunk, they kept their plan firmly in mind.
I’m leaving now.
Go ask.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, while I with equal affection welcome yours.
What villains did this to you?
Yes, unfortunately.
You haven’t forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you.
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus?
Disgusting!
Pardon, dear father.
He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet.
Let’s draw our own swords too.
Knock, knock!
In my travels, great scholars have come up to me, meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches, and I have seen them tremble and turn pale, and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences, and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they’re so nervous, and then break off abruptly at the end, without actually welcoming me.
We shouldn’t have too big a celebration—we can invite a friend or two.
What?
Tell me.
You mean an officer?
You can relax, ma'am.
If you had any sense of pity, or manners, you wouldn’t pretend to fight over me like this.
If you hang around me for two more years, you’ll forget the sound of your own voice.
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night.
If I don’t do all this, never trust me again.
So let me sleep next to you.
Then I’ll really give it to you.
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men.
What marvelous music!
Let it go.
To, to, to— To murder me?
I can’t remember how I cried then, but I’ll cry all over again.
It’s time for us to stand guard.
What’s that?
Come on, get ready.
Stand further away.
Borachio.
That’s because the murderer is alive.
Absolutely.
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive.
No, Romeo will respond to the letter’s writer, telling him whether he accepts the challenge.
Tomorrow’s a good day.
Not to his father’s house.
But tell me, how is your cousin?
Never, my lord.
Is that true?
I know he holds me dear, but I haven’t asked him about the coronation, and he hasn’t told me.
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched.
As his body grows uglier with age, his mind rots away as well.
Silence, then!
Look, here comes the fool.
Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us.
The privilege of never seeing me again.
Then isn’t it just the right dish for a sweet goose?
We would have liked to have heard your good advice, which has always been serious and helpful, at the council today, but we’ll wait until tomorrow.
BASSANIO Please, Leonardo, think about this  I’ll do my best.
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness.
Are you still set on marrying my brother’s daughter?
Yes, we should get his support, for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions.
I hope you’re not trying to cheat me.
Thank you for saying that, your Worship, but we’re just the poor duke’s officers.
That is the key to long-lasting love.
I’ve told you.
I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords, and that Pyramus isn’t really dead.
Carry your master out.
If it takes all the wine in my bottle, I’ll cure him.
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before.
Excuse me, young man, how do I get to the Jew’s residence?
But you must not attract iron, because my heart is as true as steel.
Don’t worry about me.
Is that possible?
Some to Ligarius’s.
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.
He’ll have to kill both of us, and indeed we’re both men.
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin’s death except me!
They swore that you were sick with love for me.
By this sword” is an oath, and oaths must be kept.
Demand.
But who cares.
You’re not one of Pinch’s patients, are you, sir?
Farewell till then.
Well, I’ll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing.
Well, explain—but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn’t used up by talking about it.
In God’s name, speak.
As long as you move gracefully, look handsome, and say nothing, I’m yours for the dance.
I’m sorry about your daughter’s death, but I swear our accusations were true, and backed up with proof.
And then you’ll see that despite what you thought, I’ll be as powerful as I was before.
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are.
I will go lose myself, wandering up and down throughout the city.
And Trinculo’s drunk.
Follow me, madam.—Throw the blind traitor outside.
Did he marry me just to starve me?
I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away.
When we meet on Judgment Day, that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell, where devils will grab me.
The deal is closed.
I’m telling you, it’s not lost.
Then there’s the Count Palatine.
Come on!
Oh, I really think she loves me!
You didn’t do anything else to earn this punishment?
The games are done and Caesar is returning.
Romeo is coming.
That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports.
Yes, sir, they’re ready.
Oh, Mother Nature, why did you create lions?
The royal tree has left us other fruit, which, with time, will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king, I’m sure.
Take me to the edge of it, and I’ll reward all your troubles with something valuable.
Did you talk with him?
That light is not daylight, I know it.
What do you wish?
Then it’s certain they’re heading for Cyprus.
If her breath steams up the glass, then she’s alive.
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me?
You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have.
I’m glad your father isn’t alive to see this.
The hell with her!
Sirs, never mind.
I won’t stand for it.
Let’s see here.
But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back.
But there is no end, absolutely none, to my sexual desires.
This is exactly how she always looks, and—I swear it—she is fast asleep.
I don’t know, except they are busy with some phony guarantee.
I’ll do anything you ask.
Here I’m kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me, either by thoughts or actions, or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else, or if I never did love him, or don’t love him now—even though he tries to shake me off—
Why does the world report that Kate is lame?
Oh, don’t ask me why I “need” them!
Convince him that he has been out of his mind—and when he says he’s out of his mind  My lord, I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him.
I’ll only admit that you’re sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother’s soul.
It’s all stopped.
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him.
That’s the way to do it!
Please be careful.
Out here everybody can see us.
Tell me.
I do.
Ah, no.
You know, I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown, the one that everyone praises so highly.
And this is all because of our argument.
And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with. 
Come, come, I know what you’re referring to, Richard.
Go to bed, and sleep.
I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced.
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia.
We’re wandering in a maze.
Your words, like your wounds, bring you honor.
I’ll teach you a lesson.
Spread the word.
Your darling?
Let me help you up.
But in loving me, you would love the friend of France, for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it.
It’s just my bad luck.
We’ll see you tomorrow.
But if it’s not double-dealing, sir, I wish you’d deal me another.
Tell us what you know about this affair.
I feel sicker and sicker.
Rest assured that we’re going there to use our hands, not our tongues.
If there’s any way I can spoil his life, I’ll be overjoyed.
Tell me, Fluellen: did you just come from the bridge?
King Lear, I’ve always honored you as king, loved you as my father, obeyed you as my master, and thanked you in my prayers— I’m furious and ready to snap.
Not one drop sooner.
If I ever come back, I’ll bring you good news.
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks.
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar.
I believe it completely.
No, by our Lady, I don’t think he can.
The world is not your friend, and neither is the law.
And I’m expecting his reproach.
It’s wrong, and I’m starting to realize I’m being cheated!
Thank you, brave Cassio.
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly?
You’re a cobbler, are you?
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father.
What?
What do you mean, my lord?
I had to send it to him.
Your humor is a spicy sauce.
Come on, you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you’re in the mood.
Everybody knows I’m a nice piece of flesh.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, just a small circlet—and, as I told you, he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it.
Look over your lines again.
Next time I’ll give you nothing for something.
Come, let’s have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans.
Calm down, Smulkin, you fiend!
When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.
Where is kind Hastings?
But go ahead and charm her, gentle Paris; make her love you.
If I can’t do it myself, I’ll find someone who can.
We three are married, but you two are defeated.
If you meet the Prince in the night, you can order him to stop.
When storms arrive early, you can expect the harvest will be damaged.
But I’m sorry—I’m not allowed to let you visit them.
Taurus!
I’d rather they killed me than have to live without your love.
I hear some noise.
She’s been drowned in salty sea water, and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again.
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men, flattering them into turning Roman law into children’s games.
Your last guess is right.
Because it doesn’t have eight?
As sane as me?
Katherine the shrew!” That’s the worst thing you can call a young woman.
Whatever has already been done can’t be undone now.
The same thing.
Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night.
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back.
When you avoid one trap, you fall into another.
Come, come, hurry up.
She is worse than wicked.
I’m going on alone.
But why do you keep me here so long?
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her.
You must be over there.
One servant cried, “God bless us!” and the other replied, “Amen,” as if they had seen my bloody hands.
Oh, yes, I’m sorry, uncle.—If you’ll excuse me, your grace.
God, that song’s even better than the other one.
The first drink makes him a fool, the second makes him crazy, and the third drowns him.
Here.
Damn you, don’t mock and sneer at me.
Stop!
If our criminal master gets off free, I won’t care what happens to me anymore.
But listen to me; let me guide you.
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye, madam.
Let me be captured.
Help, my lord of Norfolk, help, help!
Sirs, take up the corpse.
Let’s go, we’ll obey you.
He’s safe, Antony.
Men’s eyes were made to see things, so let them watch.
Even though I don’t see it, this lady thinks I’m a marvelously good-looking man.
They tell me he died well, and settled his scores.
So, what’s the news on the Rialto?
He has killed me, Mother.
Haven’t you ever heard the saying, “Two can conspire to put one away”?
Yes, but that makes me love you even more.
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches.
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow.
Quiet there!
I won’t be gone long.
Don’t you have any brothers like you?
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad.
Oh, these men, these men!
Yes, and these.
It doesn’t matter that I hit him first.
Your preparation for war sounds like something.    
Search high and low, in every acre of the fields, and bring him here for me to see him.
I’d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night.
Please go to him, my friend.
Love will give me strength, and strength will help me accomplish this plan.
Arm myself?
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion.
Is Claudio your enemy?
Oh righteous God, how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother’s children and forces her to join others in their grief!
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin.
You brazen whore!
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs.
Now, tailor, let’s see what you’ve got.
Now you sound like a man.
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life.
What’s the problem, that they cry out so loud?
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life.
Sit down, Jessica.
Really, I’m afraid you are.
And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy.
Let’s go to bed, knight.
He’ll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him, that’s for sure.
We’re following you not only because it is our duty, but also because we want to.
Give me your hand.
Hound or spaniel, bitch or dog, Whether your tail is short or curly— Tom will make you cry and wail.
Is that the man you want?
Oh wise judge!
I’m Trinculo—don’t be scared—your good friend Trinculo.
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm, you would’ve told your doorman to let them in, despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world.
Guys who’d take her with all her faults, provided there were enough money involved.
Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that?
Put your straw hats on, have some fun, and dance with these young nymphs.
Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down?
He’s waiting nearby to find out if you’ll invite him in.
So farewell, all, for my tongue has almost finished with its life.
They want to whip me for telling the truth, you want to whip me for lying, and sometimes I’m even whipped for keeping quiet.
We want to hear Caesar’s will.
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn’t been for his love affair with Shore’s wife, I would never have suspected him.
I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking.
Here.
What do you mean?
That’s where I’m going now, so I’ll leave you here.
We have not yet set the coronation day.
I can’t hide what I am.
Come in out of the storm.
Oh, I remember that very clearly!
I’ll come at you with the old proverb: “Should I make myself at home?”  
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead.
Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around!
Quiet there!
How are you, Sir Toby Belch?
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him.
Didn’t he say my brother has run away?
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible.
Why, this was modeled on a porridge bowl!
Do you want to sink?
Benedick’s heart is like a bell, with his tongue as the clapper: everything his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
If you interrupt this monster with one more word, I’ll beat you like a piece of salted fish.
No, no, he’s dead.
Return to the gracious duke, good Catesby.
Have I accomplished so much in battle, but now I’m afraid to tell some old men the truth?
Where is he?
Great God of heaven, say amen to all this!
As freely, son, as God gave her to me.
Indeed, I remember it well.
Here, take the ring.
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous—they all mean the same thing, with some variation.
A love song, a love song.
You’re smiling?
You insolent rascal, what trade?
Where’s Potpan?
Don’t take my love for granted.
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous— where is your mother?
Stanley, Richmond is your wife’s son.
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you.
Please treat my babies well.
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked, which is as bad as being killed by tickling.
What would you like me to do?
Do that.
Here’s another jacket to say thanks.
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results.
Not many, and no one important.
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here.
Leave it alone, you fool.
I’d trust him with everything I own.
If you pay too much attention to him you’ll make him angry, and that will make his convulsions go on longer.
If we don’t obey them, they’ll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue.
As God is my witness, you know you’re mine.
You will be the king.
Isn’t that true?
Don’t be upset.
The other voice is harsh and abusive.
Very serious, and I’m sure it’s because of Beatrice.
I’ll come soon.
Hands, speak for me!
I’ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you, and for no other reason.
Lysander, keep your Hermia.
I’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me.
We have to think about that.
For various reasons that must remain secret, please do this for me.
Indeed, sir, it is.
Is she really that wonderful?
Heaven help us!
I’m not insulting you.
But let’s follow it, and then do our dirty work afterward.
But Roderigo, if you’re as courageous and determined as I think you are, then wait just a bit longer.
Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it.
I don’t feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one.
Is there such a place?
He can’t give his house away to his daughters, leaving himself without shelter.
Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning.
I tell you, you’ve ruined her gown.
You can’t find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you.
You are my love, my love, I think.
Don’t even think about refusing.
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves!
My master is being difficult.
He who chooses me will get what many men want.” What many men want—that “many” could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy.
Ready to set sail, sir?
I’ll stop at every house.
Break it up.” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down.
But you have to.
If she orders me to go, I’ll thank her warmly as if she’d just offered to put me up for a week.
Well, if it wasn’t her, I don’t know.
So it is on earth.
Who’s shouting?
In the mud.
By eight o'clock.
Your words have moved me, and maybe it’ll do some good.
Give me a cup of wine.
Call it a match!
My master will be here in the morning.
And here’s Regan, whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart.
Not of killing him, because I have a warrant for it, but of being damned for killing him, which no warrant can protect me from.
So what if I killed her husband and her father?
That’s some nap.
My lady Olivia’s inside, sir.
Because then I’d have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood.
Oh no, my reasons are deep and as permanent as death.
Which of you does not tremble when you see me?
Ready.
Besides, you’ve gotten unreliable.
Keep an eye on her, Moor.
If your vengeful heart can’t forgive me, here—take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul, which adores you, can be free.
But in the meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking she’s innocent, please.
Signor Brabantio, hey!
I don’t know, sir.
Oh Dardanius!
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work.
Quiet!
Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding.
What does the lead box say?
Let me shake your hand.
I doubt you’d thank me in the end, but she’s rich, all right, very rich.
Be good.
Therefore, love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they’re saying the least, in my opinion.
This letter’s going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot.
Thanks to your majesty.
Take it, brave York.
You must not go without having a drink first.
Why would you do that, my love?
Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and you’re going to go to heaven with him.
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns.
Oh, what a villain!
I’ll be a harsh master to them.
Come on, “nothing” will get you nothing.
Soldier, you must come to the king.
Yes, indeed they are.
Prepare the body, then, and follow us.
We owe you love and service forever.
Your renowned uncle, Duke Menaphon, the famous soldier, brought me here.
This is Lucentio’s house.
So if four negatives make two affirmatives, I’m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes.
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her, it’s true.
Your true demonic features are distorting your body.
Sad, my lady!
What’s wrong with my niece?
Marry her as you should have married her cousin, and I will let my revenge die.
Little pitchers have big ears.
My God, I’m the highest-ranking person who speaks this language—if only we were back where it’s spoken.
Cheer up as much as you can.
If I could beg others to change their minds, begging would convince me, too.
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty.
You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it.
As I sat on the shore crying over my father’s shipwreck, I heard the music creep over the wild waves, calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies.
Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, for a whole hour now.
I don’t think there’s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government.
But what’s your trade?
It’d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything.
Yes, sir.
Poor Tom will take you there.
Command this man to leave.
This play isn’t right for you.
I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys.
Please, just look over there.
I assure you, sir, it’s true.
As I came down?
That’s why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully.
It’s our destiny, like death.
I told him we’ll stay for at least a month, and he says that he hopes we’ll stay longer.
Good question, my girl.
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea, leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire.
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn.
He’s conducting some business with my lady, and sooner or later he’ll leave.
Signior Balthasar, you look upset.
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction, see, of my mind, with respect to the demands of proper military practice—that’s the point?
Oh, sirs, if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I would offend Brutus and Cassius, who, you all know, are honorable men.
Oh, I’ll beat him up for that!
What’s this noise?
Do you bring me a letter from the friar?
You’re like the poor cat in the old story.
It came from a neutral party, not from someone opposed to you.
Strangle her in her bed, the same bed she’s contaminated.
Leap and dance for him.
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex?
Then, hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it.
At least two hours past.
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile.
What can you see out on the ocean?
Portia, goodbye to you.
You were never with me for anything if you weren’t there for the goose.
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice, and left him there in a trance.
I beg your pardon, sirs.—Please tell me your name, sir?
Please, just wait a minute.
Check on your daughter, your house, your money!
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil.
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning.
Did you accompany Caesar home?
I think it’s better to call it off.
Oh, I’ll rest here forever.
Your son Edward, who stabbed my son Edward, is dead.
Good morning to all these lovely people.
Damn it, shut your mouth.
That’s why I praise myself, who—if I do say so myself—is quite praiseworthy.
But how is it possible that Prospero’s alive and well and living on this island?  
Am I Dromio?
I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again.
What further pain must I endure in my old age?
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly?
I’ll follow after you.
What’s all the noise in here?
Watch out, boy—remember I can whip you.
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him!
Don’t worry, sir.
Are you the lady of the house?
So, the sun won’t shine today!
But now I see our weapons are like straws, our strength like a straw’s weakness, and our weakness past comparison, so that we seem to be the thing we most are not.
Unhappy fortune!
Let my sorrow have the upper hand.
Thieves!
It’s too late.
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master.
Think like that, and you’ll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself.
Isn’t that him on the ground?
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock.
And here’s my mistress, Titania.
No, my lord, I didn’t see anything.
What horrible thing are you imagining?
But not so nice when women misbehave.
You don’t know me, but I know you’re an important person.
Then I’ll smack you on the head with the serving-creature’s knife.
I told him that your father was in Venice, and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today.
That’s what we’re trying to say, sir.
Apologize?
What’s the boy Malcolm?
But I, who have never known how to beg and never had to beg, am starved for food, dizzy with lack of sleep, kept awake with curses and fed with brawling.
Here it is, I think.
Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
I’ve had enough of this “off with you!” Come on, let me in!
He’s my prisoner and you can’t have him.
But she, your subject, hates such a king.
Please, father, I beg you.
They shout for joy.
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart?
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel.
Oh, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground.
It wasn’t the journey itself, uncle, but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull.
Pardon my crime, sovereign, but not my person.
shifts, friends, to Southampton.
If he looks serious, he must need money.
I heard someone say that’s what it means.
What do you think?
She’s sending this ring back to you, sir.
We haven’t been able to meet on a hill or in a valley, in the forest or a meadow, by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream, or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us.
Fine, but not enough.
Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight.
But she is no virgin.
But who would dare tell her?
Never trust me again if I don’t.
So have a seat and talk to her.
Do you have it with you?
Ah, there’s the problem.
Who do you want to work for?
All of them?
Madam, I will.
If that’s what you say, go fight a duel with me and prove it.
Perhaps a woman’s voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up.
Don’t be late.
That was a poor unlucky beggar.
I think he really is angry.
It was two o'clock when I left him, and now it’s one.
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors.
Hold on, then.
And you say he’s not jealous?
You don’t have to go yet.
I’ll leave him alone.
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once, when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear.
No sir, trust me, I do not.
All right, I’ll stay another month.
No.
Be happy about it.
You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
Where’s Romeo?
I don’t dare, sir.
Bless your five senses!
Good old knight, gather them all together at my tent.
But come on, start.
Is it young Romeo?
I’ll be nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him.
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about.
And tell her, listen to me, on Wednesday—Wait—What day is today?
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him.
You saw my master wink and laugh at you?
I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love.
Yoo-hoo!
Here’s the head of that notorious traitor, the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
Where’s the king?
It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.
An old Italian fox is never that generous, my boy.
Go take care of him.
Nearest his heart.”—Those are the very words.
If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!
Be quiet.
Now, Catesby, what does your lord say to my request?
Keep myself?
I’d give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him.
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome.
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum.
Seriously, though, son Petruchio, I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all.
Gloucester, it’s true that we are in great danger.
I’ll get free of you.
I know, prince.
I’ll have no halves.
But go on.
More than anything else in the world, I love you, value you, and honor you.
Our friends are all waiting for you.
Do you even know what you’re talking about?
How are you and your master getting along?
Your sister’s sister.
The duke went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
Then stay with us.
I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
Once there, make your thoughts work harder, and witness a siege.
My God, she can’t be a Jew, she’s too nice!
Now you have only the memory of what you were, which tortures you when you consider what you’ve become.
No, Cassius, no.
You will, my lord.
How short am I?
Your sister’s the better soldier of the two.
But I’m wishing for something I already have.
A devil like you could lead me to hell.
What’s this?
It’s cheap and nasty!
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while.
What, all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop?
It was a rough night.
The devil in him is strong!
Richard Earl of Cambridge, I arrest you for high treason.
Here comes better news.
Did he lose his other eye?
You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar!
Excuse me, sir, do you know anything about this?
and affection, even if it’s just an act.
On this hill and in despair, with his slave Pindarus.
Can she give that away too?
If you still love her after that, then marry her tomorrow.
You have wonderful armor, but give my horse his due.
What do you say?
I’m not.
Let them start something.
It is.
I will, lady.
It’s hell in our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil.
I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly.
Fire!
Yes, ma'am.
Sir, he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it.
But it’s enough to know that the day will end, and then the end will be known.
Go inside yourself.
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast.
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running.
What do you want, fellow?
No, not until we see a hot January.
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die.
What didn’t you like?
Relax, gentlemen.
Leave him to my wrath.—Edmund, go with my sister-in-law.
So you’re admitting Clarence, my father, is dead.
Amen.
Yes,” said my husband, “Did you fall on your face?
Hail, king!
One of you go call the Jew into court here.
Now I want her more than ever.
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel, and good luck to him then.
But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself.
Here.
He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters.
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell.
If it’s for me, don’t keep it from me.
On me, though I am barely half the man that Edward was?
I swear, it must be thirty years.
Excellent, good.
What heir of the York family is there alive other than myself?
Is it daytime?
A loud-mouthed, drunken monster.
It 
Oh, you excellent young man!
I’ll go to the right side.
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose.
Are you trying to start a fight?
You have guessed exactly what I feared.
I can’t make myself a man by wishing I were, so as a woman I’ll die, from grieving.
Even though everything evil wants to look good, good still has to look good too.
Give him room.
Oh, I’m sick, sick!
I don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words.
I can’t help remembering the things that were most precious to me.
What?
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep.
Why, she was dead before you were even born.
Come on in, tailor.
From my kind uncle, who I know will give it to me, especially as it’s not worth much.
What can I tell you?
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland—always an unreliable neighbor.
A lively young one!
Around three or four o'clock, look for news from the meeting hall.
A woman should always pick an older man.
Tell me that.
You don’t have to worry about any of these lords, my lady.
Wicked woman, these white hairs you’re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing.
Do you like pictures?
Very well taken, I believe, very wise.
How did you divide yourself in two?
Oh, I’m talking too loud.—Where’s Malvolio?
Not if you want to keep your arms!
Tonight she is shut up in her room, alone with her sadness.
I can’t believe it.
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him.
I’m glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you.
Hail!
Sirs, I ask you to sleep in my tent.
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman.
My name’s Roderigo.
That’s what I conceive of him.
Your wit is so forceful, it frightens the very meaning out of your words.
Didn’t you call him a liar?
She was tricked, divorced, wronged, spited, killed!
Beat the drum.
Probably because my cheeks' roses needed rain, which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes.
I’ll tell you this, Constable, my mistress has his own hair.
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello.—You whorehouse-keeper.
My words are dull.
Yes, making a big fuss.
I’m afraid he will.
The first time we see the world as newborns, we cry and scream.
Why are you telling me this?
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world.
As you wish, sir.
Very good, sir.
But even so, we can’t do without him.
Yes,” said my uncle Gloucester, “Small plants are graceful, while ugly weeds grow fast.” And since then, I’ve wished I wouldn’t grow so fast, because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry.
My husband!
That is, if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca’s love.
I’ll leave you for now.
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
Next thing you know, he’ll be saying “widower Aeneas.” “Widow Dido,” did you say?
I don’t know any fancy ways of talking about love, only to say right out, “I love you.” If you press me any further than with the question, “Do you really?” my love scene is over.
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions.
We’ve seen the best our age has to offer.
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable?
It would be better if they were all on his father’s side, or that there were none at all on his father’s side.
And that’s everything, Leonato.—Claudio, Benedick—my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina.
They only feel the shadow of joy.
Good night.
Here, drink to me.
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me.
No, I’d rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men.
He’s going after a young widow.
I can’t, ma'am.
But why couldn’t I say “Amen”?
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower.
Oh, then I see you’ve been with  Who’s Queen Mab?
Thank you, sir.
Don’t kneel, noble Portia.  
I’ll say goodbye once more.
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own.
But if you remember, I didn’t tell you to parody the style.
Here.
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster.
Take me by the hand and say, “Harry of England, I am yours.” No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out, “England is yours, Ireland is yours, France is yours, and Harry Plantagenet
Or at least that’s what I plan to do before I let you go.
Peter!
It starts, “Shut up.” I’ll never be able to start if I shut up.
Your case is most unusual, though the Venetian law can’t stop you from proceeding.— Yes, so he says.
Well then, the beef without the mustard.
And you, sir, had me arrested over that necklace.
I hope God makes you happy again, like you once were.
I like singing.
Go!
My dream told me that dreamers often lie.
Tonight is for celebrating!
Madam, with all my heart.
Instead, lend it to me as your enemy.
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.
We’re lucky that Rome is rid of him.
I’ll write down what she says, so I’ll remember it better.
That’s the truth.
Go ahead and write it down.
What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity.
But are they all safe, Ariel?
So he’s dead?
No, lieutenant—God, gentlemen—Help—Lieutenant—sir, Montano—Help, men!—The night guard is coming!
Is everything ready for that event?
Shake my hand.
I saw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind.
More shouting!
Hold your peace.
You know too much about suffering.
Don’t be sad that this happened because of you, because Lady Luck’s been nicer to me than usual.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
I flashed about faster than lightning.
Can’t help it?
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over.
Your Clarence, who stabbed my Edward, is also dead.
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency, and even pretended he didn’t know him.
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit, but who cares?
I’ll do what I can to make you even more comfortable.
One last thing, and this is up to you.
God forbid!
Yes, with the sign underneath him that says: “Here lives Benedick the married man”?
Musicians, play us a song.—Prince, you look sad.
That might be the case sir, 
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone.
Hortensio and I have given you up.
What does this say?
them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
From now until then seems like twenty years.
You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio.
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves”!
Yes, and she was mild too.
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces?
Their hounds are unequaled in courage.
Come on, let’s go to prison.
Well, then he must be alive.
Where are these murderers?
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about?
My daughter told me everything.
The moon?
See how he stands between two clergymen!
I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man.
Hurry, hurry!
Bow to him, fairies, and curtsy to him.
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness.
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too.
Is the army without a leader?
Death is my heir.
How tragic!
Reborn.
Likewise, I’m young, and my sense of reason has just ripened.
And I’d be surprised if he even did that, for he prefers sports, fun, and friends.
No, cousin, I’m crying.
Most sweet lady— Oh, “sweet”!
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, on pressing state business.
I am bound by oath, so please forgive me.
I curse myself for doing that!
No, don’t hit him, lieutenant!
Will it be tonight at supper?
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt.
People say he’s generous, well educated, and brave, and he’s very attractive.
No, the man who cannot extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever.
How can a tailor make a person?
That’s not how I do business.
Yes, a little too sweet.
How did you learn about this?
The duke will agree with me on that.
Yes, and I’ll give it to him for free.
Now, Titania, wake up, my sweet queen.
My own flesh and blood turned against me!
Will they see us?
His letter’s going to be hilarious.
You would take it back?
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads.
Just as I did with the meat, I’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made, and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other, and the blanket over here and the sheets over there.
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said, but to say what  I think there’s a lot of sense in what he says.
You’re going to die.
You and I cannot be held within the confines of a country’s arbitrary customs, dear Kate.
Welcome, traveler.
I don’t know what to think about this.
What?
Well, I’ll commit the sin of double-dealing, and deal you a second coin.
Is this the king we offered to ransom?
Will it never be morning?
Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back.
Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers.
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king.
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders.
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are!
I’m sure I can answer for him—he doesn’t know any, either.
How exactly have I offended you?
I have no choice.
Even for a  Good morning, lieutenant.
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries.
Here.
You liar, you’re turning my heart to stone, and making me call what I’ll do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice!
But I have to remember that I’m here on Earth, where doing evil is often praised, and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake.
The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly.
Farewell.
I don’t until you practice them on me.
But goodbye.
My father can’t think straight—a hundred knights!
And didn’t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you?
Petruchio?
I’ll tell him right away, my lord.
I think few die well who die in battle.
You’ll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that  Well, you’re wrong, my Lord High Constable.
I humbly thank you, sir.
How am I unfaithful?
Why do you say that?
I’m a prince by birth, Miranda—maybe even a king now; though I wish I weren’t—and normally I wouldn’t put up with carrying these logs any more than I’d let flies breed in my mouth.
Tell her to come to me.
I know that he’ll be on our side.
Why?
I pity England, but not myself.
He’s insane.
We want to hear it, Antony.
Listen!
You have forgotten, and you think it’s a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean, or run on the north wind, or do business for me underground when the earth’s frozen solid.
Then God be praised, it  Petruchio, do whatever you like.
Bassanio, the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone.
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves.
Here I go.
Unless my horse goes faster than expected, I will be back an hour or two after sunset.
Come with me.
And don’t be suspicious of me, noble Brutus.
This is the day I’m going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me.
Forgive me, your grace.
Wait, madam.
Now I must go to the tomb alone.
I’ll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here.
Where have you been, boy?
Why not?
Why do you look like a frightened goose?
Don’t say no.
I swear to you— You have a good heart, and believe me, I’ll tell her that.
Did I do anything good to myself?
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done.
And go away, witch, go away.
Have a nice day!
Well, Brutus, you’re noble.
A sword’s too heavy for you to wear.
It’s Cinna.
The more she
March to meet him at a dignified pace.
I’ll give you cramps for saying that—horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing.
It’s so simple!
What?
Indeed you did, and more besides, Miranda.
Watch her.
I’m a soldier, more experienced than you, and better able to give orders.
Are you going to let us in?
I’m whipped and tortured— May God give you a good evening.
If there’s enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight, I won’t spend tonight in this town.
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges: she doesn’t want to add perjury to her list of sins.
Dromio, you drone, you snail, you slug, you idiot!
Husband?
It’s not friendly, and it’s not ladylike.
I’ll die like a swan.
Tell me what you did with the king’s ship, the sailors, and the other ships.
Oh, mighty Caesar!
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth.
Get that fool out of here.
It won’t matter.
But please tell me, sir, is your marriage  Let him do his worst.
Show me, show me.
But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.
You knew my father well; therefore, you know me, the sole heir to all his property and possessions, which I have added to rather than depleted.
Oh, sweet mermaid, don’t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister’s tears.
He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb.
You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my daughter’s plans to run away.
Or had a friend who would be a man for me!
The wide ocean doesn’t prevent them from coming to see her—they travel across it as if it were a little stream.
That too.
The best news of all is that we’ve located our king and our men.
Fool!
No?
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard.
Let him mount the pulpit.
And you, sweet Hero?
Now I say good night to your bones, Hero.
Come on, what did Romeo say?
In that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer.
That’s “Ninus’s grave,” man.
Ambition shouldn’t be so soft.
Are you sick?
Now I’ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence’s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward’s sons.
What, have you forgotten me?
Your Majesty shall mock at me.
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible.
My mind is too great for that.
But don’t keep wondering without more proof.
Is your other mouth calling my name?
I’ll follow you and turn this hell I’m in into a kind of heaven.
My daughter married death.
Brutus, do not provoke me.
To leave his wife, his children, his house, and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it!
Are you an actor?
I’m glad to see you.
You’re stripped of your power and your command, and Cassio will govern Cyprus.
Haven’t you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger?
Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever?
Take up the sword again, or take me up.
He couldn’t be a lion if the Romans weren’t such easy prey.
Chat her up, Sir Andrew.
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world?
Is my ink and paper ready?
Do you love me?
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that?
Enough, cousin.
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath, where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city.
That’s good advice.
There’d be no marriage?
Goodbye.
I’m amazed how similar you and your daughters are.
Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another, still… I know what I know.
I hear his trumpet.
She is our principal demand—one of the first points of the treaty.
I will, my lord.
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war.
They’ll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
There’d be no work.
Oh wicked wall, through which I don’t see any happiness!
Shall we not?
By the god Jupiter above, I swear “No.” By Jupiter’s wife Juno, I swear “Yes.” They wouldn’t dare.
What’s the matter, dear?
You bastard!
No, stop.
Yes, we talked for a couple of hours.
Go announce that he will be executed, and tell Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles will be given to him.
It’s too hot.
If you were as young as I am, if you were in love with Juliet, if you had just married her an hour ago, if then you murdered Tybalt, if you were lovesick like me, and if you were banished, then you might talk about it.
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming.
I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position.
I give you my obedience and my humble service, madam.
Call the Duke of Burgundy.
We’re on a tight schedule.
Do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here?
Where are you going?
What’s the matter?
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child.
Just go after him and watch what he does next.
I don’t think it’s a good idea.
I know you’re the right person for this job.
Look how far that little candle sends its light!
And so I’m dying.
Is it that early in the day?
Why not?
Then heaven have mercy on me!
And I beg you, please come here again tomorrow.
Go on.
Indeed, my lord, he is a perfectly wonderful horse.
So I’d like it copied.
Oh, my lady, I’m ashamed to admit it.
How are you doing?
Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies?
Here they come.
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels.
He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide.
Oh, in the duke of Gloucester’s wallet.
Now everyone be seated, as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat.
Bring him to me in silence.
Son, I’ll stake you half that Bianca comes.
And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently?
And what a beard trimmed like the general’s or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale, you wouldn’t believe.
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want to hear.
It’s not quite that simple.
If he’d written nice things, I’d swear yes right away.
Her eyes are saying something.
Look, look!
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter?
Lord, what fools these mortals are!
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too.
If you refuse me, the laws of Venice have no validity.
Should I say to you, “Set them free!
And death, not Romeo, can take my virginity!
For shame!
Give me your arm.
I had to hurry to my love, beautiful Helena, who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars.
Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore.
A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty.
I know I’m not fooling myself, or letting myself get carried away by my imagination, because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me.
The court has sent for us.
They want to talk.
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm, they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him, lobby for him, or support him in any way.
Cassio’s killed a young Venetian named Roderigo.
Come, father, I’ll leave you at a friend’s house.
I swear to you, I don’t want to be doing this.
Your highness will have to force me to tell.
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter.
Is this really happening?
Time has come round, and I’ll end where I began.
What good luck!
You’re cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust.
The king is insane.
Divine, perfect woman, give me a chance to prove in detail that I’m innocent of the evils you accuse me of.
Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.
If you remember your life before you came here, you may also remember how you got here.
She’s always talking when I want to sleep.
If she wants to be proud, or “honest,” as she calls it, she can just marry her own pride.
That’s a step in the direction of love.
Please go on.
I mean, is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful?
Honestly, I didn’t see it, but I felt it in her hot breath.
If you want to make me happy, don’t wish yourself harm.
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace.
There’s more to this ring than its cash value.
you will  And what if he won’t stop?
When they see the face of Caesar, they will vanish.
Now heaven has her.
Oh you damned villain!
What did he do that made him flee this land?
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague.
Play, I say!
What dangers are you trying to lead me into, Cassius, that you want me to look inside myself for something that’s not there?
I’ll talk with this good man.
Who do you obey here?
Margaret, run into the sitting room.
The Tower’s chaplain has buried them, but to tell you the truth, I don’t know where.
But don’t you see what a    Did you hear someone?
What name, madam?
I’ve been hurt.
Until you get back, Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows.
She will  A pimp!
I think you’re my mirror, not my brother.
Thanks, good Egeus.
Whom you swore you would protect and defend.
Yes, leeks are good.
Who’s Thisbe?
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns.
Yes, he said something in Greek.
Well, time will tell.
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again.
But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men.
You will not blame us in your funeral speech, but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission.
One of us will stay and stand guard.
I can hear the lark singing.
The day will come when you’ll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous, hunchbacked toad.
I’m very afraid of Banquo.
I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more rational than this.
I didn’t call you.
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you, fire up your passions, and make you angry and jealous.
It’s after six o'clock, my lord, when you said our work would be finished.
Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar, who berated him for speaking well of Pompey.
I’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me.
I’ll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour.
It’s better here than outside.
Go, blockheads, go, and bring my supper to me.  
We’ll be there, and there we’ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully, truly obscenely.
Oh, shut up!
My lord, most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard.
Is it time, my Lord Constable?
Calphurnia!
Didn’t they ever whisper?
What do you want?
What, are you crazy?
I know you.
We’ve been waiting a long time for this day.
Smile, then, on this beautiful union.
I told you, someone’s at the gate.
I’m still a virgin.
Unnatural acts will cause  Good night, good doctor.
Okay, I’m ready.
Find him and tell him to come here.
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor, I am the most guilty soul alive.
You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee.
We’re trying to be reasonable while you’re so upset, and we understand that you’re old, and… But Goneril knows what she’s doing.
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair.
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.
The ground feels flat to me.
But oh, how odd it is to have to ask for my child’s forgiveness!
If we can do that, everything will be all right.
With all my heart, I’ll go right away.
Brother— Quiet.
Have you both really given me up?
Give me one good reason to think she’s cheating on me.
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style.
Well, well, I don’t care.
Oh, spite of spites!
So she was moved by it?
Oh, my, it’s my husband.
It’s good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin.
Therefore, great king, we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy.
Yes, do that.
I’m not myself.
Your fate awaits you.
That’s it.
I’m finished.
When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air.
Where’s your master, Dromio?
ate at home, but the jeweler says he didn’t.
My strength is all gone, as if in a dream.
Thank you.
I’ll hound him.
Please make him change his mind.
After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else.
I’m sure it is to knight you, Captain.
Shylock, are you listening?
I swear to God, madam, you’ve wronged me, and I’ll tell the whole world.
He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff.
One weakness led to another, to make me hate myself.
I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise.
If you send them word that you won’t come, they might change their minds.
Darn it, if I’d guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman, I never would have challenged him.
Oh God, whose side I think I’m fighting on, look kindly on my forces.
Along the way, I’ll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen’s proud relatives, as step one in the plan we’ve discussed.
Admit you were wrong.
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry?
Lord, how painful it was to drown.
Calphurnia, my wife, is keeping me at home.
It’s not for me to say.
Go back to bed.
Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your complaints, and I’ll listen.
Thank you, my noble lord.
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home, they cannot escape God.
You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies.
Everything’s ready.
With God as my witness, I swear I have wept for yours.
Alright, here’s the vial.
Give me my money and let me go.
He must do this, or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered.
Let’s carry him in triumph to his house!
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I’ve shown how inappropriately he’s behaved— Here, ma'am.
Just let me follow behind you, even though I’m not good enough for you.
I’d tell them that I saw natives like these—since they must be natives—who are graceful and well-mannered even if they’re monstrous to look at, kinder than most human beings you might find— kinder than almost any human.  
They shouted three times.
If he agrees, great.
Get up and listen to me.
Claudio deserves to be honored, and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly.
I’ve only given the articles a cursory glance.
What, just because they kissed in private?
This is the Dauphin’s message.
Not now, my sweet Desdemona.
There’s still the King of France’s farewell ceremony.
We hope you feel better and find some peace.
Go get money.
Oh, be quiet.
Doors, open up for whoever is knocking!
Why are you looking at me so strangely?
Wait a minute, Jew.
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry.
Well go on home.
The more I try to hide what I’m feeling, the bigger it gets.
Banquo, if your soul is going to make it to heaven, tonight’s the night.
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the  You’re being arrested?
You tie up horses by their heads, dogs and bears by their necks, monkeys by their waists, and humans by their legs.
Did you speak to him?
My poor husband, my dear Edward!
Have you seen him today?
I order you to stop!
And when you get married, I hope I can be married at the same time.
Before your sentence has been completed?
Indeed, we have many good days to look forward to!
Be patient, madam.
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic.
My head is pounding.
Now you know the reason for the rush.
Goodbye.
You wouldn’t know enough to be afraid of traps.
No.
No, girl!
Leave me for a bit.
Take care of the lady.
I have a good reason to cry, but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry.—Oh, Fool, I’ll go mad!
Wait good Nurse.
True, he has an excellent reputation.
I speak to you as a plain soldier.
Well, your imprisonment won’t last long.
When you have said your lines, go hide in that bush.—Everyone else, go there too when you’re not onstage.
Did we, my lord?
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before, and it’s not natural either.
Watch me like a hawk.
Gentle boy, good night.
And because you interrupt us so that we can’t dance for them, the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood, just to get revenge on you.
I see you don’t intend to part with her—or perhaps you don’t like my company.
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.” So get out of here, disloyal thanes, and join the weak and decadent English!
I cannot drink too much of Brutus’s love.
There’s no darkness except ignorance, and you’re more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog.
Do you work in this house?
Leave, you little man.
My spells are working well, my spirits are obeying me, and everything is right on schedule.
The rules of dueling say he has to.
I definitely will.
If he’s caught, he’ll never make trouble for anyone again.
My lord?
I never thought any less of him.
It’s Richard who sent us here to slaughter you.
Which one of them did it?
If we take away Caesar’s support, he’ll have to come back down to earth; otherwise, he’ll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience.
Don’t believe in this.
That’s three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn’t come back.
But has Catesby gone?
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature.
Damn your mistress!
Investigate how this foul murder came about.
I, who have heard the rumble of guns in battle—and thunder in the sky (heaven’s version of artillery).
Oh, she’s a fine woman!
You have the power to fix it.
I’m going to England.
What else?
Tell me one.
Age hasn’t dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much, and luck hasn’t robbed me of so much of my fortune, and my bad ways haven’t deprived me of so many friends, that they won’t find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally, with money and friends at my disposal.
Goodbye, my Desdemona.
But as it stands, I wish I could believe it wasn’t.
Brutus, may I have a word with you?   
You’re a funny man, sir.
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles.
What do you mean, do I think so?
I’ve only made it this far since I left her place, walking at a moderate pace.
Oh, no.
All right.
How can that be?
I am nothing but a poor, used fool.
I’m surprised my bland husband didn’t meet me on the way here.
Listen, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
I believe drink did all of this to you last night.
We won’t take their garbage.
God protect you from them and from other false friends!
By Jesus, I am your Majesty’s countryman, and I don’t care who knows it.
I did.
Good sir—
Got it?
Ariel, you’ve done your work exactly as I ordered.
Enough, gentlemen.
If you take it too seriously, it’ll have bad effects that I didn’t want it to have.
Are you all good and honest men?
You’re up early.
Hello, sir.
Let me choose now.
I’m sorry you don’t have time.—Antonio, give this gentleman a reward.
Iago, I’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you.
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind.
Here’s Romeo’s man.
Brother, I’m giving you good advice.
I will not be faced or bested.
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar.
Well, I think that even if it weren’t on record, the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next—all the way to Doomsday.
At my humble house tonight, you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below.
If you care about your health, you won’t push me any further.
I don’t care what he told you in Latin.
Attack the breach in the city wall once more, dear friends, attack it once more—or else let’s close it up with English corpses.
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers.
It’s amazing, if I may say so, that she let herself be tamed.
His youngest daughter, the beautiful Bianca, is the jewel of my life, and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand.
And then throw the seeds in the sea, to make more islands grow.
I’ll meet you there.
Heaven knows what he’s going to do with it.
Yes, but I know— What do you know?
And he deserves it, having been excellent before he had a reputation for it.
But I won’t attack a woman, even if she is a demon.
Oh, wine is the devil!
Look, Don Pedro has come back for you.
Have some others search.
Let me live here forever.
Let fortune and victory be yours!
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves.
However, this is an extreme situation, and it’s more important to control it than to worry about how you’ll look.
It was windy on shore too.
A woman more beautiful than the one I love?
Here.
We’re strangers here.
But if I am myself, then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife.
The heart won’t be reasoned with.
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona, which you asked me to steal so many times.
They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands.
We’re not invading England out of ambition or greed, but out of love—dear love!—and my father’s right to his kingdom.
I’m out of breath, sir.
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that—not to follow their bad example, but to avoid it!
Where does he sleep?
Order them to move back.
Lorenzo will be happy with what we’ve done.
No, he didn’t get any by me.
So far I’ve done exactly what I was supposed to do—I put the love potion on an Athenian’s eyes.
My king says this: “Tell Harry of England: though we appeared dead, we were only asleep.
Good-bye, until you return tonight.
Oh, Caesar, read mine first, for my petition affects you more directly.
Meanwhile, I’ll get Sir Toby.
The women you rape are the ones who’ll have to “sense” it.
I’m locked up in a prison and deprived of food.
I think we’ll have to leave out all the killing, come to think of it.
It’s no time for jokes: sober up.
I’m sure he’s out there dancing.
There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears.
My noble king, my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother, the haughty Bishop of Exeter, are now in  My king, the Guildfords in  My lord, the duke of Buckingham’s army— Enough, you 
And on their graves, I trust, the story of this day’s work will be written in brass.
I myself, who am more indebted to you than anyone, have brought you this young scholar 
Send the deed after me and I’ll sign it.
All hail, Macbeth!
But, uncle, you know how to bear with him.
Alright, I will.
Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case.
Ding, dong, bell.
It’s your music, madam, from your house.
But the enemy is loud.
Understand?
That you love my daughter to spite your soul.
Tybalt was my nephew!
Shame on you!
I couldn’t see you, Lysander, but I heard your voice, and that’s how I found you.
I’m glad you’ve come, father.
Oh, she’s so witty and creative!
Let’s go at it, coward!
Yes, yes.
Look!
I’d be ashamed to give you this.
She is dead.
But listen to me, Gratiano.
Why “puppet”?—Oh, I see where this is going.
Watch his reaction.
Can’t do it.
She’s the reason I’m here.
Don’t tell me that.
The king rode out alone to view their troops.
Have courage, man.
An annoying schoolboy, unworthy of such an honor, joined by a masquerader and a partier!
The forests, the skies, the mountains, everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds.
His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir.
Good sir, calm down.
For the sake of our old friendship, I ask you, hold my sword handle while I run on it.
Don’t let that lawyer ever come near my house!
Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts.
As long as heaven and nature extend it.
Why, wouldn’t you?
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago.
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place.
And look, here’s Publius, come to fetch me.
Who are you?
In the meantime, think about how I can do you good and give you what you want.
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon.
Let me go with you to Belmont.
Would you walk out with me, sir?—Oh, Desdemona— Yes, my lord?
My good lord, I still need you to like me.
My new master is expecting your approach.
You have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use none of your talent for the right purpose—not your body, not your love, not your mind.
Yes, indeed, and all the King’s men, the Duke of Milan and his fine son too.
What do you want me to do with this?
Why not stay and hear me talk to him?
Imagine, when we talk of horses, that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth.
Give me the necklace!
Dear gods, bless this couple, since you’re the ones who have shown us the path that led us here.
Or in the power of reason.
You’ll see.
Oh, she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means.
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert.
Why are you waiting?
It’s called the evil.
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven’t done anything wrong?
Take credit, God, for it is no one’s doing but yours.
Cheer up.
Say welcome to all of our friends for me, sir, for in my heart they are all welcome.
Oh, I’ve read that.
Where did we leave off?
Think about it.
In this day and age, if a man doesn’t erect his own monument before he dies, he won’t be remembered past the funeral bell’s ringing and his widow’s crying.
I’m everywhere.
Now, most noble Brutus, the gods are friendly with us today so that we, who want peace, can live on to old age!
No, it’s permanent.
God alive!
A horse, a horse, I’d give my kingdom for a horse!
Noses, ears, lips.
Now, you lie there on the path.
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean. 
As I neglected practical matters, being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine, I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother.
I sent the French queen with him too, for the same reason.
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress.
Who are these men?
True, noble prince.
Where are you going?
I will not rise until your Highness hears me.
Why the nobles were imprisoned, and on what charges, I don’t know, my gracious lord.
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him, or that the church is supported by your drum because it “stands by” your drum.
I swear by this hand that I love you.
And so, good Capulet—which is a name I love like my own name—you should be satisfied with what I say.
What can I give you that you want, my lord, except the one thing you can’t have?
I’ll expect you.
I tell you truly, in true English: I love you, Kate.
I’ll show you where to get fresh water.
As long as it’s honorable, you can be sure that I’ll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you.
I’ll debate this with you later, and then I’ll teach you to listen more carefully.
Oh, let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to 
Believe me, I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins.
O noble English, who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces, leaving the other half to stand by, idle and laughing.
Fine.
Stay down, heart.
May a plague strike both your families!
Even if we don’t fight foreign enemies, we’ll beat down these rebels at home.
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool, paint your face with blood, and make a fool out of you.
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid.
Go now, Lord Constable and all you princes, and quickly bring us news of England’s defeat.
But I’m not dying yet!
He’s not a “master,” sir, he’s just a poor man’s son.
Then if he dies, his death serves him.
It’s still warm from the cut.
My dear, let’s go inside and wait for them to arrive.
To get used to the life you’ll most likely be leading soon, get rid of your low-class trappings.
Don’t make me do it, my lady.
Who else should it be?
Now get out of here!
What’s this!
What do you want with me?
It’s as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea, and it can swallow as much as the sea can.
You should be whipping yourself, since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you’re punishing her.
How?
In a way” is the right way to go.
Open it and read it.
Yes, he did.
You don’t really love me.
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him!
Take this, too.
You’re right, actually.
Leave me alone for a minute.
Give it to me!
Dido was from Carthage, not Tunis.
You absolute villain!
She always has to have a light next to her.
Passionate”?
Is that enough of an answer?
If it pleases your Majesty, let his neck pay the price, if there is any martial law in the world.
Come, blade, drench my breast with blood.
Oh God, Iago, what can I do to win my husband back again?
I think so too.
No, by Our Lady, I’m not such a fool to think what I please, and I don’t please to think what I can, and in fact I cannot think, even if I could think my heart right past thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love.
Oh, lying woman!
Stanley, what news do you have?
Think about it.
He will die.
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind, and when they fall, they shatter into pieces.
Dear general, I never gave you any reason to hate me.
It’s true I heard a humming sound, a strange one, which woke me up.
Bring him with us.
My doors were locked and I was shut out, right?
Please stand up!
A gentleman?
Don’t be afraid of her company.
Who measured the ground?
Good countrymen, let me leave alone.
Hello, good sir.
Tsk, you’re wrong.
Who are you talking about, niece?
Good lady, don’t be angry with the child.
But I didn’t want to be free like this.
Wait, here’s a penny to heal your head.
My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it.
There’s good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found anymore.
You lie.
Who’s sleeping in the second chamber?
If I’m more noble than you, you’ve done me wrong.
Take on someone your own size: if you kill me, boy, you’ll have killed a man.
The tawny cat has meowed three times.
My lord, what do you want?
Okay, now it starts!
She provoked me with her lying mouth, accusing me of crimes I didn’t commit.
Now, madam, undress and come to bed.
To which we all appeal.
Is he still alive, good uncle?
I’ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey.
And harm is getting close!
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the kindness of his heart.
Well, if you have to go, you have to go.
Come away with me.
Gentleman, I am not the same man I was before.
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter.
Cesario is my name—your servant’s name—fair princess.
Tell her you heard us, and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun.
You really don’t recognize me, father?
I’ll tell you what, Prince: a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn’t change my mood today.
Is it because of 
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.
Oh, royal Caesar!
The count’s messenger, Cesario.
I’m suddenly afraid.
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me.
Now, fellow, what have you got there?
It’s all the same.
He’s very serious, which is right for someone in mourning like me.
And now you’ve changed?
Oh, this is a painful time!
In that case it’s your imagination that’s interesting, not the play.
There she is, over there.
What time is it?
Hey, love, I say!
Her husband, you rascal.
Ma'am, my master’s coming.
I feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm.
May a plague strike both your houses.
His neigh is like a monarch’s command.
I’m warning you.
Thank God, thank God!
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
Don’t tempt me to suicide again.
Oh God, I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples, as king and queen!
Oh, dear God, don’t let me go mad!
Oh, Cassius, I’ll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me.
If there’s any reason we shouldn’t get married, I urge you to tell me.
Good thinking.
You won’t see anything like that, sweetheart.
Will you come with me?
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door.
Well then, I know who you are.
In private?
These are tricks.
Be patient, sir!
Good Mr. Mustardseed, I know you very well.
Good morning, Prince; good morning, Claudio.
I think his soul’s in hell, my lady.
Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die.
If we meet again, then we’ll smile indeed.
Anyway, he is what he is.
Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend.
When things are at their worst they have to stop, or else improve to the way things were before.
And buried, noble Tyrrel?
Let me tell you, the man who marries her will become very wealthy.
He’s just as terrified of Sir Andrew.
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea.
Anyway, sir, should I go see the lady?
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors.
What, does the news only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you.
In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man.
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings.
He is an animal worthy of Perseus.
By risking the second arrow, I’d often get both of them back.
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner?
Alas, you misunderstood everything!
Well, should we head to the Tower?
I don’t know, madam.
Everyone.
Me too, lieutenant.
which any peace-lover can do.
Oh, so you’d give me all your tediousness?
Check and see if he’s breathing.
I drink to you.
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind.
What’s your answer?
Can’t you see I’m eating?
If only all struggles ended this well.
Look, if you love me, stay.
All this so suddenly?—Edmund, what’s going on?
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord.
My mask is like the roof of the poor 
Portia!
Yes, you already hurt me in the church, in the town, and in the fields.
Ha, ha!
I’ll go hunting again tomorrow, I think.
Come, come, we’re worrying about the worst-case scenario.
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything.
When it comes to defense, it’s best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems.
Is it four o'clock?
I hope you go senile soon, sir, so you can become a more foolish fool!
Ask your daughters for another one.
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady?
Draw your sword and get on your toes, because your assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.
If, then, that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar, this is my answer: it’s not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
Make us your agents of revenge, so we can praise you when we’re victorious!
After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration!
Come down.
It would be much appreciated.
Here I am, your slave—a poor, sick, weak, hated old man.
Goodbye, good sir.
It’s much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one.
Thank you, sir.
My old brain is troubled.
What, from myself?
It’s true!
But I don’t have any good sides.
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go find my lady Olivia— Get out, demon!
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme, and I rejoice in paying the penalty, as I beg God and you to pardon me.
Why, so did you.
Since you are a lying hypocrite, we must look after you.
Who is this?
The generals want to speak with us.
Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours, anyone would believe you?
Let me play the lion too.
I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed.
What’s the difference?
It doesn’t matter.
Clever lies.
I do dare, and I say that you are the villain.
Death has sucked the honey from your breath, but it has not yet ruined your beauty.
I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker.
If they’ll do neither, we’ll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings.
Just ignore him.
You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing.
It’s women crying, my good lord.
Well, then it will be dry.
Everyone who can hear has heard about it.
What, I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I’m doing?
Then the liars are fools, for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them.
Who’s shouting?
Why, you’re absolutely right, cousin.
And whatever we do, we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants.
Who’s there?
Whatever seems best to you.
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower.
Listen to this.
Where are your tenants and your followers?
I don’t know,” he said, “any house, wife, or mistress.” My message, which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth, ended up being carried back home by my shoulders.
Take me.
As for him, I never think about him.
All I’ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already.
When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything?
Welcome to the open air again.
But that’s just a fairy tale.
He is, because he told Antonius to tell you he’d be there tomorrow.
Who’s there!
Please don’t be angry.
If your Majesty would like, I’ll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like.
Who’s going to keep me from them?
Now please listen, sir.
That’s right.
I went to many places where I heard news about her, but I couldn’t find her.
I’ve worked it out.
What’s the matter?
Why, what do you imagine his name to be?
There isn’t a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome.
I figure that once he’s crippled me, I’ll beg by showing off my beatings.
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn!
Get up and tell me how you came here.
She was fickle and unfaithful, like water.
Herald, spare yourself.
Wait for mine, sweet soul.
Not from crying.
Where are my good fellows?
Goodbye, my sweet lord.—Goodbye, my sister.
Is this true?
Is the visor of my helmet working better now?
If you poison us, don’t we die?
But I made an oath, an oath, an oath in heaven.
I’ve seen the whole thing, and it’s completely worthless—unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines—which they memorized so painfully—are funny.
Have faith, love me, and you will get better.
Didn’t you hear their shouts?
Yes, madam.
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes!
How’s the prince?
Too late is more like it.
My dear lord, you know how passionately stubborn the duke is.
The Prince’s fool”!
What foolish thief brags about his crimes?
What do you think will be the result of this storm?
Please come with me.
Hastings loved the prince’s father so much that we won’t be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince.
I have no desire to go outside, yet something leads me there.
Is the king leaving here today?
I’ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute.
I’ll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger.
Here he comes.
You should tell Antonio what you hear—but don’t do it suddenly, because it might upset him.
What do you say, James  Well, I don’t know what to say.
I mean please go into the house, sir.
Our forces are ready for them.
I don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore.
You’re both wrong.
Then I’ll pay you for doing what you like.
Don’t damn yourself.
Caesar, you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you.
But in your daughter’s womb I will bury them.
Please come with me.
Fabian, bring him here.
Nevertheless, it’s all one—the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers, and there are salmon in both.
I think you’re denying what you really are.
He intends to do something bad to you.
Not me.
Then I’ll see you again?
What’s that trumpet?
It looks like these witches are scared of swords.
Here, Peter Quince.
Maria, our lady wants you.
What mercy can you show him, Antonio?
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey.
You’re right.
Hail to you, thane of Glamis!
That’s foolish.
Thisbe?
As for my daughter Katherine, this much I know: she’s not for you—more’s the pity.
I could not forget you, since I never saw you before in my life.
Banquo!
And if she starts to drop off, I’ll rant and yell until I wake her up.
I hate to say it, but it’s almost two and we won’t get there before suppertime.
Two great enemies, in fact, enemies to my peace of mind.
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds.
No, I swear it.
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty.
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father?
Sin from my lips?
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel.
I know this quality in you, Brutus—it’s as familiar to me as your face.
And he would have deserved it too.
And let us swear to our resolution.
This is the place.
He is coming.
I wouldn’t do it for a nice ring, or fine linen, or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats.
Well, what was your dream?
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were, and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is.
I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor.
I’ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him.
Damn you!
You can’t trust them.
What will we say is our excuse for being here?
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus.
You can’t tell a story simply when it’s a lie.
Where was she born?
As Edgar, I’m nothing at all.
Lady Beatrice is angry with you.
This is Trebonius.
Let me tell you, my friend, I’m almost insane myself.
But soon I’ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father.
So it’s not my business that’s making me sad.
Tell me where you learned these strange things, and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting?
There have never been orphans who’ve suffered what we have.
God be with all of you, princes.
I’ll do everything she wants me to do.
His name!
We don’t have any music that can’t be heard.
And so, on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought, our scene flies swiftly on.
Didn’t you go to her for a purse full of ducats?
Goodbye.
What kind of scheme do you have going together?
Merciful powers, keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest!
Answer when I call your name.—Nick Bottom, the weaver?
I’ve served you since childhood, but I’ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop.
I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife.
That really would be kind.
And here I am, with that piece.
Didn’t I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you?
I became his guide, I led him and begged for him, and kept him from suicide.
But listen, if 
What time is it?
I’ll stay, my lord.
I’ve been up all night.
Oh, but these are our friends.
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message.
Whoa, man, you dare to support someone who’s been proclaimed a traitor?
If arguing makes us sweat, the real trial will turn that water to blood.
I have it ready for you.
We’ve all come out to see what will happen.—Go, Hercules!
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you.
Weren’t you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night, right after he’d raped her?
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady’s good graces always reason themselves out again.
A beautiful voice, I swear.
I’m really worried about that.
When has anyone ever put you down like that.
I like her more than I can say.
I don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them.
Let me see what he looks like, so when I see another man who resembles him, I’ll know to avoid him.
In that case, he’s more obliged to you than I am.
If I ever see it, I will challenge you.
Can’t you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage?
Didn’t you hear it?
Okay, but please not before me.
Yes, as kind as snow to a harvest.
That her father’s brother wants to be her husband?
You would make a nasty suitor.
I held the sword and he ran on it.
Therefore, in case he does, we must hold him back.
Didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season?
Oh, sir, impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions.
And so—?
A man, sir.
If she is, you can sue me for lying to you.
Something’s wrong, the man sounds panicked.
I probably am too young for you.
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial, as I have more reason to mourn than you do.
We will speak about this further.
I hope you’re not drowned.
Why are you looking for me?
It’ll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice.
I’m speechless.
Who’s closest to him?
Why are you knocking so hard?
I’ll have none of your money.
I’m a surgeon to old shoes.
Your life is stretched to its limit.
Don’t do this!
No, Kate?
Uncle, please give me your dagger.
What do you have to tell me?
who can control his fate?
Curse your families!
Give me your first, Mr. Mustardseed.
Is everyone here?
No, that’s not true.
Enough, enough.
Goodbye, sir.
That’s a Cornish name.
Goodbye.
Help me!
I hope to make the sender blush for it.
Yes, let her die and rot and go to hell tonight.
Get to the point, since we already know the truth.
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans, and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you.
Go home!
But I am thankful that you have found it.
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending, and I was born under the Big Dipper, so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed.
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast.
But now, I tell you—keep it to yourself, though—those enemies of mine are being put to death today, and I’m better than I’ve ever been.
What kind of question is that!
She was here just now.
He’ll run after her.
What do you want?
Cobble you, sir.
If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard, then play that.
I’m going to go drown myself.
Honest, yes, honest.
Bring me this plant, and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles.
And so, good morning to all of you.
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements?
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you, either in his words or his face?
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion!
But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast.
For the love of God, help us!
Your scolding is somewhat overblown.
No, the whole day, and all night too.
Can we go?
Shall we go see this fortification, men?
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady.
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king.
Look, here comes our honored hostess!
Brother John Bates, isn’t that dawn breaking over there?
If he backs down, he’ll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God’s earth, in my opinion.
Now that’s done, I’m going to walk on the fortification walls.
Oh Lord, they’re fighting!
Talkers aren’t good doers.
But I’m sure he’ll get even with you.
It means peace and love and a quiet life, supremacy based on reverence and profound respect, and—not to go on and on about it—everything that’s sweet and happy.
Don’t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword.
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured.
Is his ship sturdy?
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man.
Bring the villain forward.
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything.
You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
Lysander, where are you going with all this?    
If not, it’s true, this parting was well done.
I know who you are.
He says he’ll come.
And how would we go about doing that?
Yes, he was.
Yes, and his relative, too.
Ah, my poor princes!
That’s always true.
Come on, Iago.
What is this?
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do, we can almost forget our own misery.
Who’s there?
Is it gone?
Why do you say that?
But never mind them—if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would’ve forgiven him.
Is this my prize?
Oh Buckingham, now I’m going to test to see if you’re truly made of gold.
Their names are marked.
I don’t know about that.
The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more.
I can’t go any further, sir.
Since you left, I’ve been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams I’ve ever had, my lords.
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well.
Yes, just now, my lord.
I swam ashore like a duck.
I’ll never speak to you again.
I wish it were day!
It’s not because I don’t love you.
For a necklace your husband had him make.
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not.
Yes, at Philippi.
That’s not necessary.
Help, dear lord, or the battle will be lost!
Carry him gently to bed, and every man be ready at his post when he awakes.
It will be hard if “Cambio” loses her.
Nothing is what it is.
I’ll bet you a hundred marks, my Kate puts her flat on her back.
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs.
I’ll be thrilled.
It’s a horrible thing to die when you’re not prepared for it, my gracious lord.
I’ll reward treason with blows, I promise you.
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret, who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot.
Antony.
Sunday is just around the corner.
And I think this is his house.
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests, okay?
You’ve offered an excellent interpretation.
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands, the wise head defends itself at home.
Hey, Mountain, hey!
Don’t go back until I’ve carried the corpse into the marketplace.
Oh, gods, make me worthy of this noble wife!
Who’s ruining my rituals of true love?
That is exactly why we wanted you here, your lordship—to avoid the public carping and complaints.
Alas, why would you heap all these responsibilities on me?
The rest of the king’s guests are already inside.
Who do you mean?
But there’s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster.
As for the food, it will be served in covered dishes.
Ah, I’m an odd kind of guy.
You’re awfully eager to fight.
Please allow her to do this.
Are you out of your mind and deaf too?
Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware.
Aren’t you my father?
Please—and I’ll pay you plenty for this—help me conceal my identity, and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want.
What shall I do for you?
Yes, kind sister.
If you cut both their throats, then you are the absolute best.
Leonato, am I standing here?
That’s all there is to it.
Oh, what a bloody end to all this!
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio.
But do you think that’s what he’s aiming for?
Still, it stands to reason that he mustn’t betray his fear, as it might dishearten his army.
But let me try my luck on the boxes.
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves, and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror.
Come, mistress Kate, I’ll join you.
My name’s Stephano, and I’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise.
Oh, well.
It is three o'clock, and, Romans, before night, we will try our luck in a second battle.
Let go of his arm.
What are these things we’re looking at, my lord Antonio?
Knowing how much I loved my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom.
You’re torturing me, Tubal.
You’d think everyone was asleep.
You’d make a good fool.
Because I didn’t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails, or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh.
Are you mad?
She knew an old song called “Willow” that reminded her of her own story, and she died singing it.
What about Stanley?
Come with me, my dear Cordelia.
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner.
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does.
Are you my son?
Therefore, every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do: clear his conscience of any stain.
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence.
Lead those away who will follow you, and we’ll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar’s death.
Well, enough about them.—Come here, Catesby.
That’s more than we know.
All right.
But we haven’t made any preparations.
I don’t know her, but I know her father and he knew mine well.
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband.
Your Honor’s is unhealthy talk.
Do you know any, count?
Never a moment of peace!
Madam, if I do as well as I think I’m going to do in these dangerous, violent wars, you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you’ve ever had bad!
There is a crab-apple here.
This is Decius Brutus.
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad voice.
We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our goal.
Surrender, dog!
Oh, don’t worry about it—we’ll dip your    I’ll get you for that one.
It was just removed from from the heart of—oh, she’s dead!
What, do you think we’re Turks or savages, instead of Christians?
Look with your ears.
Not a word.
Silver.
How’s it going, Shylock?
Let lightning spit fire!
No, in its tongue.
When only one or two men have all the good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.
M”—why, that’s the first letter in my name.
Now go, leave me.
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say?
What should I do?
How did her eyes get so bright?
I know you’ll offer nothing less than that.
I could drown the world.
Don’t run away—stay where you are.
Please, my lady, just confirm that you’re the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech.
He claimed he knew that, and that’s why he’s come to speak with you.
I didn’t see anybody use you for kicks.
Go, lad, and find out what the trumpet’s sounding for.
So go to your deaths, poor miserable wretches, the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure.
They howl about banishment.
My own ears heard it, and you know it.
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness, serving you loyally and wholeheartedly.
Tell us, Othello.
But goodbye.
You stole it from her?
Has Romeo killed himself?
You’re afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear?
Your beautiful eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine with love.
How awful!
I know a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all.
My dear clever Ariel, listen carefully.
With who?
Can I have a word with you?
So now Sweno, the Norwegian king, wants a treaty.
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders.
Why “let it strike”?
I am a gentleman of a company.
And when has he ever been known to wash his face?
Both of you are very welcome here.
Relent, and save your souls.
It’s a deal!
Stand still.
My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience.
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor.
When all these extraordinary things happen at once, we shouldn’t say, “These happenings can be explained rationally.
I’ll shut up now.
If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this?
No, we’ll all go there to bring him.
It’s him!
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Murderer!
Alas, our poor country!
Of all places, I don’t like the 
Your Majesty didn’t present yourself as the king.
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up, then I’ll lose my son twice.
She speaks daggers, and every word stabs.
Yes, go ahead and moan, because you killed the sweetest, most innocent woman who ever lived!
Gremio, this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca.
You’re thought to be the most 
Did you inform them of that?
The town is besieged, and the trumpet calls us to the gap, and we talk and do nothing, by Christ.
Let’s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks.
Your Majesty is quite right.
I did.
You can’t do that.
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth.
I’ll pretend to be the housewife for once.
The king, his brother, and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind, and the rest are grieving over them, sad and astonished.
Heaven knows I am.
He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him.
Brutus, you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes.
Some are born great—”
I’m speaking purely in analogies and comparisons.
That’s him.
I’ll go straight for that proverb with “To hell with the devil.” You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as “A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark.” You have overshot.
If you look closely at Alexander’s life, Harry of Monmouth’s stands up fairly well by comparison—for there are analogies in everything.
Please don’t play games.
Where would Othello go?—Oh, look at you!
Oh, you mighty gods! 
Stanley, pay attention to your wife’s doings.
What’s the message from the English king?
Risk everything for lead?
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity.
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed, then it would be best to get it over with quickly.
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate, he will mock death, and he will think he is above wisdom, grace, and fear.
Is it true, is it true?
A house, a person?
Listen, listen!
Alas, you don’t know.
As wicked as I am, they were slaughtered because of me, not because of anything they did.
That’s an odd thing to say.
Where are your sister and Hortensio’s wife?
We’ll follow you.
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord, your king, your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land.
We’ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords, then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room.
It’s true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter, and she loves him—or else they’re putting on quite an act.
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living.
He’s walking over there, sir.
But don’t delay.
I hope to God he keeps his promise!
I’ve looked at many ladies with pleasure, and been
Go in, or we’re done for.
Long live Theseus, our famous and respected duke!
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad.
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again.
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness deserves thanks.
But when push comes to shove, they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl.
You’re supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back.  
Please let her speak.
What is this?
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise, I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine, because if you’d been what I took you for, there would have been no offense.
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court?
Oh, what a wonderful new world, that has such people in it!
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges?
Please, father, since you’re weak, act like it.
Here are the keys, and there is the duke, sleeping.
I never gave him reason to be jealous.
Goodbye.
Yes, but not out of fear.
You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so.
Who brought it out here?
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife.
I love you all the more for not liking it.
That’s a good point.
Yes she has, and by keeping celibate, she wastes her beauty.
But is he often like this?
Tell me.
Yes, my lord.
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles.
Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back.
My lord of Orléans, and my lord high Constable, are you talking about horses and armor?
That’s very true, mangy rascal, when it pleases God.
While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle.
You can go straight to hell!
Can’t he pay back the money?
My name is Mary, sir.
Teach me how I should think and speak.
In a king, the sight is unbearable.
Take  Beatrice, have you come because I called for you?
I’m not a fighter.
Good morning, gentlemen.
I made my father angry, so I went to Friar Lawrence’s cell to confess and be forgiven.
Thank you kindly.
Come with me now, and help me out.
You just fell the height of ten ship masts, straight down.
Actually, I’m still feeling some pangs of conscience.
Now be quiet.
I am not some fiend of hell: you can’t get rid of me with spells.
Well, well, you have a careful father, child.
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once.
Ha, ha!
Go ahead, I’ll yield to your power.
Grandmother, this would have been a biting joke.
Listen!
And if you’re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be, that’ll be good.
Give me my sin back.
Isn’t he a horrible man?
Go away and let me die.
Look at me now!
But for the whole world?
She’s the one who’s got to do it.
Put him within the reach of my sword, and if he escapes, may heaven forgive him as well!
I must go in. 
But if you have to swear, swear by your wonderful self, which is the god I worship like an idol, and then I’ll believe you.
The stuff you had at the Centaur, sir.
Quickly, tell me how.
Where is the number of our English dead?
Was a man ever so tired?
I will have to go on a journey to death soon, sir.
We’ll talk more about this later.—Egeus, I’m overriding your wishes.
No, vain illusion, so intricately bound up with a king’s rest.
Even my tears burn me like molten lead.
Let me stand here until you remember your reason.
We You won’t pay for the glasses you smashed?
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side.
Oh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that?
Do that.
Dear Duke, please listen to what I have to say.
I will see them.
I could swear this is the real Vincentio.  
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don’t want any company.
Yes, right away.
Oh, what a relief!
Hurry up.
And did you see the handkerchief?
Why do you need even one?
Oh, I wish I were a man!
What a horrible slut!
But when I say so, I swear she turns white as a sheet.
Let’s get started right away.
This story breaks my heart.
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree, with the help of her powerful assistants, and left you there for twelve years.
Let’s do it with no show of anxiety—no, with no more fear than if we’d heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing.
Weren’t you banished on pain of death?
Saint Davy’s Day has passed.
Show me.
Plantagenet.
We’ll meet Macbeth there.
From this, I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end—just as many arrows, shot from different points, converge on a single target; just as many roads meet in a single town; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea; just as the many radiuses of a 
Can’t any prayers reach your heart?
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
I know exactly how to proceed.
Yes, sir.
Give me your hand, first. 
Oh, heaven help us!
You seem a little depressed about this.
Would you like to taste the banquet?
They couldn’t, they wouldn’t.
Yes, you’ve been a ladies' man in your time.
Goodbye.
Take me to the garden.
Is that you, Iago?
Your highness, could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth?
I just did my duty, sir.
Meanwhile, I’ll make a list of props that we’ll need for the play.
Could you really do such a thing, for all the world?
Signior Leonato, listen to the friar’s plan.
What?
Twenty crowns.
But I agree, sir, that we were locked out.
He’s not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body, but praying, to nourish his attentive soul.
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
We’ll perform all the holy rites.
Come, sir, no more.—Oswald, come here!
She is welcome to stay.
If she returns my jewels, I’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her.
But let me see, by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen.
I would choose to take my penalty.
You’re right, Lysander’s admirable too.
Well, he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation.
He’d really be your proxy if he married you.
She’s as dead as the cold ground.
He won’t get the better of me.
Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed.
Are you sure we’re awake?
Oh, the things men dare to do!
I had only one child, one poor child, one poor and loving child, the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself, and cruel Death has stolen it from me!
Here come the conspirators.
Come with me tonight, and you’ll see a man enter her bedroom chamber—even tonight, the night before her wedding.
No, Octavius Caesar, we’ll respond to their charge.
What is your name?
And my sweet master, I received no gold.
Did I do anything good to myself?
She’s wise, if I’m judging her right.
I’ll walk up and down and sing a song, so they’ll know I’m not afraid.
Then tomorrow at dinner?
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia.
Stop!
No, by no means.
I’ve acted like such a villain!
I said “your husband.”—Do you understand that word?
I could imagine he’s divine, since I never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before.
Go back to your lord.
Just listen this once.
I’m coming in peace.
Sir, enter the castle.
You could’ve done this without your beard and gown.
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man.
Oh, he’s really gone.
Two or three of us have seen strange things.
Oh, no.
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him.
I hear it now overhead.
It’s a cup, closed in my true love’s hand?
I have done wrong, so I will suffer wrong.
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won.
Yes indeed.
What do you say?
The news I have to tell your majesty is that Buckingham’s army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall.
I’m a friend, a friend who knows you well.
Who’s that?
And if I were king of it, you know what I’d do?
It’s half of all my money.
My soul and not my child!
Mankind’s role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals.
What, you want them to weep our horses' blood?
I’ve been looking all over for you.
Macbeth!
Enough!
But why am I telling you this?
It’s your turn now.
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves.
Why are we talking about this?
She blushes at the slightest thing.
Doesn’t the sun shine palely down on them, as though in contempt, killing their fruit with frowns?
Then it must be Banquo’s.
The problem is in what the letter says, as far as I can tell.
Someone adored me once, too.
Reluctantly, I agreed–alas!
What do you think about Thursday?
That’ll happen soon enough.
But tell us, did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea?
Amen!
They’re just flattering me.
No doubt it will, my liege, if each man does his best.
Yes, they have.
I tell you, Captain, if you look at a map of the world, I’ll bet you will find, comparing Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, see, are very similar.
Call the numbskull back in here.
Well, he’ll be dead, so he won’t see anything.
Indeed, before he fell down, when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown, he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut.
Are you headed to the Tower?
Let’s assume that she has a reason, which you don’t know yet: have faith that she’ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today.
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more.
I can’t explain it.
So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers aren’t hired.
He doesn’t seem to be alive.
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths, but the good is often buried with them.
That’s very sensible, but you missed my sense: I meant Hortensio is afraid of you.
No, Lysander.
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down, crying, “Ow, my butt!” and starts coughing, and then everyone laughs and has fun.
Dear Sir Toby, don’t do anything rash tonight.
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend.
Heaven knows you’re as unfaithful as hell.
On me, though I am limping and deformed?
Drawing your sword on a woman?
Challenge the count’s young servant to a fight.
Give me my sword.
If you see me without it, you can be confident I’m dead.
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness.
Will I hear from you soon?
I hid under this monster’s cloak to get out of the storm.
You know where I live.
That he had sex with you.
We’re being haunted.
If you read this, Caesar, you might live.
Signed,    The poorly treated Malvolio.” Did he write this?
Madam!
What three things does drink make a man do?
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow?
You’ve said what you have to say now.
His father was Philip of Macedon, as I remember.
Please hear what Goneril is saying.
The testament!
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
You know where she is.
Come on, tell me in broken music—for your voice is music and your English broken.
Harder, harder.
The island must be mild, and have a temperate climate.
I’m afraid to think how I’ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you.
I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood.
I’m not that stupid.
Nothing, except your true love for my lord.
Who’s coming?
Then, gentlemen, we can count on trouble.
Well, Oswald?
You give your best praise to the worst women.
Why, man?
Do you see?
Tybalt is lying over there.  
That’s too long.—Servants, leave her and me alone.
Where is he?
I’ll bet we’re both thinking the same thing, master.
So be cheerful.
I humbly say goodbye.
We answered them, blow for blow.
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city.
Listen, my lords— We’re in a bit of a hurry, Leonato.
I represent her.
Did you mention that Edward’s children are bastards?
What is this fuzzy logic?
It doesn’t make either of us happy, I know.
Oh, I’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes!
I hate no-good drunks.
Well, sir, the gown is not for me.
I’m feeling very low, and I need to sleep.
I can imagine more than I can say—I have more on my mind than words.
A gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him—these are the two fools I need for my plan to work.
But as a gentleman and a soldier he’s promised me he won’t hurt you.
How’s the night going, boy?
You told me she got them, and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon, but nothing like that ever happens.
Go around the forest, moving faster than the wind, and make sure you find Helena of Athens.—She’s lovesick, and her face is pale from all the sighing she’s been doing, because sighing is bad for the blood.
This place is full of trouble, torments, and amazements.
My name is Edgar, and I’m your father’s son.
Old age always makes people act funny—even wise people, but fools more than anybody.
You call this a scale?
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them—which most of our city did, for the sake of friendly trade relations.
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow’s feather from the poison swamps.
Thieves!
Thank you.
My lord, they’re waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio.
What’s wrong?
Benedick, did you notice Signior Leonato’s daughter?
You’re going to pay for this, Roderigo.
She’ll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up—even if it’s a lion, a bear, a wolf, a bull, a monkey, or an ape.
If she restrained your rowdy knights, she had such a good reason that you can’t blame her for it.
Keep him away from me!
No, my lord.
Sweet mistress—I don’t know what other name to give you, or how you’ve figured out mine—you seem as
Take up my mistress' gown for his master’s use!
Oh, God!
It’s too bad I’m so hard-hearted, because I really don’t love anyone.
Me, ma'am?
Good luck.
I’ve done everything you accuse me of—and more, much more.
I’ve separated them into groups around the island, just as you ordered.
Run and proclaim it in the streets.
Now, what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime?
They have me tied to a stake.
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you’ve gotten rid of such a criminal.
What kind of beard should I wear for the part?
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France—I cannot tell vat is  To kiss.
Send him on his way quickly.
Evil can come from good, just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we have to walk carefully.
Have you heard something of her in your letters?
Let me go.
Are you going to provoke me?
I assure you he can.
There’s plenty of time.
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it.
By the way, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
On a night like this, pretty Jessica, in a bad mood, said outrageously wrong things about her lover, and he forgave her.
And anything else?
I can’t run away.
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff.
Come on.
Don’t I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and cannot love you?
Then tomorrow we’ll find that they feel only like eating, not like fighting.
They should advance immediately, because I sense Octavius’s side is a bit fainthearted right now, and a sudden push would overthrow him.
And as king I’ll love you forever.
What’s it to you?
He’s a marvelously witty fellow, no doubt, but I’ll outmaneuver him.—Come over here; I’ll whisper a word in your ear.
For we may take pity on you, even if we can’t pardon you.
Here’s someone coming in his pajamas, with a candle and weapons.
I can see you don’t like this gentleman.
When the barrel’s empty, we’ll drink water.
Why, sweetheart?
Name them.
If you keep on the way you’ve been going, you’ll kill yourself.
Has it been decided that Richard will be  It’s been decided, though not yet officially announced.
May God give their souls rest.
What’s your name?
With those plays in mind, we hope you’ll receive this one kindly.
What does she say, madam interpreter?
Go wake Juliet.
Damn it all to hell!
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief?
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by.
There’d be no kingship— He wants to be king in a place with no kingship.
The sky frowns and scowls on our army.
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers.
Boy, your words can’t excuse the harm you’ve done to me.
Don’t miss our feast.
Where is he?
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke.
And so, beautiful lady, I’m standing here just like that, wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is.
As a child, he took such a long time to grow up that, according to his rule, he should have grown up into a gracious adult.
Come on, men!
Are you trying to make fun of me?
That our grandmother’s soul could end up inhabiting a bird.
I’m sorry I said anything.
I’m forty-eight.
Come on.
What, there’s going to be a masquerade?
But let me hear the letter from your friend.
Yes, sir.
Now let’s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs.
Let me enjoy my privacy.
You kick me out, he kicks me back.
You are to bring his daughter to the supper.
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you’ve been ordered to stack!
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself, your Majesty.
What does  You’d have a great hairstyle if you had.
She was worried about my absence, and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong—which I found out at the same time as the news of her death.
You’re rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages.
What’s going on, my lord?
Did you plan Cassio’s death with him?
What’s that noise?
But did you tell him she cheated on him?
Good friends, go in and have some wine with me.
Your husband.
Wait a minute.
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad.
Don’t talk to me.
There’s no reason to be afraid.
I’ll get my revenge before I leave this house.
If he stays in this country he’ll be found.
Welcome home, Grumio.
How many months do you want?
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury.
You can be a eunuch, but I’ll be mute.
Goodbye, Edmund.
And I was just going to yours.
Quiet!
Is it true that good King Edward has died?
Well, we all have our special gifts.
Come on, come on.
Age is the thing that nourishes.
Come here, Ariel.
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore?
Oh, go away, you’re a boring fool.
You’re a senator!
Well, I’m nearly finished.
Who, me, my lord?
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up.
Well, we’ll speak more soon.
Well, that’s really my job.
His nurse?
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan.
He was in bed with— With her?
Yes, that’s quite likely.
Isn’t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on?
My honorable, reverend master?
Gregory, remember how to slash.
I got him to leave, and made up an excuse for your trance.
Why, sweet Othello—   I haven’t done anything to deserve this!
Go on.
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief!
What time is it?
I’d never do such a bad thing, not for the whole world!
There’s no crab-apple here, so don’t look sour.
Write all this
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast, ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea.
Make room!
Very suspicious.
What do you think of these quick-witted folks, Gremio?
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine, but when he touches them, they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven.
When you see leeks in the future, I hope you keep mocking them.
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss.
Oh, that most wicked fiend!
No, my good lord.
The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command at all hours.
Hello, my friends!
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love?
You take the bill and I’ll take your yardstick.
Did it really work?
The graceful and renowned king is dead.
Oh, how silly we are!
For that reason he sends you this good news—that this very day your enemies, the queen’s relatives, will die at Pomfret.
It’s the smartest partition I’ve ever heard speak, my lord.
to have a stupid wife.
Why, dear child?
Yes.
I was told that you were violent, proud, and sullen.
Will you come to bed, my lord?
It’s been proven that Lady Hero is innocent, that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived, and that Don John—who has run away—is the source of all the trouble.
He has a ring of mine, worth forty ducats, and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it.
Don’t disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven’s will.
You mean I should groan and tell you?
Cicero, I’ve seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees, and I’ve seen the ocean swell, rage, and foam, as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds, but never before tonight, never until now, have I experienced a storm that drops fire.
Who’s coming with her?
Rage on, blow!
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated.
I’m very sick, too.
Don’t deny to him that you love me.
But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love.
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland?
And as wise as a goose.
He is what he is.
Please tell me seriously what you think of her.
My dear lord, if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity— I know what you’re about to say.
Orsino, sir, please don’t call me those names.
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me.
In what chapter and verse of his heart?
It’s not true because she separates us.
I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s searching eyes.
Hopefully when I get married, I’ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty.
No, he loves and cherishes me.
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable?
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep?
I don’t know.
I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine.
Goodbye, Jessica.
There’s a picture of me inside.
We won’t hold back any of our wisdom.
I wish them all safe trips home.
A pretty pathetic monster.
You should ask instead if it’s possible that any criminal could be so rich.
Madam.
Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head.
My niece already thinks he’s insane.
No man must know.” What if this someone were you, Malvolio?
I’ll miss you, Ariel, but you’ll be free.—Yes, you will, yes.—Go to the king’s ship in your invisible state.
What if she’s pretty but stupid?
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well.
The things I’m saying are fair and honest.
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds, as you call them.
I swear on my life and honor, he’ll sit here in the stocks until noon.
If he won’t stop when he’s told to, then he isn’t one of the Prince’s subjects.
I’m ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say—for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him, not the king.
What a man, young lady.
Good morning, my friends.
Oh, my son, my son!
Eyes, do you see?
Here comes a messenger.
Doesn’t that make you want to cry?
You can’t mean it, Tranio!
And so do I. I think we all do.
No, just listen to me.
Hail!
I can do anything!
Oh, no question—it won’t style itself.
What do you think I should do?
Come on.
Anyway, go tell your master I am here.
He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice.
And just in time, here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe.
It’s absurd.
Help!
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries?
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools.
Oh no!
I’ve sworn I’ll never sleep with him or talk to him again.
Murder, murder!
Good day, Catesby.
Oh painful, painful, painful day!
Why, to keep the eyes on the sides, so that you can see anything that you can’t sniff out.
What’s that noise?
Know that I am Brutus!
If they have spoken the truth about Hero, I will tear her apart with my bare hands.
Come on, then.
It’s a nice hand, an open one.
Congratulations, lady: you resemble a most honorable man.
I remember this fellow—he once played the eldest son of a farmer.
Go.
See you soon.
I’ll give it back to you.
Oh Margaret, Margaret, your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastings’s miserable head!
The princes left your daughter here for dead.
Will it?
Burn!
A duke who is noble in name and character.
You’ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me, but I’m as sane as you are.
What does he say about Brutus?
Now it’s time to get back to my studying, since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner.
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it?
Until then, God be with you!
And what if they won’t go?
Who put out the light?
We found him in the churchyard.
Let’s go for it.
Here, my lord.
Isn’t that what they said?
Thank you for saying that.
Your ear is good.
For her I’ll be strange and condescending, and I’ll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away.
The police are here.
Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, come forward.
Perhaps there’s still some poison on them, to make me die with a medicinal kiss.
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you—girls from noble families—who have already become mothers.
I didn’t have the heart to say no to him.
We’ll start a fire.
So you’re telling me to give it time and wait for summer.
And that would be—?
Can’t I say something?
Cesario, come here.
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely.
I told you before, and I’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor.
Yes, I forgot—three months. 
Let’s go inside.
Let me go with him.
Don’t move, dog.
Tell us your name, sir, truthfully.
How could it be wisdom!
I am their mother.
You’re right.
Yes, that’s the one.
I am content, if that’s the way you want it.
What did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm?
Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters.
If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, their men must all be drowned.
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind, so you may believe me.
If you interrupt it, he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy.
I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this!
Let’s move.
Sir Toby, madam, your relative.
That’s enough.
Strato, you’ve slept this whole time.
They’re friends—Ratcliffe and Lovell.
Oh, what a fall it was, my countrymen!
Even the goddess of patience couldn’t look at this and be patient—it’s too horrifying!
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
We’re men beached on the sand, hoping to be washed out by the next tide.
Is it really true?
Continue, then, and don’t forget to perform all of the rituals.
Hey!
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly, you’ll see.
So, sir.
Maria, take care of this poor fellow here.
He doesn’t know what he’s saying.
That pretty boy, Claudio?
I take all responsibility for my decisions.
I’m the man she wants.
Me too, my lord.
Howl, howl, howl, howl!
Caius Ligarius, I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that’s made you so thin.
Go back with her?
But let me place this wreath on your head.
What country is this, friends?
I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity.
He struck me from under your arm.
I admit the cape.
Hmmph!
What, not even to pray?
I’ll back you up.
I know I will too, if it’s the last thing I do.
But sir— Be quiet, Kent.
Tongue, do not speak.
That’s true, my lord: I did get this ring from her.
They burn for revenge.
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight.
Why should you fall into so deep a moan?
An awful monster!
I’m not talking about proof yet.
Whore, your lover’s dead now, and you’ll be going to hell soon.
I am the greatest, but I was able to do the least.
Nell.
Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days.
Wait, let me hire him too.—Here’s my fool’s cap, a token of my gratitude.
What are you talking about, man?
You’re right—I’ll go quietly.
Oh yes.
How did you lose your breath?
What are your names?
I’ll just stay here till the storm passes.
You can’t blame anyone for it anyone, I say.
As for the Jew’s contract, don’t let it be a factor in your plans.
Farewell, good neighbor.
But as for now—before two weeks have gone by, I’m going to send some people packing.
Let’s have him land and solemnly proceed to London.
Be quiet, Signior Gremio.
Yes Signior?
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil heart.
Then we’ll go out, even to the marketplace, and, waving our bloody swords over our heads, let’s cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Kneel then, and wash.
Don’t you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph’s nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell?
You know, if you were anyone other than Brutus, that speech would be your last.
You’re not supposed to get old until you’re wise.
No, wait.
She’s beautiful, if my eyes can see.
I’m not one of his punk friends who carries a knife.
Don’t you recognize me, father?
I tell you, I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream.
I’m not marvelous, sir, but I’m certainly a maiden.
I’d risk my soul for that.
My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink.
You aren’t wood, you aren’t stones—you’re men.
Give me my robe, because I’m going.
I’m smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter.
He says she has no equal.
What’s her name?
It has caused the downfall of many kings.
Not at all!
These ones, then, will be assassinated.
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies, enchanting everything you put in.
Oh, Antony, don’t beg us to kill you.
I want my bond.
Is your master awake?
He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not.
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld.
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him—you and the other servants.
Oh Lord, who’s that crying?
You’re now within a foot of the cliff’s edge.
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?
It’s a sweet lozenge that you choke on.
I can’t find it.
You’ll find us both at Crosby Place.
Are you going to start eating worms and flies?
Regarding the Dauphin, you can speak to me.
Yes, they are.
It’s certain that she is dead, and she died in a strange way.
I haven’t slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar.
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming.
Go and get her dressed.
Just listen a little more, and I’ll bring you up to date about the present situation, which is the whole reason I’m telling you this story in the first place.
How beautiful the moonlight’s shining on this bank!
Let me lick your shoe.
Take three times your money.
I’ll fight every one of these devils if I have to, one at a time.
Was that him just now?
I need people as trustworthy as you.
It seems to me that your voice has changed, and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be.
Let it be who it is.
Oh, Julius Caesar, you are still powerful.
She’s still at the monastery, kneeling and praying for a happy marriage.
Your husband, being saddled with a shrew, projects his own suffering onto my husband.
And that’s all there is to it.
He’s changed a great deal.
Antonio, oh my dear Antonio!
Yes, here it is.
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it.
Your lieutenant, Cassio.
Yes, but he’d deny it all.
It won’t be long before I’m back.
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour.
You’re an insolent little boy.
Curse the day!
You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door.
He’s near death, and Roderigo’s dead already.
Come with me, boy.
Her
Great Queen Juno is coming.
I beg you, daughter, don’t make me crazy.
I’ll do it, sir.
You just said they had to face her.
To tell the truth, though, I think the duke hasn’t lost a single man, except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph—I don’t know if your Majesty knows the man.
Well, learn to make jokes at the appropriate time.
Your mistress’s marks?
Come here, you.
I’ll put it on anyway.
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream, and even when you were awake, it was as though you slept.
Yes, my lord.
Listen to this, King: as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover, the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons.
Well, even if he is her father, I’m sure she wouldn’t want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders!
Now I see that you can’t call anything good except in right context.
I’ve felt neglected recently, but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind.
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles?
What are you doing, Caesar?
Put on a happy face, and welcome your friends.
I don’t have the thing that makes time fly.
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter.
I’ll take responsibility for it.
You are the best of the cutthroats.
You take out your sword too.
The street is narrow here.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Not at all, not at all.
What’s that?
Why do we party until we’re like animals?
You sound like a cattle dealer: that’s the way they sell bulls.
How did she get that candle?
I would’ve given it to you this morning, but a madman’s letters aren’t Gospel, so it doesn’t matter much if I’m a bit late.
Informed them”?
Fled to England?
Sir, that would be me and my partner.
I, who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals?
What do kings have that private men do not, besides the pomp of their position?
There’s going to be a storm.
Sir Toby needs help right away.
If not, the Fates are on the side of the traitors.
Goodbye, you beautiful, cruel woman.
If this letter falls into your hands, think carefully about what it says.
For you, our swords have blunt edges, too dull to harm you, Mark Antony.
Please, sir; crack jokes over lunch.
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless.
There isn’t enough leek left for you to swear on.
What are you going to do?
I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
Let’s dance to “You Jerk.” You mean, “Shut up, you jerk”?
The chicken is burning, the pig is overcooked, the clock has already struck twelve, and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek.
And you’re all sizzle.
It must be.
Not old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy.
Call me when it’s lit.
Corporal Nym, be a man and put away your sword.
And listen!
She will be pleased.
She’ll confirm everything.
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war.
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job.
I think it’s later than that, sir.
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock.
Oh, killing that child was the dirtiest, most merciless deed there ever was!
He’ll just think an idiot wrote it.
I’m sure his majesty will recover his health soon.
No, it was just a dream.
He’s killed three people, and he’s so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die.
You know the law.
Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate, and together with some others they’ve set off for Dover, where they claim to have powerful friends.
Good Lord, how bright and splendid is the moon tonight!
A false conclusion.
You, my slave, were her servant at the time, as you admit yourself.
Oh, but I’m worried.
But if you fail, you have to leave immediately.
Friar!
By nine o'clock.
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this.
Good morning to you, friend.
I pitied you, worked hard to teach you to speak, and taught you some new thing practically every hour.
Don’t give up yet.
Come on, I’ll escort you to dinner.
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia.
Besides, there’s no king, however pure his cause, who, if it comes to a trial by combat, can rely on using completely blameless soldiers.
Well, when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites, the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns.
But let’s see once more what the gold one says: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” That’s Portia!
What should I swear by?
What sickness did she die of?
The sound is going away.
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener.
Don’t ask me what I know.
I’m not insane, Sir Topas.
They are my daylight, my life.
May God in heaven bless you.
No.
Come on, what would you say about me?
My life has run its circle.
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph.
Yes, she will.
With crisscrossed laces?
That’s why your desires are wolfish, bloody, and ravenous.
God help me, I love you!
Go and get our stuff onto the ship.
Be the person you know you are, and you’ll be as powerful as this person you fear.
While I was looking for a flint to light it, I found this paper on the window, sealed up like this, and I’m sure it wasn’t there when I went to bed.
Give me your hand.
And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it.
All cooped up together, just as you ordered, all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather.
Goodbye.
So that’s what I’ll do, not because I love her but because I’ll get something out of it.
Humble greetings, great master!
She will wither and come to a bad end.
Let me wipe it off first.
Oh no, good Cassio!
Most noble Caesar!
You should get a wife!
You’d better not wear your dagger in your cap that day, or he might slap your head with it.
As for those who have, I beg you to excuse the gaps in time, and the many people and things that cannot be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form.
his daughter, Katherine, with some insignificant, unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry.
No.
This is it, for now.
The crows flying down below look as small as ants.
We can’t wait here.
Moron!
If you had foul words in your mouth, then your breath must be foul, and foul breath is nauseating.
The king won’t live, I hope.
Follow”?
Yes, do you hear me, Balthasar?
I’ll follow you.
Oh, you men are made of stone!
If they refuse to come, get physical—use a whip if you have to, but get them out here to their husbands.
And women.
What are you waiting for, lords of France?
No, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed.
Your statue spouting blood through many holes, in which many smiling Romans bathed, means that you’ll provide great Rome with sustaining blood, and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood.
I know where he is.
We’ll watch them starve to death first.
That’s me you’re talking about, the playful wanderer of the night.
The duke will be here tonight?
Monster, I smell like horse piss, which is making my nose pretty upset.
With his own lightning bolts; I’ve shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars; I’ve opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them, letting them out with my powerful magic.
Where are you now?
Don’t you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom?
Whatever kind you want, I guess.
If we’d been able to put on our play, we would have had it made.
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now, you’d feel sorry for them.
This is a small house.
Write them together—yours is just as good a name.
I believe I have some choice in the matter, sir.
If not, I’ll challenge you to a duel.
But only hint at this vaguely, because, as you know, my mother’s still alive.
If you’ve offended him, I’ll fight you.
Please, pay him immediately.
Or are you just pretending?
In that case, if I can wear a mask, let me play Thisbe too!
By his dress I can tell he’s my countryman, but I don’t recognize him.
He was on his way here with your wife.
Sir, you need a drink.
Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career.
No, not sure ones when we’re talking about something unsure.
I’m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you.
Everything will be all right.
Mistress, both the man and his master are possessed.
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from, has rejected me!
No!
Oh, I wish I had my rosary!
My lord, he’s afraid you mean him harm.
Who are you?
I will do so.
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve, saying, “Tomorrow is 
Foolish dogs, blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples.
It’s all right, since they left their food behind, and we’re hungry.
Look, here comes Helena.
No, monster, not me.
Please calm down, uncle.
There’ll be hell to pay for this.
Launcelot and I can’t agree on anything.
Oh, sad day!
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed.
Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight?
Officer, I’ll take the responsibility from you, and the blame too.
Well, call them back again.
A snake could do that as easily as you could.
My father’s studying hard, so he won’t see you.
You wouldn’t have dared, out of fear for your life.
Oh, and then at the very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the Jew’s house.
What do you have to say to me?
My soul is made out of lead, and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can’t move.
Don’t go out today.
In his greatest need, even they will desert him.
No, I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you.
You too, Fabian.
To Dover.
So why aren’t our eyelids heavy?
Come here, Tyrrel.
Unfaithful, my lord?
According to an agreement, I should wear it myself.
I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea.
It’s dinnertime, my lord.
Let him command me, and I’ll do whatever he asks, no matter how violent.
Read it.
Just send him here, and I’ll persuade him.
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now?
This box was tested in the fire seven times.
Are you her husband, boy?
Chop off his head.
If someone like me is fit to be king, let me know.
Be angry whenever you like, it’s all right with me.
Please walk softly, so not even a mole hears us approach.
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him.
Then there’s still a chance.
Look at the three little dogs, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—all barking at me.
Can’t you understand what I’m saying?
That’s what she was expecting, and you let her down.
If I may say so, your Majesty, your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward, the Black Prince of Wales—or so I’ve read in the history books—fought a very brave battle here in France.
That with a series of legal writs, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death.
Uncle, this man is a Montague—our enemy.
I don’t know, sir.
Because it will make you angry, and that will get me another beating.
For besides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage.
What?
You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew.
Dear man, calm your rage.
I’ll have my head cut from my shoulders before I’ll see the crown so misplaced.
I leave him in your care—but oh, if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him.
Your case is better than that.
They’re as opposite as hot and cold.
Stop that alarm from ringing, it’s scaring the islanders.
What hope is that, may I ask?
Liar and slave!
We’ll speak again tomorrow.
How do you both plead?
You look pale and wild as if you’re going to hurt yourself.
And if I, your poor devoted servant, may ask you for one small favor, you will guarantee my happiness forever.
I’d like to get to know you better, Mr. Cobweb.
I hope you sleep peacefully.
Hold on a second.
I, Wall, have done my part.
Wrong, evil traitor.
I didn’t give her any ring.
I can’t let my lips say his name; “No man must know.”
Do you have anything else to say?
Is it good news?
Right or not, it’s made you the Earl of Gloucester.
No, he just gets reality completely wrong.
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich.
Forgive me.
Three months from twelve months of the year.
You’re wrong, sir, very wrong.
Get out!
You’ll have to bear with me.
Once again, what’s the news?
It’s entirely possible.
But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband.
Being too old to marry someone young.
Listen but don’t speak to it.
Heaven help her!—Get him out of here for now.
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow!
We’ve got to give them and take them, my lord.
Woman, stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you.
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well.
And you, good farmers, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the vigor of your upbringing.
Leave me quickly.
That word “judgment” makes me feel a bit guilty.
Princes and counts!
It might as well be the same with Caesar.
I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story.
So there’s a rift between Othello and Cassio?
Yes.
Run after that obnoxious messenger, the duke’s servant.
Therefore tell me, fairest Katherine, will you have me?
Let’s go!
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that.
Let them put fear in your heart.
If the Jew cuts deep enough, I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.
And that Mr. Shore’s wife has nice feet, cherry lips, pretty eyes, and a very pleasant way of expressing herself.
I’m coming, my lord.
Ha, ha, ha!
But his ambition—for that, I killed him.
Yes, that’s all true—but what do you mean by it, my lord?
Let him be the devil if he wants to, I don’t care.
Did you hear this, Gonzalo?
Have them click their heels together and don’t dare touch a hair of the master’s horse’s tail till they kiss their hands.
In every one of the lords' households I have a servant paid to spy for me.
Go.
If he is too insistent, tell him that romance is like a dance: it has its own rhythm and timing.
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there.
Caesar’s better qualities exist in Brutus, and we will crown him.
I’m going, I’m going.
Isn’t every living thing condemning her?
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did.
But the way he’s divided the kingdom recently, nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more.
You’d better think up a way to defend yourself.
Sir, this is the truth: you and the rest—all the people who have ever talked about her—have all been wrong.
I found it in my room, and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes.
Oh, you devil, you devil!
I did that to him.
Normally I would ask you what your name is first.
Nurse, give my regards to to your lady.
And let no one suffer for this deed except us, the perpetrators.
Yes, if the devil tempts you to do good.
But can I have some hope?
There’s no ambiguity here.
Yes, my lord.
Do tell.
Now, Antony, our prayers have been answered.
Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger.
Pay you?
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax, stooped over with old age and ill will?
He’s crying out for you and swears he’ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you.
Get out of here!
Or I’ll deliver your insults to his face.
She’s a perfect woman, it’s true.
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he’s not a real lion.
Good evening, brother.
Oh yes—to smell  This is Signor Antonio.  
Everyone keeps yelling, “Here they come!” Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige.
Is he all right?
I’ll call for you soon.
He is my dear friend, your Majesty.
I’ll lock up the doors, grab some more ducats, and be with you right away.
I see.
Claudio, take my daughter, and, with her, take my fortunes.
Please be quiet.
It looks to me like it’s burning in the Capulet tomb.
But since the gibe glanced off me, ten to one it hit you both straight on.
What are the chances of his getting better, lords?
Hello, you idiot.
Be lenient, dearest!
Speak, I command you.
If you’re joining together to right these wrongs, I’ll go as far as any one of you.
But since this has happened, you should fix it for your own good.
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear.
He gives BIONDELLO  Here comes Baptista.
I’m really a pitiful singer.
Why, so did you.
Oh, oh, oh!
He wants to be crowned.
Help!
When you were wooing Desdemona, did Michael Cassio know about it?
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball, but it’s not smart of us to go.
And what about him, Tranio?
I’m not sure about that.
I want to speak with Clarence, and I came here on my legs.
I’m going to sell all my land.
All to our advantage.
Let’s have the evidence.
For assuredly, you are so near the abyss that you’re bound to be swallowed up.
God, not our strength, be praised!
But
Here comes my man, the man I’m looking for.
Madam wife, they say I’ve been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years.
Kent, father, sisters!
But as far as I can tell, people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing.
It’s worthless.
We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter.
It’s time we hit the road.
What business is it of yours?—Father, be quiet.
Who wishes that?
Sir Toby, I’ve got to be frank with you.
She took that ring from me.
No, sir.
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well—he’s just civil, as Seville as an orange, with the same jealous-yellow complexion.
God protect you from tornadoes, evil stars, and diseases!
You’ll hear more from me by midnight.
Which of us are you referring to?
Dear sister, it’s unfair to me—and unfair to yourself—to turn me into a slave.
Here is the money.
Is this possible?
Run to your houses, fall on your knees, and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude.
You’re a traitor.—Off with his head.
Where are your leather apron and your ruler?
Because you’re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell—you keep interrupting my thoughts.
Is the duke of Exeter safe?
Is that a good idea, do you think?
I see you like to make big offers, sir.
God bless you.
I hope you’re an expert in your field.      
Two of my brother’s men, all tied up!
Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword.
If he struggles, use force!
Yes, my lord.
My dear fool, because my brother died.
Whichever of you acts shy, I’ll swear she has corns.
Believe me, my friend, since I have the power to stop the prosecutors.
I’m telling you, I hardly know myself.
If I miss this, let me be boiled alive.
Pass on the command to halt!
And 
God say, “Amen”!
Oh, I know.
I’m too young to remember anything like it.
No, the one I gave you.
Once more I come to ask you, King Harry, if you’re ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat.
Say it again—just one word, and my hand, which killed your lover out of love, will kill your far truer lover.
Yes, it’s just clothing.
My king, they haven’t come back yet.
Take him to my sleeping area.
Lean forward.
Two reasons.
What disease is he talking about?
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations, then you can come with us.
I want to be this Duke’s servant.
Let playful people with light hearts dance.
Neither good nor bad.
Where are those bastards?
Your mother’s name has become a threat to her own children.
If you got what you deserved, you would learn some respect.
Maybe she can’t find him.
I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket.
Should I get your nightgown?
I’m not sorry, either.
Away, away, be gone.
I’ll do it with all my heart.
The watchdogs bark.
Why are they running away?
Yes, on his front.
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird’s nest and happily shows it to his friend, who then steals it from him.
Well, thank you.
But I didn’t want you to think that I’m hasty in my emotions.
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one, and I don’t love him any more than I love my bastard.
Let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions truthfully.
Here comes the lady.
Would you like some more sauce to go with it?
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her.
You’re Lear’s shadow.
From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back, calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage.
Isn’t that strange?
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it’s good night for real.
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over.
Tell us how it happened, noble Casca.
Good night.
I never felt it until now—two thousand ducats in that diamond, and other precious, precious jewels!
So goodbye until we meet again.
At your service, madam.
Hail!
Your voice is loud and commanding, but you look like a working man.
You’ll find out everything in due time.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it to you.
Before I fall asleep, I entrust my soul to you.
Deal?
Yes, good fool.
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face, she was the fairest creature in the world—and even now she has no equal.
So it’s no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster.
He’s here, sir, but please don’t bother him.
Yes, he’s the one who first told me about her.
Just do it carefully.—And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished, for the crime of telling the truth!
Go now, and pretend to be a friendly hostess.
Damn it, this isn’t funny.
One of them is too much like a painting of a man—he never speaks—and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy, always chattering.
There are women like that out there, no question.
Look for yourself—see the top of the cliff way up there?
Because when rich villains need poor villains' services, those poor ones can name the price.
Tell me why you did it.
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought.
Transform your grief into anger.
I really want to sleep now.
In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys.
Keep your money.
Knock, knock, knock!
There’s no bravery in an unfair fight.
Wake Duncan with your knocking.
Give me your torch, boy.
It’s too late to go to bed now.
Let me at her!.
Let’s proceed to the field.
All these quarrels are about me.
From now on, take care of your messages yourself.
You were tricked into fighting, Gloucester.
The gown was made just as my master was directed.
Whom should I knock?
Take this. 
I’ve said nothing wrong.
It’s better that you didn’t kill him.
I was born to speak cleverly, not seriously.
Let me ask you something in private.
Don’t you hear it ring?
What’s that trumpet for?
For God’s sake, would someone bring me a mug of beer!
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man.
But maybe you don’t like mine, or his, or hers either.
Feed him apricots and blackberries, with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.
Do you want to go see him?
I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself.
Examine them yourselves, then bring me your findings.
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return.
I won’t miss any chance to send my love to you.
Come on, let’s all go inside.
I respect the soul very much, so I disagree with his belief.
Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore.
As soon as the deed is done, you will be in my favor and I will promote you.
Good heavens, those are difficult directions.
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane, I won’t be affected by fear.
I’m asking you to understand my point of view.
But wait a minute.
His crime did justice’s job by taking Tybalt’s life.
To be good-looking is a matter of luck, but to read and write is a natural gift.
Blab my nonsense!
Find the people whose names are on this list?
I don’t think you would.
I’ll run away from you and hide in the bushes, and leave you to the mercy of wild animals.
Too quickly, we boarded a ship.
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper, which I inherited from my mother, makes me forget how I should behave?
Come on, we have to follow the leaders of the dance.
My lord, I have thought over the request you just made of me.
Be quiet, you are Antonio.
It doesn’t excuse your cruel behavior.
You hear the charges.
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful.
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife.
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty?
Maybe until after Theseus’s wedding day.
I was.
My husband is dead.
Well, other men have bad luck too.
My master’s a total Jew.
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right.
I’m leaving your court now.
I might do something I’ll be sorry for.
Tell me, why did the king arrive with such a small entourage?
Master, you were so focused on the girl herself, I wonder if you missed the main point here.
It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time.
My prayers, you hussy?
No.
God bless you for doing this.
No, my lord.
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
I have.
I’ll recite something for you, guy.
How?
I wish there wasn’t so much dew on the ground.
Life is a story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning.
No.
But I beg your pardon.
He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him.
Tell me if it’s good or bad, and I’ll wait for the details.
Go inside, Nerissa.
When we’re in love, we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds.
I’m your little dog, Demetrius.
Forgive us, my lord.
Or rather, do what you feel like doing.
Here comes the messenger with your niece.
Down with the Capulets!
I have to stay with the servants, who are with our camp’s luggage.
Here’s an empty seat, sir.
When you are gentle, you shall have one, too, and not till then.
I rejoice in his good fortune.
God has blessed you with a good name.
Why, the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death.
Cassio doesn’t know you.
Me too.
You’re acting stupid, Casca, and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have—or else you don’t use them.
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home.
Octavius, lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field.
You can’t get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don’t bother.
Aren’t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming?
Now go, set up for dinner.
I have forgotten your name, but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly.
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain?
Besides, how have I offended you, my friends?
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night.
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer, and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse.
Wake up!
I will sit here in the middle.
This is the place.
A witty if a cynical reply.
If your affection for me doesn’t convince you to come, don’t let my letter do so.” Oh, my darling, make your arrangements and go!
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—Trumpets, blow!
That’s enough for me, then.
But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time.
You go and talk to the duke so he won’t notice I’m helping the king.
Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it.
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike.
I hope that God restores you to health.
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me?
Brutus, my country’s friend.
Go then, goodbye.
I won’t give up this child for all of Fairyland.
Now, welcome, Kate.—And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
I’ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you.
I’ve changed my mind about that.
It doesn’t sound as sweet as it did before.
No, it hasn’t, my lord.
Won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated?
To put it plainly, I’m afraid I’m not quite sane.
This is good.
Is it that aggressive?
This epitaph will hang here forever, Continuing to praise Hero after I die.
Yes, I want it, and I’ll get it.
And to make it even clearer, we can tell them that I’m playing Pyramus but I’m not really Pyramus—really, I’m Bottom the weaver.
Who’s talking to him now?
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood.
Seven days and seven nights?
No, not at all— All right, all right.
You know what they say.
CALIBAN  Stephano!
I’ll give him some liquor.
Get out of here quickly!
Go ahead, then.
And if he ever has a wife, let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now.
Then right next to him I saw the murderers, dripping with blood, their daggers rudely covered in gore.
Get to the point now.
It’s shameful, and we have to make some changes right away.
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit?
Whatever you are, thanks for your advice.
So get ready to cut off the flesh.
Who are you?
I said she was.
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning”—please, tell me what you meant by that.
I say that I love you more than he does.
I forgot about the reward.
Gentlemen, on to the bridal dinner.
Oh, monster, we know secondhand clothes when we see them.— Take off that gown, Trinculo.
If he were dead, you’d be weeping for him.
God bless you, Bottom, God bless you.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye.
No, I’d rather you stayed here.
Is this true?
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.
No.
I hope he’s grown a lot since I last saw him.
I have a daughter.
What, my lord?
Lock the doors.
Thank you.
I never saw you before in my life.
Naked in bed together, but without doing anything?
Let’s do that.
Wake up, I say!
I won’t beg the gods to punish you, or caution you to fear their judgment.
This lantern represents the moon.
But I never spoke the whole time?
Don’t you have any sense at all?
Give him a noose to hang himself.
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I’ve strived mightily, with all my wits and energy, to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties.
If it pleases you, your highness, why don’t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company?
Hortensio, what’s all this about?
Nobody I care about more than myself.
I’ll prove that I’m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself.
Good afternoon, my dear lord!
You lover of that damned whore, you’re talking to me of “ifs”?
The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough.
That’s true.
If you’d known how much that ring meant, how much the woman who gave it to you is worth, or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring, you wouldn’t have let it go.
Yes, the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him.
The other half goes to the state.
And then his clerk, who went to a lot of trouble with the writing, begged for mine.
He made my heart leap for you.  
No.
She’s yours.—Come, Ariel!
I’m off to Venice.
I swear to God I’ll get revenge.
It’s like a cockleshell or a walnut shell, a joke, a prank, a doll’s cap.
They are, my lord.
Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made.
I’m tired of it, and you say you’re tired of it too.
When I said that, I told you the truth.
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn’t even arrived to tell us whether they’re coming!
Taste your legs, sir.
I’d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you.
Get out of here, you measly, lying wretch.
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth.
Oh, I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could!
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger.
But they are dead, and you killed them, you slave of the devil.
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword.
And yet I’ll still have plenty.
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness.
Uncle!
Christ, it’s a disaster.
No, I have a commitment.
Am I not wise?
Well, but what time is it?
You’re a villain!
Good morning, neighbor Baptista.
Goodbye.
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough.
It’s a deal.
I did, kind lady.
If you forgive us, we’ll make everything all right.
I can’t blame you, old lord.
Listen!
Is there more news?
Go!
Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you.
I’ve never known any woman or seen a woman’s face—except my own in the mirror.
Valentine’s Day is over.
Then why am I worried?
Let me see.
Treat me like you would treat a dog—kick me, hit me, neglect me, try to lose me.
Richard, the duke of Gloucester, hates you.
Romeo killed Tybalt.
In cash.
Be violent, bold, and firm.
Lady Beatrice, have you been crying this entire time?
Go, tell the Prince.
No, good Sir Toby.
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn’t be as ready to die as I am now.
I can only do it by lying, my lord, but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me.
Tell me that you’ll accept my love.
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again.
Come on.
How is she?
Hail, brave friend!
Welcome back from Mantua.
I’ll confess to you that I love him.
Iago has kept his word.
He would just see me for what I am, a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples.
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, follow Fluellen at a close distance.
Yes, as safe as her brothers' lives were.
Give her this key, and tell her that there’s money in the desk that’s covered with a Turkish tapestry.
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned.
The  It’s too bad there’s more of the Moor than there ought to be.
But what love could make my Lysander leave me?
Here they come.
Madam, keep up hope.
It’s time for me to say goodbye to you.
Give my love to my kind husband.
No, absolutely not.
Dear son, you’re alive!
Come on, please sing.
Then make a circle around Caesar’s corpse, and let me show you the man who made this will.
Good Metellus, go to him now.
Is it my mother?
You make me so happy.
Good night.
We thought he was a coward, but he fights like a devil.
Look, here comes Cassio and my husband.
Where is Montjoy, the herald?
So, if they die unprepared, the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they’re finally being punished for.
Would you like to hear some music, my sweet love?
Why, no, sir.
I am resolved—to let him live.
He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack.
No woman’s heart is big enough to hold all my love.
Your lily-white lips, your cherry-red nose, and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone, gone forever.
Yes, you’re right.
It persuades you and discourages you.
I’ll go alone.
I’ll recite a prophecy before I go.
And then?
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan.
O flesh, flesh, you’ve turned pale and weak like a fish.
Unless you’re talking about his love for this kind of foolishness—which, judging from his appearance, he has—he is no fool for love, as you pretend.
Come, husband, let’s go to lunch.
I am friends with you all and love you all, on one condition—that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous.
Say anything.
He swore that he’d never get married, but now, despite his earlier protestations, he loves ungrudgingly.
The sailors are all below deck, sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them.
You lie.
crowned by the golden sun, observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature, French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years, since they were babies.
Answer me this, please: where’s the money I gave you?
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak, like women.
Hold on a moment, and listen to my advice.
Say no more.
Back so soon?
It used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die, and that would be it.
Go back, slave, or I’ll knock you one across the head.
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail.
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.
But I reversed the death sentence.
In the meantime, come home with me, and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him.
What worries have kept you awake tonight?
What did I do wrong?
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble?
Unleash the dogs in the western valley.
I have to go.
Goodbye.
I’ll take a look at your letter.
Fight it like a man.
Until I know for sure, I’ll humor her.
Strike!
I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.
That?
I’ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies.
And Cassius too.
But then again he’s never really understood his own feelings very well.
A likely story!
Oh, Fate, come and cut the thread of my life.
Welcome, good Robin.
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather.
Why is that cauldron sinking?
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great!
Oh, oh, Edmund, I don’t like this monstrous business.
Your father’s sons would make excellent husbands, if only a girl could catch one for herself.
You’re taking it more seriously than I meant it.
Is that chain you’re wearing the one you promised to give to me?
Go, daughter.
Hang on a minute, here’s some money for you.
Good monster!
Grief seems to be contagious, for my eyes, seeing the tears in yours, began to fill.
Hurry.
Let thunder rumble!
This is the man.
And I’ve never met any men besides you and my father.
Go.
Good!
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform.
You, constable, are representing the Prince himself.
The Moor’s killed my mistress!
If you tickle us, don’t we laugh?
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats?” Or should I bend down low, and in a humble and submissive voice say:
hundred times.
Good husband, come home soon.
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them.
Fool, fool, hey, fool!
You slander her, you devil.
My pretty children, both of you misunderstand me.
I was engaged to both of them.
And now who but you knows whether I’m yours?
If you do intend to live, then mourn.
I’m coming, slut!
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money.
What does the silver one say?
Listen, Clitus.
Nurse, where’s my daughter?
Please keep in mind we’re only here out of spite.
The Constable of France.
What, should I stab him while he sleeps?
May a plague curse both your families.
Bring him here and ask him.
Tear him apart, tear him up!
Where’s lady Portia?
Just as you got Milan, I’ll get Naples.
Yes, you’re speaking very well.
Go to him, petition him.
Isn’t that him?
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them.
Peace to you, my lord of Burgundy.
There’s more knocking.
Where is that knocking coming from?
I honor him for being brave.
Can God be so jealous and hateful?
We’ll let you.
He’s not jealous?
It’s now late at night, and actions must accommodate bodily needs, which we’ll satisfy with only a short rest.
You’ll both help me, right?
Why, sir, I told you an hour ago that the good ship  This fellow’s gone mad, and so have I. We’re in some kind of dream world.
Where are they?
Where is the king?
I haven’t seen him for two days.
It’s always like this in times of change.
We need a calendar!
Hurt him in eleven different places.
You don’t think you can teach her?
It will heal and be as good as new, and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again.
This villain is much quicker than I am.
I have an adventurous fairy who’ll go seek out the squirrel’s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts.
I’m here, my lord.
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees.
What?
When you just want to eat, it’s better to do that at home.
You’ve humiliated him, lady: you’ve put him down.
Why, so did you.
Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning.
Here, Fluellen, stick this in your cap.
When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die.
If our father were dead you’d receive half of his revenue forever, and you’d have my undying love,      Edgar.” Hmm, what’s this, a conspiracy?
Yes—as you and the rest will find out as soon as he’s home.
I wouldn’t think much of it even if it were heavier.
Goddammit!
I’d give forty pounds to be safe at home right now.
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up.
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music.
Please, let me review the contract.
You are all most welcome here; please make yourselves at home.
Carved it up and down like an apple tart?
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news.
Help me out of here, quickly!
Too fast is as bad as too slow.
You dog, you peasant!
Come on, sir, please.
What news?
You’re not paying attention to me.
A friend.
Yes, my lord.
Oh God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
Let him thank me, who helped him get there.
Go away, get out of here, and stop following me.
Let me wrap up your head, and it will feel okay in less than an hour.
Their dying shouts broke my heart!
Absolutely, if you can find a wife by then.
Oh cowardly conscience, how you’re torturing me!
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever, hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother’s lament.
Oh, hello, father!
You disgust me, you little bug!
On top of this, they’ve either burned or carried away everything that was in the king’s tent.
She’s a lot like you.
So go out there and give him what he wants.
Calm down, sir, please.
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house?
It sets you up for a fall.
All hail, Macbeth!
If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealth’s sake, treat her with more kindness.
And I get sick when I can’t look at you.
I’ll answer for everything.
I thank you, lady.
It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks.
Until then, we’ve said enough. 
I’m the one who— I’ll get right on that.
You’re bothering me.
Her eyes are vicious, but yours are comforting.
Let go of my hand.
All these friends are my witnesses, so I swear to you, I swear by your beautiful eyes, in which I see myself reflected— Did you hear that!
Oh, I hate looking at his face now!
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with, I’d crack heaven wide open with my laments!
She’s busy and cannot come!” Is that an answer?
Oh, you idiot!
Oh, monstrous!
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell.
Well, I won’t.
Am I all alone?
If this were a play, I’d complain it was unrealistic.
Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do.
Oh, the man who avenged her could ask anything of me!
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Can I have a word with you privately?
Good point, and well said.
And they’ve been plotting things together.
Well, good luck to them tonight in bed!
Shut the doors after you.
Tell us, Othello.
The fool will stay.
Well, let’s have it, Grumio.
The night has been chaotic.
How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus.
Sir, sir, sir—
With him out of Venice, I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal.
That’s true.
Please don’t, sir.
You don’t know why we came to visit you— Yes, and so unexpectedly, at night.
Therefore, accept my everlasting farewell.
I’ll go with you.
I have news—old news such as you never heard before!
I’m ashamed that I yielded to them.
Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news.
Hero is his only child, and his only heir.
Oh, good Demetrius, will you find him for me?
Yes, and don’t let anyone come in, or else I’ll break your head.
How long have you believed in astrology?
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully, I will give my answer and acceptance right away.
No, my lord, unless I could have another husband for the work week.
We used to think so too.
Now die, die, die, die, die.
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract, you’re just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud.
If you come to me after tomorrow and say, “That’s my glove,” I swear by this hand, I will take it and give you a box on the ear.
Maybe I’ll never go home again, Iago!
But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence.
I wish that were true for both our sakes!
Give me another horse!
My lord, he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him, since he had no idea they were coming.
Very well, my supreme lord—that’s what I have to call you now.
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night, lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights.
Adultery?
Come, come, you’re making fun of me.
Nothing else, for God’s sake!
May God bring you sleep!
Can you do that?
Let go of him, peasant, or you die!
I’ve left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted.
Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius!
I assure you, sir, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
I’ll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe’s face.
Good lord!
But where’s the money?
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb?
Be quiet, be quiet.
I can’t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way.
I’ll fetch him.
Yes, she said that.
But you don’t love me.
Me too.
Sweetheart!
You haven’t seen anything, then?
And now he’s gone.
Oh, grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me.
Reading their mail isn’t as bad.
Please let me know your plan, Bassanio.
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero.
Even that I could put up with.
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius.
You’re under arrest, sir.
The sun glints off our armor.
And he’s rubbed himself with perfume.
Lucius!
Onward, lover boys!
How did you get this letter?
God knows I loved my niece, and now she’s dead—slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue.
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods.
That way, he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers, weakening his own capacities, while we, lying still, are rested, energetic, and nimble.
We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers.
I can’t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse.
Me neither.
What friend?
Let any man perish who isn’t ready now!
Come on, let’s get to the banquet.
You have to pretend to be your niece’s father, and give her away to Claudio.
Or tell me, my sweet love, what you’d like to eat.
I’m headed for your niece, sir.
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was.
You’re making a terrible racket out here!
He can’t go in there because of the candle.
Dromio, bring this money to the Centaur Inn, where we’re lodging, and wait there until I come.
It was love that performed these miracles.
Go on, my loving lord.
It’s like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing.
I’ll go, sir, and I won’t bother you.
Caesar might act like that.
For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony.
Who was it that came here?
I believe it won’t stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm.
Kind Tyrrel, will your news make me happy?
Take me to Octavius.
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night.
Let me say “amen” quickly, before the devil comes in and stops my prayer—because here comes the devil, disguised as a Jew.
There isn’t any other way, unless you took on another form and became someone else.
Wait!
I say she shall.—And first begin with her.
Madam, if you can find a man to deliver the poison, I’ll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it.
There was no Signior Montanto in our army.
They’re ready, my lord.
Whatever I say, or think, or do, you’re continually contradicting it.
Twenty crowns?
If he’s as good as a saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me.
You know, you’re right.
Good day, Lieutenant Bardolph.
I’m sure he’s been kidnapped.
He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king.
So young and so cruel?
And me, too, my royal sovereign.
Many thanks, Signior Gremio.
What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you?
Why did you once seem lovely to me?
But who’s that coming this way?
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
A nice, soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France’s hard, cold ground.
Then the wrong man is dead, and sweet revenge has gone wrong.
These are tricks of the imagination, and this place is filled with magicians.
And your lies caused this murder.
Tell me, don’t you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina?
It was a color he never did like.
Good roaring, Lion!
Yes, if a woman grows up to be a man.
Back then, I called you “a poor, imitation queen,” a badly reproduced copy of what I was, a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow, a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell, a mother only teased with two beautiful children, who would soon die.
Yes, that’s my husband’s name.
We seemed to have two separate bodies, but we had one heart.
Oh Clitus!    
I’m game.
Where is Duncan’s body?
Dead, dead?
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower, as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse.
I saw him holding the handkerchief!
Oh, if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren’t working today.
No, he just smiles.
To invite my former boss, the Jew, to dine tonight with my new master, the Christian.
Antonio will guarantee it, hmmm.
Hide yourself, good Romeo.
The clock has chimed midnight.
That’s  Signior Baptista, will you really be this cruel?
Do you acknowledge the contract?
Some men don’t like roast pig, others go crazy if they see a cat, and others can’t help urinating when they hear bagpipes.
Oh, be quiet.
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean, turning the salty green water to gold.
A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog.
Is this your idea of success?
Why, Dromio?
If you’re a virgin, you’ll answer this question.
Where is this man?
I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave!
If they see you, they’ll murder you.
But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it.
Who’s shouting “murder”?
Brutus will lead, and we’ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Have all his business ventures failed?
No, I’m sure it has, Volumnius.
You asked for justice, so rest assured you’ll get more justice than you bargained for.
How many wonderful creatures there are here!
Go on, take them.
Is it a weakness?
I admire your efforts, and all of you will share the rewards.
Three times in an hour I saw him down, and three times up again and fighting.
Wait!
I beg your pardon for loving you too much.
Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture, I look like a saint exactly when I’m most like the devil.
Do whatever you want, and I’ll say your insults are just a bad mood.
Where is his body, Messala?
Judging from his appearance, I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt.
Well, that’s what he’s doing—making you free to enjoy heaven.
Have her send it to me.
Did you see that?
From that cabin I’d call out to my soul.
Do you have the lion’s part written down?
You sent me to the port to find a ship.
There was no story, my lord.
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion.
Be happy that you’re alive.
So don’t advise me.
Carry them away.
Look, she’s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers.
I’ll watch this play.
Gentlemen, let go of him.
She shall not.
Sister, I have a lot to say about things that concern us both.
Now please go.
Look at Macbeth—he’s in a daze.
I’ve finished it for you, and it ends in “Margaret.” He’s turned your curse against you, Margaret.
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying.
I’m going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster.
Please, sir, be kind to me and tell me.
True,” she said, “a fine little one.” “No,” I said, “a huge wit.” “Right,” she said, “a hugely awful one.” “No,” I said, “he has a good wit.” “Exactly,” she said, “it’s good and mild; it doesn’t hurt anyone.” “No,” I said, “Benedick is wise.” “He is certainly,” she said,  She cried a lot at that, and said she didn’t care.
There’s magic in its fabric.
Oh no!
Strange things are about to happen, Edmund.
I’ve had to acknowledge that he’s my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment.
Please invite them in.
If I had three ears I’d listen with all three.
I hear someone knocking at the south entry.
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses.
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely.
What I’m saying can’t anger him.
Alas, I am the mother of all these others' griefs.
Here’s Decius Brutus.
The poor people died.
How did you get better?
Tomorrow, my lord.
If he fears God, he must necessarily keep the peace.
And a true lover of the holy Church.
My lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow.
Not in the stocks, fool.
It scares me just to hear you talk about it.
Yes, and a nice one at that.
Agreed.
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away.
So if we know that a man is a thief, should we try to arrest him?
If the witches tell the truth—which they did about you—maybe what they said about me will come true too.
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds, which are now useless, seething inside your skulls.—All of you stand there in my spell.—
My lord, I swear to you— Oh, don’t swear!
Well, good-bye, Portia.
I’m a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
Just come again tomorrow.
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham.
I’m already here, sir.
If you hadn’t shown up on cue, my lord, Lord Hastings was going to take your part—I mean, he was going to speak for you—in the crowning of the king.
I am not made of stone; I am affected by all these kind pleas, though it goes against my conscience and my soul.
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation.
Pain, yes indeed.
Damn it!
I’ve said too much in telling you of it.
I’m not sure it’s true, but just the suspicion is enough for me.
Helena, it’s not true.
I’ll wait for her here and when she comes I’ll take a novel approach with her.
Wasn’t that letter from Jessica?
Hurry up, it’s getting late.
Here comes Oberon.
You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here?
Then I’d be punished for the sins of my mother.
There go the minstrels.
You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul, you cruel Jew.
I remember the plan.
Clarence has arrived—lying, cowardly  I’m not surprised it scared you, my lord.
I’ll do it, if you help me out.
Tell me, is your tardy master close at hand?
What you say is true.
But if you were married, you’d wield some influence.
Yes, you’re absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him.
Would you care to hear some music?
Come on and kiss me, Kate.
What’s more, people at the 
No, I said his horse is coming, with him on its back.
When I like the way you look, for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask!
Wow, we’re really going to drive him crazy.
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother.
When he comes back from hunting, I’m not going to speak to him.
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of.
My good man Norfolk, hurry to your post.
If this is a dream, let me keep on sleeping!
But you’re not going to deliver it, are you?
Fine, but you weren’t harsh enough.
I know she is a hateful, brawling scold.
It’s fair for him to treat me like this, very fair.
I didn’t, either.
I’m so crazy about you!
Why didn’t they just kill us that night?
Only men whom you wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths, and for the worst reasons.
I know that, sir.
The English army, sir.
Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me.
How is my lord?
Indeed, he’s not right for this.
You should listen to reason.
Not bad; you might accomplish something.
Is it possible?
Only to be generous and give it to you once more.
In the meantime, be patient.
Just now we put him in the abbey over here, and now he’s over there.
Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her.
Appear before me now quickly— No talking.
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence.
I can’t stand her.
Swear by her foot, so she can stamp out the oath.
No lie—she screamed at you.
No eyes in your head til there’s money in your wallet?
Yes, Casca.
I’d deny whatever evidence you had against me—even if it were in my own handwriting—and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery.
You’re on.
No, we’ll sneak away at supper time, disguise ourselves with masks at my house, and come back in an hour.
Come, sweet nymphs, and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers.
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from heaven.
When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily.
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor, naked, two-legged animal like you.
How’s everyone in Verona?
But how will we keep it from being passed now, my lord?
Well, I’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan, and I have every hope of succeeding.
Why?
Is he talking nonsense?
That means it’s high time for me to go.
I think so.
Divide each man into a thousand, and there you will have an imaginary army.
And that would get us all executed.
Curse my father’s ambition!
Come on, let’s go see King Edward.
Here’s the money you asked me to hold.
Tell us about the letters that you got from France.
What a horrible world we live in!
Before I open this letter, please tell me how my good friend is doing.
Hurry, send someone immediately!
Who’s that?
What?
Oh life!
We’ll go visit Caliban, my slave who always talks to us so nastily.  
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea, singing loudly, wearing a crown of nettles, thorns, hemlock, and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields.—Send out a hundred soldiers to find him.
What did you mean by not helping me?
Cruel, cruel Death killed her.
You’ll be pricked all over, and it’ll sting like bees.
I never saw the necklace, so help me heaven!
I want to head out tonight.
Tell me, good grandmother, is our father dead?
Your disloyal uncle—are you paying attention?
Here are my keys.—But why should I go?
Have mercy, Jesus!—Wait, I was only dreaming.
How old are you?
He needs to see you right away.
Meanwhile I’ll stay with Regan with my hundred knights.
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows, and then—with public accusation, blatant slander, pure hatred—Oh God, if only I were a man!
Where is she?
She didn’t ask anything?
I admit that he’s murderous, lecherous, greedy, lying, deceitful, violent, malicious, and guilty of every sin that has a name.
And yet for all that, if she didn’t hate him to death, she’d love him to death.
No, not a penny.
The highest-ranking?
Has he, sirs?
I will pause for a reply.
Hello, Iago.
She looks like she’s washing her hands.
That’s a deal.
I haven’t eaten today.
She’s not talking to me.
Put your sword away.
What’s going on, Juliet?
Bless your heart.
Because it’s dark out, I’m afraid all this is just a dream, too sweet to be real.
Oh, she’s ten times nicer than her father is mean, and he’s the height of crabbiness.
Write to me very soon and I’ll let you know what she thinks.
I could really use his advice right now.
Wasn’t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father?
I had a dream last night about the three witches.
But tell me seriously who it is.
Death didn’t conquer 
Why, last night.
Ah well, my Kate.
If this letter doesn’t make him fight, I don’t know what will.
If there’s anyone in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his.
Curse the day!
Yes, he’ll weep stones, as he taught us to do.
Tennis balls, my liege.
But you didn’t, even though you had every reason.
Oh, are you here, Iago?
Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money?
I know what I’m talking about.
Ratcliffe, come here.
Captain, I have a favor to beg of you.
I’ll be gentle and mild.
The Lord in heaven bless you, noble Harry!
He’s slept a long time.
We have feelings.
Nym, what you say is true.
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians; but now, let him think about his own debt.
Freedom!
Please, dear, come here.
Can you help me?
How many, can you guess?
Good night.
My lord, good morning.
Cassio’s been wounded.
There is no better one on earth.
Nothing that interests me, my good lord.
I have no doubt about that, since I know there isn’t a man among us who isn’t with me wholeheartedly, or a soul left behind who doesn’t wish us success and conquest.
What do you mean by all this?
God knows I waited for you in anguish, pain, and agony when I gave birth to you.
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive.
The poor thing!
Come, why be so hesitant?
It’s absolutely true, so take good care of it.
Kill him rather than let him leave this room.
Your brothers?
Damn those men shouting down there!
I am a man again.
I’ll see her like this.
You’re famous for it.
So I guess it’s you, you silver treasure house.
Me neither, my lord.
Lock the doors, my lord.
Poor lady, she’ll go crazy when she sees it’s missing.
Where have you been, sister?
Remember what I’ve told you.
Don’t delay.
What’s this?
If not, then I’m a liar.
I want the law, the penalty, and the fulfillment of my contract.
Yes, your Majesty.
Don’t sleep so close to me.
That’s for sure.
People don’t cry when they’re mocking someone. 
Don’t refuse the love we offer you.
I swear I am.
Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring?
I’m telling you, this house is dark.
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up.
A friend.
Hey, Nurse!
Are you dreaming or awake?
My eyesight has always been bad.
Now he’s ready for 
There is a way, ma'am.
If I could get my hands on you, I’d make you care.
Have you told him all her faults, Hortensio?
Hello, sir.
You’re not being a good friend, Iago, if you even  Please don’t ask me to tell you.
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren’t willing to beat it back.
Bassanio, let him have the ring.
First, you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them.
Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant, gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him.
Explain, boy.
I assure you, sir, the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below.
Let’s hope we never need your help for anything.
What was the philosopher Pythagoras’s belief about wild birds?
We’re safe from my father for at least three hours.
Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio?
You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.
How can I help you, sir?
Oh nature, what were you doing in hell?
For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed.
Do you want to go hunting, my lord?
Let me at him.
Remember who liked your yellow stockings—” Your yellow stockings?
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight.
I intend to be flesh and blood, not airy philosophy, for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently, even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune.
Oh, let me speak!
But who was that man?
What’s she doing now?
Instead, hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness.
I’m sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you.
We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time.
If the other two are as loopy as we are, our country’s in bad shape.
I would rather wrong the dead, and wrong myself and you, than wrong such honorable men.
We’ll answer.
I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over.
By my count, I was already your mother at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.
Amen.
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds!
I should backtrack and begin with how my master, Don John, arranged for the Prince, Claudio, and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard.
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered—what more am I supposed to do?
Don’t worry, Baptista, you’ll be perfectly satisfied.
Oh, mischief has ruined our plans!
I fear that your words and your heart are both false.
For the enemy, see—and you can explain this to the duke, see—has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours.
Three or four women near me cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts.
Have your wife attend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can.
No?
She would have died later anyway.
Or thorn-bushes.
Now two things still need to be done.
Who can prosecute me for it?
Either my eyes deceive me, or I see two husbands.
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak, sorrow-ravaged voice?
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it.
This is to feel the news, not hear it.
He and I will make up.
Really, I had no intention of going for my sword.
That’s five to one.
Ran off with a Christian!
My story does raise that question.
She would make a good wife for Benedick.
So what’s going on?
Madam, I’m here.
What is his name?
We will, my noble lord.
God will revenge it.
Here, here I’ll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids.
I hope to God it’s something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you.
If he’s never drunk it before, it’ll help soothe his fever.
Why not?
My lord?
If you who are so wise can’t help, please be kind enough to call my solution wise. 
Find out where the Jew’s house is.
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast.
Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril.
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice’s love?
We’ll burn Brutus’s house.
Lily-livered coward, what’s he doing there?
I want to learn how to lie.
This is rebellion.
Come, Katherine Queen of All, reveal your heart to me in broken English.
I’ll sue him for assault and battery, if there’s any justice in Illyria.
Tell me your secrets.
But oh, poor Glou-cester!
No, and she swears she never will.
Not until we part as friends.
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors.
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep.
But that is a false conclusion, since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves.
Won’t we, Sir Andrew?
Friends, go your separate ways.
Oh, what a sinful thought!
Well, you’re not on target there.
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and terrible.
Dear friends, let’s go to bed.
Why, what is there to do before I get there?
A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, he’ll come or go as he pleases.
We’ll eat at her place.
My brother, your uncle Antonio—just listen to this (I still can’t believe a brother could be so disloyal!
Then why be jealous of a person like that?
What do you want?
If people take what he says, fine.
I’ll wait patiently.
Noble words, sir.
I’ll reward you for your troubles.
Who will advance with me?
Go home, you lazy men.
I will go out.
Contagious infection of humanity, give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know you’ve committed.
Think about it carefully.
So how can anyone say I’m alone, when the whole world is here to look at me?
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
All right, then.
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, I arrest you for high treason.
In saving you I consider myself well paid.
I’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more.
You who are so skilled in cursing, stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies.
If that’s all, gentlemen, I see no problem.
Tell me so I can be sure, though I swear I recognize your voice.
I remember very well where I should be, and here I am.
It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind.
Draw your sword, scoundrel, or I’ll slice your thighs like flank steak.
If this is so, be patient, sister.
Isn’t he an honest man?
You’ll be lord of the island then, and I’ll be your servant.
We’re probably a very valuable catch for these guys.
You’ve stolen both my job and my name!
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once?
I’ll tell you, good Brutus.
If you let go of your power to attract me, I won’t have any power to follow you.
Are your tears wet?
I will choose this one and try my chances.
A man no mightier than you or I in ability, yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight’s strange happenings.
What we do we have been commanded to do.
Let’s call for help and get them tied up again!
I’m a gentleman.
The noise is coming from over there.
Awake, my lords!
That dirty rat!
I have to obey. 
The truth will be all the inheritance you get.
Wait, sweet Beatrice.
Forget your epilogue.
Pay for something I never got?
Where are you going?
See how well she can turn?
Who’s shouting?
Father, could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man?
We’re still waiting for one more.
I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife.
Not tonight—today.
All right, sir, I will.
Is this the work of an ambitious man?
My friends, remember that you’re my guests here.
I’m sure he will stay under control.
Brother Anthony—
My dagger, little nephew?
And what are you going to do with it?
He’s as 
We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely.
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready.
Ha, ha, ha!
There he is!
Away!
The sun will not appear today.
Come here, man.
Richard, the duke of Gloucester, is very dangerous, and the queen’s sons and brothers are haughty and proud—it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects, not rulers.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.
Where’s Antony?
I have to make do.
He’s honest, he’s got to speak the truth.
Don’t say “banishment.” From now on, you are banished from Verona.
I’ll obey you until I can make bail.
So the candle went out and now we’re all in the dark.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand up.
Good night, my lord.
My God, that’s my handkerchief!
And aren’t you a Montague?
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince, who has compromised his honor by making the match, and Claudio, whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who’s pretending to be a virgin.
Come inside with me, and I will tell you my plan.
Come on, boy.  
Where is your husband?
Are you Sebastian?
I look forward to getting to know you better, Mr. Mustardseed.
You know, you’re right.
True.
Here’s some more news coming in.
Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it?
If her eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing, thinking her light was the light of day.
That’s why you sleep so soundly.
I have a lot to do before noon.
Who here is so vile that he doesn’t love his country?
He’s got an answer for everything.
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully.
Let’s not talk about it.
They have to stay there.
No more of these thoughts.
I’m sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
Tell me, what does he think of our situation?
Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced.
Please go inside.
Not me.
He brushes his hat in the mornings.
Nobody delivered it, my lord.
Do you know me?
But it’s dark out, and it could be a trap.
It’s a good tragedy, very well done.
The only thing different about me is my clothes.
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back.    
I’d never play pranks on you.
If you wish.
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s corpse.
Servant monster”?
It was a painful bruise, and she was crying bitterly.
You are very welcome here, sir. 
These are nothing but jealous lies.
I don’t have the cash right now.
Ratcliffe, around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor.
Yes, Cassius.
What’s that noise?
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them.
No, Messala.
But you’re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly, vulgar, and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel.
Like love, my lord, before it learns to love.
Where is my mother?
That way, the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire.
Leave me and do what I told you to do.
When we’re by ourselves you can call me “Tranio.” Everywhere else, address me as your master Lucentio.
He seems cheerful.
Come on, Sir Andrew, there’s nothing you can do about it.
Yes, for three months.
Still, I’d hate to see my former dreams return.
If you’re my friend, you’ll let me see his letter.
Caesar!
My mistress,” I said.
My eyes itch—is that an omen I’ll be crying soon?
A crown was offered to him, and he pushed it away with the back of his hand, like this—and then the people started shouting.
Silly babbler, how you talk!
But I think—I want to tell you the truth, and now that I think about it, I think this is true—I came here with Hermia.
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath?
It’s no use!
No I won’t, even if you were one of the worst demons in hell.
Are you coming again for ransom?
Is that why you’re talking so wildly?
What’s the matter?
Lend me your handkerchief.
The king will already have left Southampton.
Though I have far more reason, I don’t have as much energy to curse you.
I’ll go as fast as I can, madam.
With his ambition growing like this—do you hear what I’m saying?
And this is what you told me he said: that he beat you and pretended his house wasn’t his and I wasn’t his wife.
Are you behind some bush?
Oh yes, sir, I have often been to Pisa—Pisa, City of Wise Men.
The moment they planned to act is almost here.
What’s Pyramus?
Did he get away clean?
What do you think, madam?
But God forgive me for bragging.
What is your wish with regard to her?
What are you thinking about so seriously?
tody of them so I can do what’s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom.
Your eyes look like they’ve sunk into your head.
It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook.
He doesn’t have children.
Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son.
I gave you everything— And it was about time too.
Why, what have you done, sweet Beatrice?
I believe you, and I ask you to forgive me.
Who can stain that name with a just accusation?
You’ll be sick tomorrow because you’ve stayed up all night.
We’re ready if our minds are ready.
We’ll come with you, your Grace.
I am sorry for her, as I should be, since I am both her uncle and her guardian.
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon.
I can read my own fortune in my misery.
Perhaps you’ve learned from life and not from books.
Well, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.
What is it?
Romeo?
But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man.
I assure you, my man is as true as steel.
Jailer, watch out for this one.
Oh, Caesar!
Is there anything else you wish?
You can see for yourself.
Excuse me?  
What shall I do?
It doesn’t get seen enough; you should wear it in your cap, the way fools wear coxcombs.
I’ll make her come right away, I promise you.
You’ll work for me.
Kate, my wooing is fit for your understanding: I am glad your English isn’t better.
When should the three of us meet again?
I hope what she’s saying is well, sir!
Here comes another Jew.
I don’t know what else it could be.
The Turkish navy will be broken up.
But a stronger pity, for the wrongs committed against Rome, drove out our pity for Caesar, as fire drives out fire, and so we killed him.
No words can express the pain.
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you.
And those who leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men though buried in your dunghills—they’ll be remembered, too.
He doesn’t miss a thing.
Please answer, my good little student.
I must go report what happened.
And if you treat us badly, won’t we try to get revenge?
Is that called for in the contract?
You come from heaven, don’t you?
If I’m not dreaming, you are Emilia.
You!
My name is Petruchio, son of Antonio, a man well known throughout Italy.
She’s not going to borrow money from them.
I can be discreet in honorable matters, ride a horse, run, tell a good story badly, and deliver a plain message bluntly.
I hit hard when I’m angry.
Thursday is coming.
As I remember, Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy.
Well, sir, and you, witty lady, who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk, my name is Vincentio, my hometown Pisa, and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven’t seen in a long while.
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds, take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries.
So, I agree with noble Buckingham—only a few should go to meet the prince.
Don’t you think so?
Then the Jew must show you mercy.
You are my guests.
This is the perfect place to rehearse.
Therefore, depart, and leave him here with me.
And then what would I do with him?
Let’s go, because it’s already after midnight, and we want him on our side before daylight.
It’s not daylight.
You and he are both welcome, sir.
If you’re Launcelot, then you’re my own flesh and blood.
The noise they’re making will wake up Demetrius.
Romans, countrymen, and friends!
You have no reason to say that.
What news can you tell me in this fast-moving, unsteady state of ours?
You promised to take a full year off my sentence.
You say you have news that’s old?
You are their heir and sit on their throne, and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins.
Now talk to him in your own voice, and tell me how he is.
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler?
That’s what makes it “sensitive” news.
Well, how nice, a riddle!
It’s partly my own fault, since I followed you here.
They were lusting after each other.
Messala, today is my birthday—I was born on this very day.
Are you talking, you villain?
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning.
Bardolph, be happy.—Nym, rouse your bragging spirits.—Boy, be brave.
I will say as much to his face.
She’s dead, deceased, she’s dead.
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell?
Love’s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters.
Nobody but the fool, who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes.
I sent for you about a sad occasion.
Good idea.
The man’s going crazy.
Didn’t you send Lysander, as an insult, to follow me around praising my eyes and my face?
Be free and happy.
Don’t ask me to talk about it.
Edward Plantagenet, why are you dead?  
What does Romeo say?
You’ve already stained our sheets with your lust; now I’ll stain them with your whore’s blood.
So what do you say to my suit?
Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility.
He’s made me a Christian.
Set him free.
You look like you have something more to say.
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us, we’ll only make the boar angry and suspicious, causing him to chase us when he never intended to.
Shall I put it plainly?
A fox you’ve trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered, If my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them.
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal.
You say the king is losing his mind.
I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before.
Yes.
I am their father’s mother.
You’re a fool.
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
Prepare yourselves, generals.
He does nothing but frown, as if he wants to say, “If you don’t want me, I don’t care.” He doesn’t even smile when he hears funny stories.
But wait a moment.
Otherwise, I’ll die a virgin, devoted to you.
Give me your hand.
No, it heals gradually.
It’s time to reassess the situation.
What a righteous judge!
I think I can guess what you’re about to say.
Do you have the flower?
Young budding virgin, fair and pure and sweet, where are you off to?
As I get to leech him, I will show some mercy.
Didn’t you say something?
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him!
I can’t say “whore.” It makes me sick to say the word even now.
Where?
There’s a feud between the two dukes.
No, no, I’m as ugly as a bear, since animals that see me run away in terror.
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he’s given away.
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping?
Yes, my good lord.
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger.
I swear I’ll smack you if you hit me again.
That’s right.
It’s too bad.
You killed this king, didn’t you?
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have!
What, are you trying to make me crazy?
But now I have joyful news for you, girl.
Read the time there.
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens.
My lord, the mayor of London is here to greet you.
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended.
That’s how flimsy and unreal pleasure is.
Am I your servant?
Listen, please, give me the necklace.
Hello, Cassio!
Ambassadors of Harry, king of England, request a hearing with your Majesty.
Make your confession short.
And they respond to you with their hearts as well.
She is not sick, my lord, but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping.
Everything you told me I already knew.
You have some plea for Caesar, don’t you?
Saint Francis, help me!
Not tonight, Iago.
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses.
If that’s true, then don’t be tongue-tied.
Good to see you, Corporal Nym.
Get out!
I’ve had very little joy as England’s queen.  
Everything’s out of control.
They’re certainly a peaceful couple!
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other, though I have the gift of strength.
My lord, what I say may be a little confused, since I’m half asleep and half awake.
I came from Corinth, Your Highness.
And good ones, too.
He’ll never follow anything that other men have started.
I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like.
If she feels like coming over here, I’ll give her your message.
What’s the obvious conclusion from that?
I wish I could see this invisible drummer.
Myself?
But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony.
Yes, if you want to help yourself.
He’s arrived.
It is, my lord.
Both of which, master constable— You have.
Say, uncle Richard, if my brother comes, where will I stay till my coronation?
I’ve been dishonored: I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore.
When was the last time you saw my father?
What news do you have?
Both?
Good night, good brother.
Oh God!
Yes, that’s true.
If you put me in the stocks you’ll insult him both as a king and as a man.
Where is my page?
That’s worse.
Do I mistreat even my enemies?
Advancement to some scaffold, to lose their heads.
I put my trust in you.
That’s a good thing to put in—it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law.
Yes, that’s me.
My liege, this was my glove.
God, I’m really sick.
Hey, Cassio!
Here’s why: it’d be better for the enemy to come after us.
No, I swear by my life and soul!
Now you’re Romeo.
Duke Solinus, my husband, and both my children—and you two Dromios, who marked the day of my sons' births with your own—come into the abbey with me for a new christening.
I’ll sleep here until morning.
I’ll give you more instructions later.
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up.
I won’t be hit, my lord.  
If you go outside, arm yourself.
I feel sorry for you.
Keep your voice down.
I’m your evil spirit, Brutus.
You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?
She’s not feeling well.
And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right?
You may really be honest, no matter what I think.
Here, take this piece of jewelry.
I did, Malvolio?
If you aren’t weeping, it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have a new father.
My lord, the enemy has already passed the marsh.
My master’s calling me.
Her reputation is also her own.
Have you forgotten all the talks we’ve had together, the vows we made to be like sisters to one another, all the hours we spent together, wishing that we never had to say goodbye—have you forgotten?
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret, Hero’s servant woman, likes me.
Yes, if you kept them together and invested them.
I must be as stupid as an ass—that’s why I don’t know her, but she knows me.
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen over myself.
Not explicitly, but so what?
I leave a slimy bastard with you, your Worship, for you to punish and make an example of.
How is my generous sister?
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it, and deserved it too.
Then no man has ever been honest.
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard, who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him.
Go, then, mother, to your daughter.
Let that be enough for you.
Great Duke, be merciful to mortal men.
They haven’t been commanded to go to the west, mighty king.
I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically.
That was too much.
I have a bad cold that’s bothering me.
This is a nasty night to go swimming.
I repeat, he’s in love.
I just know I’m not one.
Here’s a sick man who wants to speak with you.
Though I am not a flattering, righteous man, at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain.
It’s only just now nine o'clock.
Yes, I think that’s true.
Richard.
Isn’t this Stephano, my drunken butler?
What, you’re not a whore?
The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions.
We 
No, I found it and gave it to my husband.
That day will never come.
Go, bring him here, boy.
For when you cut your shin.
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—Gentlemen, are you good Christians, and do you serve God?
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio.
We are, my lord.
Now I’ve done a good day’s work.
It’s really the only way, Sir Andrew.
Who’s sounding that alarm?
Oh, I can buy twenty husbands at any market.
Yes, leave that labor to great Hercules—it’s worse than the previous twelve put together.  
From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment.
And when will that be?
It’s time to hide, wretched Margaret.
Didn’t they pass by you?
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief.
My situation is desperate.
Yes, my lord, if you would like.
Are you satisfied, Jew?
If you refuse it, the whole country will regret it.
I’m only trying to keep the peace.
I’m in a rush.
If not, he’s got truth on his side!
How horrible!
God bless your Grace!
I’ll 
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions.
They would like me to be as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs, which goes against my manhood, because to take something from another’s pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing.
It’s late.
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house, to use as bait to catch these thieves.
How is she?
Oh, Cassius, Brutus gave the orders too soon.
As dumb as dirt!
You don’t know how to pick a man.
I’m sure you know him.
I can’t blame her.
You know where I’ll be waiting.  
I’m indebted to you forever.
Wipe your eyes.
Come on—kill me and brag about it!
Yes, my lord?
Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment again.
It’s a friend of Antony’s.  
He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis.
Look, your wife is with him.
But once he got there, the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola.
Follow your spirit, and as you charge cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”
Who’s dead?
I can’t figure it out by myself!
I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling queen.
It is, my lord.
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman.
Oh, there’s the problem.
So be it.
If it’s possible to do this without putting yourself in danger, dear Captain Blunt, say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note.
Shall I be your slave?
God should keep me from false friends, but they weren’t false.
That’s for to me to decide.
With that, I’ll be off.
I don’t have it with me.
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out, “Liberty, freedom, and democracy!” People and senators, don’t be afraid.
I’d be as right for the job as you are, and I’d do it more easily, since I’d have good will on my side.
Come on, put it away.
Oh, my heart, my heart is rising into my throat!
My stupid heart, which I’m leaving behind here.
Very nice to see you, sir.
You’re less happy, being feared, than they are in fearing you.
A deed that will make sick men healthy.
Mine did too.
You want proof?
Oh, so cruel!
I can’t do this.
When I first heard about him, he was still a bachelor.
Here’s the hut, my lord.
Who comes with him?
That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one.
Let’s be light-hearted.
I beg your pardon, sir— What did that guy say?
You can ride him easily, and he responds well when you pull the reins.
I saw Bassanio sail away, and Gratiano went with him.
This looks like an abbey.
I have time for you now, my sad daughter.
No, good goose, don’t bite me.
Take these too.
Happy with Hermia?
Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it.
The skin is good for your cracked head.
Arm yourself.
Dear woman, you don’t know the rules of charity.
Just a moment.
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman!
Tie up the servant, for he is mad as well.
Lay out the gown.
Make room for Antony, most noble Antony!
That’s how things should be—straight and smooth.
Send for the Count.
Statilius waved the torchlight at us, but he hasn’t come back.
Make these men work.
The sweet fool in a fool’s costume—that’s me.
Good morning to both of you.
But their trick failed.
Is this the Prince?
Give me one kiss, and I’ll go down.
Why?
Sir Paris, I’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love.
A drum!
Isn’t today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry Demetrius?
Madam!
If you hadn’t been their father, your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion.
I’m not really Litio.
Why are you talking like that?
But I’m old now, and suffering has weakened me.
Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end.
Let’s not get gloomy in our reminiscing, since there’s no reason for sadness anymore.
Please, sir, hurry up.
Hey!
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril—both of them sour crabapples.
What’s done is done.
Are you squinting at me?
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for.—Get out of my sight, scoundrel!
I’m afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.
There!… And over there!… And over there!
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before.
If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star.
Whom did he leave in charge here?
Whip me, you devils, so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight!
That’s very likely.
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy.
And to you, good sir.
I’m finished, then.
Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home?
Now, don’t forget, you promised me something.
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply.
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter.
So, by Christ, I’ll cut off your head.
Well, that’s what you get to do.
He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs.
If you regard it as shameful, put the shame on me.
Live, live!
Be sure to burn his magic books.
I’ll look into it further.
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you.
Don’t go near Casca.
God bless you, Mr.
Knock, knock, knock!
Get him to say his prayers, Sir Toby, get him to pray.
No, please, I beg your Majesty.
Oh friendly friar!
Come on, Desdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you, to tell you what you need to do.
My dear Portia, if you knew who I gave the ring to, for whose sake I gave the ring to him, why I gave it to him, and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t accept anything but the ring, you wouldn’t be so angry.
You think you can get rid of me that easily?
Such a kind father!—Are my horses ready?
Stand and fight, you overdressed servant, fight!
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little.
Yes, I’ve been responsible for his upbringing.
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel, but that’s just engraved on the surface.
Eighty ducats!
You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy.
Be patient, because the prize I’m leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now.
And he challenged you to a duel?
So Litio’s out of the picture.
Hello, spirit!
The death of my father, my physical weakness, the loss of all my friends, the threats of this man who’s taken me prisoner—all that would be easy for me to take, if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl.
Madam, we have to go: the Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church.
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding.
Come break this up, Benvolio.
My lord, I will help you, even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight.
Get some light!
Now I have to leave.
And everyone can say “welcome,” which is just a word.
Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change!
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me.
Didn’t you hear someone shouting?
There is a river in Macedon, and there is likewise a river in Monmouth.
It would’ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did.
You’re all lazy and shallow.
It’s my master who’s not getting the reward he deserves, not me.
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
If it turns out he wasn’t, certain people are going to get it.
When did you become so fond of singing, boy?
How can that be?
How did you like the young German, the duke of Saxony’s nephew?
Is that the naked guy?
But he isn’t here now.
Mantua.
Give it to my wife, and get your money.
And, just in time, here comes the sweaty lord.
Please smile whenever you’re near me, my dearest darling.”
Performing is activity, and he is always doing that.
She cursed Hastings then.
What are you saying?
Why, do you know of any harm intended toward him?
What’s going on, Malvolio?
The woman I love is beautiful.
Wake up, wake up!
We’re in God’s hands, brother, not in theirs.
He would have?
It’s almost morning.
But why aren’t you in your shop today?
My husband lost his life to get the crown, and my sons' fortunes have been tossed up and down, leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses.
So the lion disappeared.
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king.
Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power.
All right, my lord.—How’s the king doing?
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen.
Isn’t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife?
Doesn’t my wit suit me well?
And I’m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little, I need to scratch.
Demetrius is an admirable man.
I don’t have any news to report, my lord.
Let go of me!
Change into better clothes.
Has Fortune turned on me, like the whore she is?
To hell with all worn-out horses, all crazy masters, and all bad roads.
Love each other and be friends, like two such men should be.
Please come closer.— Make the music louder, please!
There was no need to tell me to get out of there.
Come here, Sir Andrew.
I swear, I love you.
Okay, bring on the play.
He’s a conspirator.
Do you have your answer yet?
Oh, yes, Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever.  
My God, who knows?
Yes, why not, my lord?
Sure, to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest.
The duke of Gloucester, who has command over the siege, is in consultation with an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman indeed.
If I remember correctly, I can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately.
Because, if you must know, she’s been chosen by Signior Gremio.
Are you going to watch the race?
I wish some god could help me choose!
In short, when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan, he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body, cutting my arm.
Forgotten you!
Tell him I’m sick.
Shall I accompany your Grace?
Captain Macmorris, if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant, see, I’ll have to think you’re not treating me with the good will you ought to, see, since I am as good a man as yourself, both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects.
Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him.
I want to avoid that.
No, you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation, quiet and pleasant.
The door is open, sir.
Yet I wish I could.
They swore you did.
But you’ll have to catch me!
down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this.
I’ll bury you in a magnificent grave.
If she sends any letters to Richmond, you will be accountable to me for it.
What, faithful to being mean and nasty?
And though I wouldn’t dare to swear that you love me, still my blood begins to flatter me that you do, despite the ill effects of my face.
I was told that by one who knows him better than you.
Ah, he got you back, Benedick!
Who is this bloody man?
That’s why I’m worried about you.
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king’s crown three times, and he refused it three times.
Go find the traitor Gloucester.
I am the son of Marcus Cato!
What do you want from me, my good man?
Welcome, my lord.
Varrus and Claudio!
What should we do about that?
Shylock, although I never lend or borrow with interest, I’m willing to break that habit to help a friend in need.
I’m backed into a corner with nowhere to run.
Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next.
First let me talk with this philosopher here.—
But wait, there’s some prose after her poem.
He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos.
Wear both the ring and my heart, because both are yours.
Do your job.
You are welcome here, as are all of you English princes.
What do you want to say, sir?
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true.
Be kind and polite to this gentleman.
Whenever you’re ready, hostess.
But I must go there, against my will: servants must fulfill their masters' wishes.
The law has another hold on you.
I’m not like that now.
But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth.
Has he taken care of the music?
I admit two sleeves.
You can have anything you want.
I’m doing so.
Who’s that?
I know the real reason.
Yes, I’m sure he will—to stay with you.
You are right, it’s for my mistress.
Noble Buckingham, your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart.
They’re looking for you in the great chamber.
Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless).
You need to learn what ants know well about winter—there’s no point in slaving away if there’s no hope for profit.
Up here you can’t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks.
Should we go see the sights in the town?
I’m your advocate, and I’d rather die than give up on you.
I won’t sleep until I’ve delivered your letter, my lord.
Here, you there, Grumio.
Isn’t that what he said?
When they feared death, they escaped with their lives; and now where they imagine they’re safe, they perish.
How can I marry him, this husband, before he comes to court me?
I’ll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart.
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately?
I had a round with him, and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can’t even duck out of the way.
Who, me?
We’ll meet at the Elephant.
I beg you, Strato, stay by me.
No more than twenty-five.
Maybe she’s just pretending.
He liked to call me a loan shark; let him think about his debt to me.
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me, for if her hunger is satisfied, she’ll pay no attention to the bait.
Come, trusty sword.
And yet I wouldn’t want to be you, uncle.
Yes, and that’s a serious failing.
I won’t break this promise.
It’s pretty well done, isn’t it?
Today, great duke, she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores.
If I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying.
Have you heard anything to the contrary?
Is that the law?
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island.
I certainly will, sir.
She’s talking, but she’s not saying anything.
Get out of my sight.
No, the legs and thighs.
Lord, Lord, when she was a little baby—Oh, there is one nobleman in the city, a guy named Paris, who would be happy to claim her as his own.
You represented yourself as just a common man.
We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus!
There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again.
It might happen that these strange signs, the unusual terror of this night, and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today.
Do you recognize my voice, noble lord?
What’s the matter?
Come, Grey.
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend?
Defend yourself!
I have a  That’s from lack of sleep.
You’re mistaken.
But Angelo, you’ll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop.
When I reach the place he’s calling from, he disappears.
The Dauphin, whom we asked for reinforcements, sends back the answer that he’s not yet in a position to raise so great an army.
They’ll be here tomorrow or the next day.
I’m going to find out what you’re thinking.
There’s no other shelter around here.
I have a list of all the important men.
Authority.
You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade.
Master, master, I’ve been on the lookout so long, I’m ready to fall down dead—but I’ve got one, finally!
He does, and now he’s taking revenge on you—for breaking promises and for murder, too.
We grew together like twin cherries—which seemed to be separate but were also together—two lovely cherries on one stem. 
Snip and snip and cut and slash—it’s got more holes than a sieve!
Go, go, good countrymen, and to make up for having done wrong, gather up all the poor men like yourselves, lead them to the Tiber, and weep into the river until it overflows its banks.
That’s not good.
What, I’m a prisoner?
I’m strong-willed.
What are you thinking?
He wants me dead.
Captain Macmorris, I think, see—correct me if I’m wrong—there are not many of your nation— My nation?
Now that’s patience!
I see you’re all eaten up with emotion.
Some of you go to Decius’s house and some to Casca’s.
Well, I’ll go to Scone.
Hurry up, Robin, and make the night dark and cloudy.
Sir, it’s the Moor.
I’d wager twenty times as much on my wife.
What’s your name, friend?
What, you’re leaving it with Lysander?
Then don’t make yourself too conspicuous.
You evil whore!
If not, come when you have the courage.
Maybe it’s a parade to welcome us to town, master.
If they do this, as they will, God willing, my ransom will soon be raised.
Caesar, you’re not going to be killed by a traitor—unless you kill yourself..
He’s definitely drunk now.
Good Macbeth, we’re ready when you are.
I’ve been transformed somehow, haven’t I, master?
Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief!
What soldiers, fool?
Girls, girls!
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her, kinsman, and that’s good English.
If you get what you want and you’re still not happy, you’ve spent everything and gained nothing.
Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven.
And if he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven.
I’ll go to him.
I was wrong to her— Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?
Who was that?
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you, and I’ll do what he says.
I don’t know who had him arrested, but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather.
Draw your sword, scoundrel.
Ensign, what’s he doing in there?
I love him even when he’s harsh and mean—Help me unpin this, would you?—I love even his stubbornness, his frowns, his bad moods.
If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you, as there’s a risk that you might have a relapse.
We don’t intend any harm to you, nor to anyone else.
Words before fighting.
Hurry up, my Jewish friend.
One?
You’re so attractive when you smile.
What can I do for you, sir?
Hush, Hortensio.
Why did you do that?
Sing my praises to your mistress.
Start a fight?
Come with me, and let’s smother my fiendish son—who smothered your two sweet sons—in bitter words.
Believe me, I’ll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side.
It’s a nice hazy feeling, so give in to it.
How dare I?
I wouldn’t have dared!
You killed my child.
That was good planning, and you’ll sleep some more.
Now, my sweet lord, you know how much I like you.
It will rain tonight.
I’ll do it.
They’re natural enough.” I think these things are omens of things to come in our country.
It’s time to leave.
You’ve already done something you should be sorry for.
They’re well too.
Laugh at the power of other men, because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth.  
Antony’s eyes are fiery red from crying.
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm.
Very well.
I know that young men look forward to their rest.
Malvolio, your vanity is damaging your good taste.
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal, I had tears in my eyes—but they were tears of laughter.
Go on, go on.
And so farewell.
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.
I could take back my crown by force—What outrageous ingratitude!
If you could, you couldn’t bring him back to life.
Oh Scotland, Scotland!
A sleeve?
For the love of God, call a doctor!
Come, my sweet Kate.
Watch out!
My master’s decision.
Damn you all!
Hurry, hurry, close the curtain quick.
Harry le Roy.
I hope you haven’t lost your mind.
I am being serious, my lord.
I can’t believe that.
Put the torch out, so I can’t be seen.
What’s up, Grumio?
I’m crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I’m dying to have.
Take her to my tent.
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else, because there was no one else to witness her speech.
May God choose you to receive his grace.
There’s no scarier wild bird than the living lion, and we should remember that.
Yes, absolutely, no question or ambiguity about it.
Go with my brothers to my English peers.
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus.
My Lord of Norfolk— Here, most gracious king.
I hear what they say about him for doing that.
Be quiet and depart.
Tell her that I, her king, am her lowly subject.
Come on, you’re fooling yourself.
Tut, tut, my lord, we’re not going to stand around chit-chatting.
Don’t worry.
Yes, God be praised, I have managed to earn his favor.
Then it’s confirmed!
But I will go out, for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me.
Bring me to my host, Macbeth.
I’m going to take it from you now.
If she’s lying, I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day.
Oh, life is full of surprises!
Ah, here comes my messenger.—What’s going on, you crazy spirit?
He’s pretty awful in the morning when he’s sobering up, and even worse in the afternoon when he’s drunk.
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt.
Does anyone here know who I am?
Niece, will you take care of those things I mentioned?
Won’t the dawn come from here?
Benvolio, who started this fight?
Wait.
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved, with her children dead before their time.
I’ll be vain and proud, I’ll read up on politics, I’ll insult Sir Toby, I’ll get rid of my lower-class friends, and I’ll be the perfect man for her.
On that point, our letters don’t agree.
And is “pig” not the same as “great,” may I ask?
Now is the time when we need your help.
What soldiers, milk-face?
It’s even stranger when an angel is so angry.
Soldiers, sir.
That will tell you a lot.
What’s going on here, general?
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it’s gotten rolling?
So then, you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded.
As I was working on one musty room, the Prince and Claudio entered.
But please, forgive me, your highness.
How strange that they all got so sleepy!
I don’t want anything more.
Yes, and it seemed twice as long to me, having been kept from your bed that whole time.
How strange I’m feeling!
We will go in together.
He wouldn’t say that.
