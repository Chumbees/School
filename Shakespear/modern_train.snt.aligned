You do their work for them and give them good luck.
Come with me tonight, and you’ll see a man enter her bedroom chamber—even tonight, the night before her wedding.
Yes, he was born at Monmouth, Captain Gower.
I know my rights.
Here it is.
Well, onward, then.
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you—girls from noble families—who have already become mothers.
Get up.
You have so much natural talent, but like someone who hoards money, you use none of your talent for the right purpose—not your body, not your love, not your mind.
Don’t bother with it.
All traitors protest like this.
I’ll give it a try.
May they relieve a sick old man’s suffering.
What is your name?
But I won’t attack a woman, even if she is a demon.
Lucius!
Follow me.
Authority.
Is that really what you meant?
Quiet!
Your wit is so forceful, it frightens the very meaning out of your words.
We’ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke’s forest.
Consider it done, my lord.
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind.
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there.
What’s the matter?
So you’ll be hanged at the state’s expense.
What an annoying man, this guy is!
But it’s enough.
And why do you blame me for loving you?
His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink.
Come on, men!
I have no doubt he got ashore alive.
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield.
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it, if you’re willing.
Caesar, the clock has struck eight.
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird’s nest and happily shows it to his friend, who then steals it from him.
In the meantime, hold on, and be patient.
I hear a noise inside.
Some to Ligarius’s.
Go to sleep, and I will wrap my arms around you.
One face, one voice, one way of dressing, but two people!
Doesn’t a Jew eat the same food, get hurt with the same weapons, get sick with the same diseases, get healed by the same medicine, and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian?
Oh, God!
Ratcliffe!
I never felt it until now—two thousand ducats in that diamond, and other precious, precious jewels!
Oh Portia, these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper.
I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave.
That’s why I’m worried about you.
Goodbye, Goodbye!
This clearing will be the stage, and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room.
Cassius, what a night this is!
Tell him, if he comes here, I’ll explain everything to him and, on my word, he’ll leave unharmed.
But give words a chance.
No, Messala.
They say the horses ate each other.
I’ve told you.
I hope things go well there.
My love, call him back in here.
Are you speaking from your heart?
We human beings don’t control our own destinies.
You stupid cop, stop your violence!
Don’t be late.
That’s three hours since nine o'clock, but she hasn’t come back.
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin’s death except me!
Isn’t this war against me?
Look!
These are frightening odds.
You’re as wise as you are beautiful.
Tell him I’ll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy’s Day and slap his head with it.
If you sink, you’re dragging love down.
Oh, my daughter!
I’ll hide in the arbor.
Come on, you’re drunk.
Farewell, brother.
I do, and it sounds like you’re talking in your sleep.
Choose another tack.
It’s someone with a torch!
So I’ll be forced to call you a jerk, Sir Andrew.
If you interrupt it, he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy.
You’ll wear a mask, and you can make your voice as high as you want to.
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away.
Why Dover?
Trinculo, watch out.
Bring him in front of me.
Don’t delay.
Thank you.
Be quiet, you are Antonio.
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own.
Oh, you’re sticking a dagger in me!
Titinius, if you love me, get on your horse and spur him on until he’s brought you to those troops and back again, so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies.
No, my lord.
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court.
But I can’t help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said, “Yes.” I swear, she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster’s testicle.
Killing men in the dark?
I’ll never see it.
But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage, and so should you.
Now leave me alone, as I said.
One of you go find the forest ranger.
Have I accomplished so much in battle, but now I’m afraid to tell some old men the truth?
Yes, I am.
Thank you.
I brought you here from Venice.
I want to learn how to lie.
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick, whom she has always appeared to hate.
is yours.” And, though I say so in his presence, if he’s not a friend of the best kings, you’ll find him king of the best friends.
Some of you go to Decius’s house and some to Casca’s.
Is that possible?
Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness.
I stand here with the law on my side.
Lysander, keep your Hermia.
Which of you does not tremble when you see me?
But let it go.—Now, Litio, it’s your turn.
I’ll do that.    
It’s gone.
Is there more news?
Come, blade, drench my breast with blood.
Goodbye.
Tomorrow, Caesar, I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war.
I’ll make you sing.
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye!
I’d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse.
Don’t joke about his predictions.
Has she told Benedick how she feels?
You’ve forgotten the will I told you about.
I’ve never seen such a monster.
Nor living ones, I hope.
Clarence has arrived—lying, cowardly  I’m not surprised it scared you, my lord.
I’m telling you to make a fist and pound.
I swam ashore like a duck.
Wretched boy, you hung out with him here, and you’re going to go to heaven with him.
Is that true?
I don’t want her.
Is this face Hero’s?
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer, noble father-in-law.
Gold, silver, and common lead.
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway.
Oh, Antony, don’t beg us to kill you.
I will, madam.
I say you’re not.
We didn’t please them on land.
Yes, why shouldn’t she?
I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that, and I won’t believe it from you.
Listen to Antony.
Let’s carry him to the barracks.
Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex.
What’s this?
You won’t be wasting your time, because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music, so he’ll be happy to have me in his service.
What, am I being denied death, as well?
Come, sweet nymphs, and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers.
Oh, what a wonderful son, I can impress my mother!
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean. 
I know exactly how to proceed.
Shut up, fool!
Why are you so far from home?
To find you.
The enemy approaches with great display.
Even if I have to die—as they threaten—I have to help the king.
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too.
So please rest.
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane, I won’t be affected by fear.
I’ll do it.
Why, the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death.
Brutus killed me.
Madam wife, they say I’ve been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years.
This was the most unkind cut of all.
No, I swear it.
Who is her mother?
Give me that letter, sir.
But now I have joyful news for you, girl.
Some people kiss shadows.
He’s not your man.
Quiet!
Who are the new commissioners?
Oh, finish what I’ve begun.
Little pitchers have big ears.
Look!
What, my dear lord?
You’re afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear?
If only all struggles ended this well.
That’s the one, sir.
Here was a Caesar!
Well, well, well.
Why, our troops amount to three times that.
Greetings, dearest Caesar!
I remember your eyes quite well.
All right, I’ll stop.
Indeed, I would have such an exploit for you, Ligarius, if you were healthy enough to hear it.
We’d find that he was a dangerous plotter.
Which is either a fool or a nothing.
In that case, he’s more obliged to you than I am.
He intends to do something bad to you.
He’s not here.
Men’s eyes were made to see things, so let them watch.
If you take it too seriously, it’ll have bad effects that I didn’t want it to have.
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along.
Besides, how have I offended you, my friends?
Use your clubs and spears!
Go get my best clothes.
You’re mistaken.
If your Majesties recall it, the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which, your Majesty knows, is to this day a badge of honorable military service.
Her grapes, which make the wine that cheers our hearts, die unpruned on the vines.
If you’re calling me Jephthah, my lord, I do have a daughter I love more than anything, yes.
I will, sir.
I have already condemned and excused myself.
Hang on a second.
Call Claudio and some of my other men.
You sent me to the port to find a ship.
Nothing.
Or are you just pretending?
Captain Fluellen!
You’re a natural-born philosopher!
Oh, what an excellent thing this learning is!
I’m going to the Friar to find out his solution.
I’ll do it.
Our land forces have bravely stood firm.
Sir, I make my living using an awl.
There’s no other shelter around here.
You’re so much older than you look!
Hot, hot and moist.
To the breach, to the breach!
But I think—I want to tell you the truth, and now that I think about it, I think this is true—I came here with Hermia.
But before we reached the end point, Caesar cried, “Help me, Cassius, or I will sink!” And just as Aeneas, the hero who founded Rome, emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder, so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar.
We have to give up and let him go.      
God bless you!
Yes, I’ll go.
Well, your imprisonment won’t last long.
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know, and who doesn’t know you!
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath?
His cowardly lips turned white, and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam.
First, he said you had no right to him.
Those tears will bring blessings to you.
Come with us to Athens.
But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him.
I’ll tear her to pieces!
Bring me the handkerchief—My mind is full of doubt.
Your majesty!
His drugs work quickly.
Come here, Ventidius.
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message.
These times of pain are bad times for romance.
Oh, honey!
What do you want with me?
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does.
Oh, that’s nothing, believe me, sir.
But I’ve been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list, and I can’t read!
About the table, sir, dinner will be served on it.
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples, Gonzalo, had given us out of the kindness of his heart.
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this, madam?
What did he say?
As freely, son, as God gave her to me.
Yes.
Right, and they wore proclamations around their necks, saying, “Be it known to all men by these  The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler.
May you die of the worst disease!
But gilded tombs contain worms.
Hang on a minute, here’s some money for you.
She lied to me, and she may lie to you.
No doubt it will, my liege, if each man does his best.
I’ll send my eyes to prison, and they’ll never be free to look at anything again.
Are you beautiful?
You left him out in the storm in the black night, bareheaded, a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea, the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars.
Haven’t you made your other love, Demetrius—who kicked me with his foot not long ago—call me a goddess and a divine, rare, precious, heavenly creature?
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason.
I should backtrack and begin with how my master, Don John, arranged for the Prince, Claudio, and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard.
Spirit, we have to get ready to meet with Caliban.
Yes, a little too sweet.
Yes, Cassius.
Don’t you know he has?
I’m putting myself in God’s hands, and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder.
My first question for Nerissa is whether she’d rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now, since there are only two more hours till morning.
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction, see, of my mind, with respect to the demands of proper military practice—that’s the point?
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us, we’ll only make the boar angry and suspicious, causing him to chase us when he never intended to.
And I think that if I hadn’t been brave and strong, she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave.
Don’t be afraid of her company.
Of course, sir.
He is in heaven, where you will never go.
When I work it over with magic spells, the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions.
There’s no clock here in the forest.
Once again you bring good news.
Hello, you idiot.
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you, fire up your passions, and make you angry and jealous.
Sir, he told me quite bluntly that he didn’t feel like it.
We just want you to answer to your real name.
Very clever!
Attack the breach in the city wall once more, dear friends, attack it once more—or else let’s close it up with English corpses.
What, you don’t want me to be chaste?
You need not kneel to me.
I’m happy to meet you, my lady and my wife.
From their saddles into the dirt—but that’s another story.
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can’t stand?
I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger.
Come on then.
If you work for him, you’re a fool and should wear a fool’s cap.—So how’s it going, uncle?
I myself am playing the man in the moon— Well then, that’s the biggest mistake of all.
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying.
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles?
Humble as I am, I represent Antony.
If he’s reluctant, I can convince him.
You speak well.
I didn’t hear it.
Since I was three years old, I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician—no black magic here.
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity—therefore, sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs.
Should I blab to her that you’re coming?
We have feelings.
Don’t ask to see this letter.
And I love Hastings with all my heart.
I’ll do the best I can, my lord.
His crime did justice’s job by taking Tybalt’s life.
I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus.
How foolish your fears seem now, Calphurnia!
Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest.
What have you done?
But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough.
You’ll be sick tomorrow because you’ve stayed up all night.
It’s your job in life to kill the innocent?
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
You truly did.
He was on his way here with your wife.
Why not?
Lord, what fools these mortals are!
I haven’t seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
I’ll speak to him now.
Everything except something to live on.
I’m determined to be heard by someone.
Soon all my work will be done, and you’ll be free.
What a lying, drunken monster.
Then you can hear my news, as dessert.
He has a father, and yet he is fatherless.
Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep.
Oh Banquo, Banquo, the king has been murdered!
But do this: find your brother, wherever he is.
We’ve got some words of wisdom to mull over.
His name is Balthazar.
Nothing, sir, except grandchildren.
Your descendants will be kings, even though you will not be one.
No one’s heard from him.
Come on, close the curtain, Nerissa.
I’ll be no king of England if I’m not also king of France.
Do you smell something naughty?
But don’t kill my sister and her royal sons, be satisfied, dear God, with our blood, which is being spilled unjustly, as you know.
I’ve almost missed the time he requested.
They are my daylight, my life.
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions.
Don’t talk back to me.
I will proclaim my name around the field.
As for his cowardliness, ask Fabian.
But who cares.
If we crown him, I have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage.
I know him well by reputation.
There’s my hat!
Oh, liars can look so honest!
Take good care of him.
Good Metellus, go to him now.
But can I have some hope?
I’m not really Litio.
Please let me know your plan, Bassanio.
Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter?
Where?
Let’s assume that she has a reason, which you don’t know yet: have faith that she’ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today.
Father, could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man?
I won’t deny you anything!
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
For the same thing.
Forget about him, Jack!
Certainly.
My name’s Roderigo.
Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now.
If he becomes pale, I know what to do.
She’ll have to have it.
I’m never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music.
I’ll get her, but I won’t keep her long.
So then, you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded.
I’m full of joy.
Right now, my pressing business calls me away.
Aren’t you my father?
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good, and that the mustard on top of them—he swore on his honor—was bad.
I am Benedick.
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible.
Let me love him because he deserves it, and you can love him because I do.
If he breaks the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.
Tear him to pieces.
The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth.
Then you might as well say they’re not dead.
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave.
She’s the reason I’m here.
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them!
I can put him in the right mood, and I’ll bring him to the Capitol.
Your eyes look like they’ve sunk into your head.
My master said it.
The stuff you had at the Centaur, sir.
Well, then it will be dry.
He said he was going to buy me a necklace, but I never saw it.
It’s too frightened to look at itself.
No, not a sad song.
Here I am, Theseus.
Afraid that your anger would not subside, she sent you word she was dead.
The general and his wife are talking about it now, and she’s defending you strongly.
Think about it.
Dear Bassanio, my ships have all been wrecked.
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel.
I’ve never known any woman or seen a woman’s face—except my own in the mirror.
I’ll follow you.
Good luck.
I must go attend Caesar.
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers, just like unicorns can be captured in trees, elephants in holes, and lions with nets.
But your words are as sweet as honey—you’ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing.
Let’s follow them to see how this turns out.
Gentlemen, I don’t know what you intend to do, who else you intend to kill, who else you consider corrupt.
Oh, please be quiet.
Yes, let’s go to sleep.
His breath stinks.
And did you leave him like this?
Hamlet, you’re dead.
Why, what did he do?
Right now; as fast as she can say the vows.
I beg you, remember the good work I’ve done for you, and how I’ve never lied to you, never made mistakes, and never grumbled in my work.
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew.
Why not?
It’s the last command I shall ever give you.
You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife.
So, by heaven’s decree, Rosalind Was composed Of different faces, eyes, and hearts, so that she might have the most prized touches of all.
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides.
No, he was wicked and vile.
Should I get your nightgown?
I accept with thanks, Enobarbus.
So submit to my mercy or, like men who revel in their own destruction, challenge me to do my worst.
Men can be masters of their fate.
My dear lady— Please let me say something, I’m begging you.
Oh, really?
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else, because there was no one else to witness her speech.
Before you got so angry, I never would have thought that.
No, come to my cabin.
I have lived long enough.
I will see them.
Honestly, you’re speaking the truth—ever since the fools were  With his mouth full of news.
I played Julius Caesar.
So, where’s my wife?
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now.
I’d like to sing my song solo.
You can’t mean what you’re saying.
You both know Banquo was your enemy.
Is this possible, my lord?
Where are you, Pindarus?
Take my hand, Hastings.
Good-bye, my lord.
Your grace, the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready.
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise, I guess.
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths, I wouldn’t be able to answer that.
I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now.
He’ll wake you up, I bet.
Will it be tonight at supper?
How is my lord?
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him, and get him back to Naples, he’d make a great present for any emperor.
I’ll meet all your attacks, even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop.
You see me here, gods, a grieving old man, as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age.
Can your man keep a secret?
I’ll be vain and proud, I’ll read up on politics, I’ll insult Sir Toby, I’ll get rid of my lower-class friends, and I’ll be the perfect man for her.
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right, deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him.
What do you say now?
With all my heart, I’ll go right away.
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property, I’m happy, as long as he lets me have the other half in trust, to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter.
My name’s Stephano, and I’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise.
I’ll recite a prophecy before I go.
Come on, niece, I’m sure you love him.
I am a man again.
No one.
You have to come with me.
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us.
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis, and Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife where he was shipwrecked; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves.
You should know that I think you’re a smart man.
He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb.
Damn it!
The wind you’re talking about is blowing us off our course.
Choose your revenge.
We can’t think that way about what we did.
I’ll humor him when he learns how to behave.
I swear by the mass, before I close my eyes to go to sleep, I’ll put in some good fighting, or I’ll lie in the ground dead.
Indeed, my child, at Saint Peter’s Church early Thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride.
She’s round, like a globe.
As they pass by, grab Casca by the sleeve, and he’ll tell you if anything important happened today—in his usual sour way.
Run, my lord, run.
What’s up, daughter and niece?
Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend.
Neighbors, hello.
We’ll probably witness many more outbursts from him, like banishing Kent.
No, my lord, that was me.
Let George Stanley die after the battle.
Great kings of France and England, I owe you both equal service and loyalty.
You can have what you want.
Good Lord!
May God keep you well, sir.
What, aren’t you a Christian?
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed?
But gentle heavens, don’t keep me waiting.
I’m begging you, tell me who it is quickly, and speak fast.
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy, then be happy, because I did it.
But please, forgive me, your highness.
But if you believe everything they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do.
Check the calendar and come tell me.
In Algiers, sir.
I know you know something— Thanks for the compliment, I’m happy you know that.
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat.
He begs you to spare his life.
If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this?
My God, do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe?
Why, mistress, my master is as angry as a bull with horns.
As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.
After you, my lords?
Cicero, I’ve seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees, and I’ve seen the ocean swell, rage, and foam, as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds, but never before tonight, never until now, have I experienced a storm that drops fire.
And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point.
They’ve turned me into food for worms.
Hurry.
Doesn’t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent?
Oh, I’m sure you don’t dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone, even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel.
Caesar and he are better friends than ever.
By this sword, I’ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust.
I will leave here for Verona tonight.
How late is it, lords?
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril—both of them sour crabapples.
My master and my lord!
The priest is already there.
It’s true, my lords, he did.
He’s going senile.
You can’t go any further with us, sir.
Really, Audrey, I wish you were more poetical.
First you taught me how to beg, and now I think you’re teaching me how a beggar should be answered.
Oh Iago!
A good name.
I knew that would be your answer.
When a majestic king starts acting silly, then it’s my duty to be blunt.
Her blood has stopped, and her joints are stiff.
She has the patience of a  I’ll see you hanged on Sunday first!
So this letter, which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant, isn’t going to scare him at all.
Here comes one of them now.
I’m all right.
Just send him here, and I’ll persuade him.
If it pleases you, your highness, will you lead us all inside?
But now I see our weapons are like straws, our strength like a straw’s weakness, and our weakness past comparison, so that we seem to be the thing we most are not.
I won’t.
The son ran away.
I’ll prove that I’m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself.
If that’s what you mean, I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words.
That with a series of legal writs, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death.
I think so too.
lain.
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated.
Why, then, it’s time to put on my armor and instruct the troops. 
By God, I’ll go after him again and beat him up.
Isn’t that what they said?
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos, in a carriage pulled by doves.
What do you think of this fool, Malvolio?
You say you’re a better soldier.
Yes, if the devil tempts you to do good.
He ran to his house, stunned.
If he agrees, great.
Pile of dirt!
My master’s calling me.
Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while.
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible, challenging every enemy he sees.
I have a lot to do before noon.
Still, I’d hate to see my former dreams return.
So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise.
I won’t take it back.
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don’t drown yourself!
Good morning, neighbor Baptista.
What was the last cry for?
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming.
All to our advantage.
Speak, nephew.
Ensign, what’s he doing in there?
I don’t care what he told you in Latin.
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto.
Consider how poorly this reflects on me.
I’ll call for you soon.
Look, sir—here it comes!
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea, and my love is as deep.
And if you’re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be, that’ll be good.
First let me talk with this philosopher here.—
No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point.
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden, but the Adam from the jailhouse.
Give me that pickax and the crowbar.
I think we’ll have to leave out all the killing, come to think of it.
But not in heaven.
Read the will.
You’ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government.—Okay, take him away.
So here’s the plan.
Nobody I care about more than myself.
You always loved to tell me I couldn’t do anything without being told.
He’ll be done in time.
Seriously, though, son Petruchio, I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all.
Or stole it, rather.
This forest doesn’t seem deserted when you’re here, because you are all the world to me.
Next thing you know, he’ll be saying “widower Aeneas.” “Widow Dido,” did you say?
And they respond to you with their hearts as well.
You agree now that we’re not imagining this, don’t you?
I will not live to hear the news from England.
I wish them all safe trips home.
The wisdom of your loyalty, fair Bianca, has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner.
So, without further ado, the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways.
When are you getting married, madam?
I feel sorry for you.
You’ll find out everything in due time.
Oh, that’s with worry.
Thanks, my good countryman.
Just as bad, my lord.
God, what a burden on you I must have been!
I knew your father.
I’m here, my lord.
What were you before this?
Where’s that snake?
It came from a neutral party, not from someone opposed to you.
I figure that once he’s crippled me, I’ll beg by showing off my beatings.
Take away the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
Here, take the ring.
Yes, it is.
What should we do about that?
All right, stop this.
Goodbye.
Ma'am, I’d rather— I know your lady Goneril doesn’t love her husband.
I think that our father will leave here tonight.
So listen up, princess.
But I’m sorry—I’m not allowed to let you visit them.
Tear him apart, tear him up!
No, we’ll sneak away at supper time, disguise ourselves with masks at my house, and come back in an hour.
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds, which are now useless, seething inside your skulls.—All of you stand there in my spell.—
A man who’s robbed, but doesn’t miss what’s stolen, isn’t robbed at all.
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague.
It has the mark of 
Oh, rude and unthankful boy!
Is it young Romeo?
So if four negatives make two affirmatives, I’m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes.
Find out who did it!
Here is his Majesty.
Come on, get ready.
Take these keys and get more spices, Nurse.
Maybe, but you’re wrinkled all the same.
Have you ever heard of anything like that, Roderigo?
Tell the army to flee.
What do you say, Signior Gremio?
She’s an excellent, sweet woman, and there’s no doubt that she is virtuous.
Well, she got away.
Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes.
Where is Duncan’s body?
This is Trebonius.
That’ll happen soon enough.
I’ll steal away to England, and I’ll steal some more when I get there.
Death, which has taken her away to make me cry, now ties up my tongue and won’t let me speak.
That’s the one: Leonato’s Hero, your Hero, every man’s Hero.
Is there such a place?
It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes.
You should get a wife!
We come to hate that which controls us.
Madam, how are you liking this play?
I’m going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you’ve caused me.
And this is all because of our argument.
My lord, how are you feeling?
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed, and they match the fencing accessories.
Now please listen, sir.
And her cook yelled, mocked, and teased me, right?
Buck up, boy!
Go to him, petition him.
You threw it at her rudely, and she wants you to take it back.
Didn’t he say my brother has run away?
Read your history!
Here in the tent.
Go, tell the Prince.
Sir Paris, I’ll make a desperate argument for my child’s love.
You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower.
Our leader is being led.
I’m happy to say “amen” to that!
Not even to get her fan, or her gloves, or her mask, or anything?
Transform your grief into anger.
I mean, what do the words say?
Go on, wear your boots out!
I’m doing so.
If he’d written nice things, I’d swear yes right away.
I will live in your heart, die in your lap, and be buried in your eyes—and, what’s more, I will go with you to your uncle’s.
My husband said she was unfaithful!
I see Regan and Goneril in hell—A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them!
Ask me any commonsense question.
Call me the worst liar?
From the time I was seventeen, over sixty years ago, I have lived in this house, but now I will live here no more.
Is it daytime?
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather, from whom your own title to the crown derives.
Goneril, are you coming with us?
Show me.
What’s the matter, lieutenant?
His insane period is over.
He’s a good man.—Let’s go, Desdemona.
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well—he’s just civil, as Seville as an orange, with the same jealous-yellow complexion.
I’m not a traitor.
Yet you killed my children.
Wait, sweet Beatrice.
Oh, father, I’m taking care of your business.
Come, Katherine Queen of All, reveal your heart to me in broken English.
To me it looks like a weasel.
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s oppression.
Which he quickly allowed, given that you’re an obstacle to his lust.
That’s because you are near me, and you’re as dazzling as the sun.
Then do so, with all your heart.
Nature took Helen’s  Cleopatra’s majesty, The best of Atalanta, And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty.
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
Oh, to hell with those people!
Go after him and try to calm him down a little.
To hell with your sword.
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face, she was the fairest creature in the world—and even now she has no equal.
Run to the Capitol and nothing else?
I think I do.
I’d rather break my own heart.
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured.
Or are we both on drugs?
Stanley, pay attention to your wife’s doings.
After such a long period of grief, we will have such a celebration!
Whose tongue?
Come with me; I’ll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me.
I have to ask you, as a favor, not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right.
To answer your question, ma'am—yes, he was friendly with those knights.
She will wither and come to a bad end.
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar?
When I left him, he was less than nine miles from here.
I saw her, but I didn’t notice her.
And the Prince and Claudio, who accused her, are innocent as well, because they were deceived by Don John.
Quickly, quickly, good Iras, quickly.
Have you told her our decision?
I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen.
The rapier and the dagger.
And tell her, listen to me, on Wednesday—Wait—What day is today?
I did—and now I’ve got it!
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief?
Casca, you’ll be the first to raise your hand.
He’s arrived.
Truly, lady, you have a merry heart.
If, then, that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar, this is my answer: it’s not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
Even if we don’t fight foreign enemies, we’ll beat down these rebels at home.
You’re right.
Stanley, what news do you have?
My lord, if you have a free moment, I have a message from His Majesty.
Maybe until after Theseus’s wedding day.
No, ma'am.
Didn’t you call him a liar?
The captain—give it to the captain.
Actors can’t keep a secret.
I’m really worried about that.
Goodbye, boy.
With half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him.
Caliban!
Listen, boy!
Hunt them down.
First, Peter Quince, tell us what the play is about, then read the names of the actors, and then shut up.
Mistress, you know about that.
Give me your arm.
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I’ve shown how inappropriately he’s behaved— Here, ma'am.
Have you sent anyone to Bottom’s house?
If it pleases your Majesty, let his neck pay the price, if there is any martial law in the world.
If you choose that one, I’m yours, along with the picture.
If she’d been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her.
That’s the deal.
Goodbye, then.
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things.
Leave me alone, Desdemona, go away!
She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me.
Our master and mistress are looking for you.
Yes, my good lord.
No, stop.
Get them in here—Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.
Women, dress me like a queen.
Then go gather your men, but leave behind your son, George Stanley.
Well, my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot, while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot.
And  Madam, with all my heart.
Besides, you’ve gotten unreliable.
It is, my lord.
Indeed, before you arrived here, old Siward, with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle, was making his way here.
You got to me first.
Any trick that works is good for me.
Your father!
I’m not insane, Sir Topas.
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape.
Mister Challenger, the princess wants to speak to you.
You come here with letters against the king, and you take his conceited daughter’s side against his royal highness.
Have a good life.
He’s here, sir, but please don’t bother him.
And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat?
Remember the reward we’re getting when the deed’s done.
Shouldn’t I say, “Does a dog have money?
If we are slated to die, the fewer, the better for our country, and if we’re slated to live, the fewer men, the greater the share of honor for each of us.
Othello’s career is over.
No, madam.
Don’t joke about this, Enobarbus.
Look, here I have Macbeth’s cursed head.
Why are you making these faces?
A pretty pathetic monster.
Have a nice day!
You can figure out the rest.
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you, but his mother wouldn’t let him.
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses.
You’d better go inside.
If that’s what you want, all right.
Come, then, and send his body to Thasos.
Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral.
As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest.
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad.
Once we have covered the two servants with blood, and used their daggers to kill, won’t people believe that they were the culprits?
At dinner.
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion.
Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel?
What was it?
How I wish you felt better!
Uncle, please give me your dagger.
I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty.
No, don’t hit him, lieutenant!
However your wit and luck allow.
Help me here.
Thank you, brave Cassio.
Who’s coming here?
What about you?
Let it go up to heaven.
Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own.
Is she really that wonderful?
I don’t know, madam.
For there never was a pretty woman who didn’t like to preen in the mirror.
That is a certain truth.
Antonio, you’re under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino.
Not until you pass out.
The poor souls—how strangely they talk!
Do I speak to you kindly?
Loss upon loss!
To tell the truth, Gratiano, you’re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset.
Now, by my mother’s son, and that’s me, it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I’ll travel to your father’s house.
I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you.
I’ll limp after you.
The king has broken his heart.
Both fencers are bleeding—how do you feel, my lord?
I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him.
I’m ready.  
I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance.
Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me.
His faults were equally matched by his virtues.
I thumb my nose at superstitions.
Who’s ruining my rituals of true love?
Her eyes are saying something.
Has anyone seen Cesario?
I’ll be there shortly.
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves.
As a friend.
The will!
Where’s Publius?
What can I say to him, lady?
Brutus, my country’s friend.
I wish you had told me you had a different father.
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection, I’ll be your mirror and show you, without exaggeration, things inside you that you can’t see.
I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from.
Lunatics, lovers, and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations.
I said you had a fine wit.
I wish none of this had happened, given the situation here, and your rank.
Get us out of here.  
I know they do, and I certainly deserve it.
That he was never trained as a soldier.
Won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated?
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples?
The privilege of never seeing me again.
Please!
I did, kind lady.
Has it come to this?
Come down, look no more.
Alright, here’s the vial.
Moreover, out of mercy, the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent, so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where, poor wretches, their bodies will likely fall and fester.
Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart.
He commanded me to wake him up early.
I’ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute.
There must be something in the air here.
What a man, young lady.
He’s somewhere between boy and man.
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless.
Come, come.
She said if she were interested in someone, it would be someone who looked like me.
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection!
Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time.
That was a fine fanfare, boys.
I saw you at Count Orsino’s recently.
And now he’s gone.
So go in peace.
Well, I’ll go to Scone.
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven.
There’s another.
Don’t snap at me.
Huh!
Yes, husband.
So why aren’t our eyelids heavy?
Make room!
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin; if you were a poet, I might have some hope you were lying.
The lady’s overdoing it, I think.
Well, I hope not.
Let’s follow him.
Oh, Stephano, two men from Naples survived!
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.” That’s a nice group of people.
You’re as pale as your nightgown!
Please give in, sweet Hermia.—And Lysander, stop acting like she’s yours.
I think his soul’s in hell, my lady.
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her.
Soldier, you must come to the king.
Yes, sir, it’s all too true, God help us.
Most noble Caesar!
Please, will you take his arm?
Oh, not you again.
Political business is bothering him, and he’s just taking it out on you.
Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am.
Will you two help them get ready?
You’ve won.
Let it go.
You’re pale and trembling.
Good-bye.
Let him be for a bit.
By my birth I rank above you, but don’t be afraid of my greatness.
Will I be married tomorrow morning?
But listen to me, signor—
If you meet the Prince in the night, you can order him to stop.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Listen to my little story, and when it’s done, oh, my heart will break!
I hope your Majesty will, in all good conscience, bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alençon and that your Majesty gave it to me.
Please give me that.
It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times.
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately.
He laughed at that and let me go.
My lord, most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard.
You know, you’re right.
What will we say is our excuse for being here?
You don’t know why we came to visit you— Yes, and so unexpectedly, at night.
Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed.
Oh, grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me.
What’s wrong, Hecate?
The sails were dyed purple, and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love.
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak.
Well, sir, because silver has a sweet sound.
You’ll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight.
If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again.
I accept your devotion with my deepest love.
You have a fat friend at your master’s house: she took care of me in the kitchen today, thinking I was you.
Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook?
Reborn.
If you’re as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you, this will definitely come to a happy end.
Is it not enough, is it not enough, young man, that I’ll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius?
Oh no, good Cassio!
These things are beyond anything we’ve seen before, and I’m afraid.
I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it.
She was a hellcat in school.
Tomorrow, while it’s still early, I will go see the witches.
Before I hear him, I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France.
I had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I planned to say nothing more on the topic.
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country.
Receive all the blessings of a happy father.
I’ll come too.
Oh, I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer!
Not until we part as friends.
Please, hurry up.
Would you walk out with me, sir?—Oh, Desdemona— Yes, my lord?
Good old lord Gonzalo,” as you call him, is saddest of all, with tears running down his beard.
Where are your tenants and your followers?
Go to hell, you whore!
I don’t mean that she wants me because  What’s she like?
They’re looking for you in the great chamber.
Which one is Sebastian?
No, Orlando, men are like April when they’re wooing a girl—young, and passionate—but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled.
If he’s caught, he’ll never make trouble for anyone again.
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife.
Thieves!
And why’s that?
So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support.
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles, he can always kill himself.
But how can you say that, when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne?
Out.
Come on.
Locked in her tomb.
What does Caesar want?
Let me be your servant.
You’re not in love either?
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels?
He’s a traitor.
How nice of you!
You’re serious enough to know not to play games with Satan.
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
The duke went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
Did you see Octavia?
Right this instant, I’m going to Caesar’s funeral.
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education.
Be content.
That upsets me much more than getting wet.
Like that.  
Yes, what time is it?
Their villainy nauseates me, and I must therefore vomit it up.
I’ll do my best, madam.
You sound out of tune.
You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade.
Stay and tell me more.
I’m not marvelous, sir, but I’m certainly a maiden.
I will not rise until your Highness hears me.
I’ll leave now, to set all these things right.
I’m not well.
My thoughts were never on money.
Let’s go there.
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums, the flute and the splendid banners, and all those proud displays and pageantry of war!
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves?
I’m a foolish, senile old man, eighty-something years old, not an hour more or less.
Yes, I’ve been responsible for his upbringing.
This is the way to trick gullible fools.
Good grief, do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man, I have a man’s patience?
I go, Caesar.
Swear you won’t.
For more important things, you’ll say no.
So I die with a kiss.
But they aren’t.
His nurse?
I’d second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista’s youngest daughter.
I’ll do anything rather than marry a drunk, Nerissa.
Doors, open up for whoever is knocking!
Here, drink to me.
And I see you survived your time in Egypt.
He’s going to look like a total idiot.
Will you cry?
He’ll come right away.
Here’s more insanity for us.
With a touch of green in it.
Then I’ll be quick.
My name is Mary, sir.
Come on, good fellow, help me into that armor you’re carrying.
May a plague strike both your houses.
I’m just worried that you’ve been cozying up to her, and gotten intimate with her.
We need some oracle to tell us what’s going on.
But let it rain; I’ll survive.
Believe me, I’m not.
No more than I do yours.
You heard her say it wasn’t me.
Is that true, my lords of England?
No, Caesar doesn’t have epilepsy.
Oh, I’m very scared something awful has happened.
One more time, we proclaim this publicly: If anyone will pay this man’s bail, he will not be put to death.
Get out of here quickly!
Your whole family will be ruined.
I know her by her walk.
He is a gentleman of a good family, and for his ransom, he will give you two hundred crowns.
You didn’t want to go then!
I’ll vouch for Grumio.
You are not, Cassius.
As clearly as I see you, my lord.
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
Shall I be tempted by the devil?
So how can anyone say I’m alone, when the whole world is here to look at me?
That’s not fair.
He has come to kill my heart.
Now, you lie there on the path.
You call it my “ Don’t you know?
The next day we had our fight at sea, and you know what happened after that.
No more, no more.
Oh, do not wish one more!
For the love of God, call a doctor!
Come, last of my friends, rest on this rock.
Find out where the Jew’s house is.
Calm down.
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar, who comes in triumph over Pompey’s defeated sons?
If you want to see your deceiver, then look at me.
Take up the sword again, or take me up.
My uncle Clarence’s angry ghost.
You don’t?
You and he are both welcome, sir.
Oh, madam, my old heart is broken, broken.
No rescue for me?
And what are you going to do with it?
Yes, you have to tell us why, Sir Andrew.
By God!
Am I myself?
honor you.
Has your heart cooled toward me?
You belong to her.
This way, we can see how the world moves.
But who are you?
Sir, enter the castle.
Here is a friar who’s trembling, sighing and weeping.
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio, the Prince, and me.
But wait, there’s some prose after her poem.
Let us prepare for our wedding.—On that day, I’ll take your oath of loyalty, my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers, to guarantee my treaty.
How can it be?
Why are you adored?
Well, time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal.
Well, Syracusian, tell us–briefly–why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus.
Here comes my little bird.
I am their father’s mother.
I swear I will, and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster.
Nobody will hurt us.
You really don’t recognize me, father?
Turn right at the next turn, but at the following turn, turn left.
We’ll come with you, your Grace.
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others.
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest.
The  Right.
Do as I asked you.
It was a painful bruise, and she was crying bitterly.
Don’t make me wait for dinner even a moment.
Did we, my lord?
Oh, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
Fear will keep you safe.
All right then, back home we go.
Your life insurance?
Don’t keep anything back, I insist.
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die, for she says she’ll die if he doesn’t love her, and that she’ll die before she tells him, and she’ll die if he woos her and she’s made to hold back even one of her usual insults.
You’re my lieutenant now.
I tell you, I’m as sane as any man in Illyria.
I’m hoping for better.
The moral of this story is that it’s not enough to speak; you have to speak grammatically.
Ugh!
It’s our destiny, like death.
Which troupe is it?
I thank you, lady.
If I repeated it to you, it would kill you as soon as you heard it.
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten, because he’ll be too miserable for dinner.
Yes, but they don’t see anything.
Lucentio’s son is older than that, sir.
I take all responsibility for my decisions.
Motley is the only thing to wear.
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here, because he’s clearly disturbed.
Oh, what a wonderful new world, that has such people in it!
You men are rank beginners!
He’s talking with the bogus father about the bogus son.
Madam, please let me see your face.
He is the general challenger.
My countrymen— Silence!
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart.
Your  I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood.
Though I am not a flattering, righteous man, at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain.
Oh, she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means.
It’s some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua.
We should speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
No, you won’t get a word out of me.
Aren’t they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships?
My name is Decretus.
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning.
Your slander has broken her heart, and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb—ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness.
By Jove that thunders!
He looks angry.
Tell them to slick down their hair, brush their blue coats, and make sure their socks match.
And from now on, when you get hot with me, I’ll assume it’s your mother speaking and leave it at that.      
That will tell you a lot.
At your service, madam.
I’ll wait for you in your cave, where you can tell me what you need from me.
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs.
I can’t do everything I want to, but I’ll help you as well as I can.
That’s what he says.
Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?
I will either get you out, lying if I have to, or stay in prison in your place.
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully.
Help me, help me!
What do you mean, beside yourself?
Go to Adriana, you scoundrel, and quickly.
If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor, speak to me.
Then my children will probably be illegitimate.
Well, let’s watch it.
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year, I swore I’d never speak to them again.
But you’re too good a friend for me to wish her on you.
But their trick failed.
Howl, howl, howl, howl!
It is “music with her silver sound,” because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds.
But in this case of wooing, a child shall father his own father—if my wits don’t fail me.
This island belongs to me because Sycorax, my mother, left it to me.
Defend yourself!
Farewell.
By the light of heaven, no, I would not!
Yes, your Highness.
Want?
No, not at all.
Everything will be all right.
Caesar, you’re not going to be killed by a traitor—unless you kill yourself..
I never saw a better-designed gown, more elegant and pleasing and well made.
Pardon me, but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said.
And let me kill Cassio.
Then you really are insane, if you’re no saner than a fool.
What time is it?
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning.
I’d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers.
Oh sir, I accept.
Mistress, I swear on my life that it’s true.
You’re torturing me, Tubal.
For, as I am a soldier, the name I think suits me best, once I begin my attack on Harfleur again, I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes.
And didn’t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you?
I came here to tell you—I’ll make this short, since she’s already been talked about for too long—the lady is unfaithful.
May good fortune come to you, good Petruchio!
At his best he’s a little less than a man, and at his worst he’s little more than an animal.
His daughter and I will be king and queen—God protect us!—and you and Trinculo will be our governors.—Do you like that idea, Trinculo?
What, you’re leaving it with Lysander?
What is this passion that ties up my tongue?
Very impressive.
Be patient, your highness.
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood.
Tell me.
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception.
Will you be crowned tomorrow?
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield.
I’m not a man who talks a lot, but I thank you.
He wants to eat the English.
Wait, here’s a penny to heal your head.
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away, or wait awhile.
What have you got on your head?
It carried us toward Corinth–or so we thought.
Stop, Demetrius!
If you do that, I’ll never respect you again.
It is, it is.
We owe you love and service forever.
My lord, I informed them as much.
You’d make a good fool.
Hey, Nurse!
Excellent!
He had no patience.
Something about Hamlet.
Therefore, my old age is like a blustery winter: cold, but kindly.
I eat the air, like chameleons do.
I’m telling you, your husband.
I don’t dare, sir.
What are the chances of his getting better, lords?
Hail to your majesty.
That was good planning, and you’ll sleep some more.
I’m glad.
Be convincing.
This contract doesn’t give you any blood at all.
You said she slept with Cassio.
of her father.
I’m here, I’ve been destroyed by villains!
And why, wise lady?
What do you say?
The gods protect him from so great a shame!
This is the man.
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
That’s true.
Get out, you horrible poison.
Can you smell out his secret now?
Oh, darling Phoebe, if you ever fall in love with some fresh face, then you’ll know about the invisible wounds that love’s sharp arrows can make.
You can relax, ma'am.
Never contradict him.
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened.
What, out in a storm in the middle of the night?
Come over here, nurse.
You taught me language, and all I can do with it is curse.
He’s subhuman, like an animal.
Could you tell me how near the enemy is?
Madam, Count Orsino’s young messenger has returned.
Look out, I’m on my way up.
So she was moved by it?
Your husband, being saddled with a shrew, projects his own suffering onto my husband.
Then we won’t agree to his demands.
Wait, good Beatrice.
No.
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart.
Nurse, will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I’ll need to wear tomorrow?
It’s unbelievable.
True.
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs?
To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream.
I’m helping  Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while.
Get her attention and draw her home with music.
Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here.
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die, and in the meantime, we’ll laugh at his challenge.
Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own.
Yes, we will.
Damn you, don’t mock and sneer at me.
No, they’re busy and as excellent as ever.
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father, you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy.
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today.
They’ll be here tomorrow or the next day.
I’m telling you, it was Carthage.
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this?
You’ve bet on the weaker fencer.
Wait, look!
What kind of god is ceremony, which suffers more than its worshippers do?
And I know that unless the law intervenes, it’ll be bad news for poor Antonio.
But you’re still complaining of darkness and a bad view?
If he won’t stop when he’s told to, then he isn’t one of the Prince’s subjects.
He’s not getting anything except the penalty.
It’s late.
She’s probably right.
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans, and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you.
Oh no!
You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia.
We’ve been praying for our husbands' welfare.
I’d like to munch on some good dry oats.
What, you want them to weep our horses' blood?
Alright, let’s fight, boy!
Look at my face.
May heaven bless you.
My soul is made out of lead, and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can’t move.
I know you from before.
But stop, I say.
When she takes a sip, I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck.
I wish I could see this invisible drummer.
I’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me.
I heard someone say that’s what it means.
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late.
Will you fight well?
Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— Quiet, shut up!
Tell me, why did the king arrive with such a small entourage?
Meet me at the synagogue.
Or, if he wrote down his thoughts, give me his letter.
The young generation rises while the old one falls.
How are you?
Yes, the second time around, since, as they say, old people become children again.
That’s just what I thought.
You don’t know what money can buy.
Well, God is responsible for that, not me, and he deserves thanks.
Boy!
Now I say good night to your bones, Hero.
I like you very much.
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning.
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle: either too much at once or none at all.
Look at this man.
Why would you celebrate it?
I swear, sir, you did not eat at home.
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death.
It’s not manly.
I’m not talking with you.
It was just moments ago.
If you can’t do it, be grateful you’ve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin, if it comes to that.—Harder, men!—Now get out of our way, I’m telling you.
It said, “Love me and don’t leave me.” How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring?
Fool, I say!
Of course I hear it.
Good madam, be patient.
Whew!
It’s revolting!
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan’s pipe.
They’re overdoing it.
All the rest of you can leave too.
Even though half of him is like a 
Does everyone kill what they don’t love?
If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you?
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb.
Now, Antony, our prayers have been answered.
Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other?
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears?
That was no show.
Isn’t that enough?
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk, York’s comrade and equal in brave wounds.
Trebonius knows his cue.
If you fight to protect your wives, your wives will welcome you home as conquerors.
They were villains, murderers.
If you’re my friend, you’ll let me see his letter.
Of what 
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage, I order you on your souls to say so.
I’ll bite you on the ear for that joke.
They’re well too.
I’d kiss you before I spoke.
Give my answer to them both.
This is getting worse and worse!
Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news would make kings cry.
I’ll follow in the center of the troop formation, which I’ll defend with my best horse, and with Saint George on my side, as well!
Signor Brabantio, hey!
He’s wearing yellow stockings.
I’m the one who— I’ll get right on that.
Has it been a quiet night?
Now, Balthazar, you’ve always been honest and faithful to me, and I trust you still are. 
He started it, my noble lord, and succeeding generations rebuilt it.
Oh, oh, oh!
I hope you’ll be a good father to me now.
Cesario is my name—your servant’s name—fair princess.
Are you insane?
What do you mean, get rid of him?
Do that.
Hello to you.
It’s too small for your large mind.
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo.
Oh well.
Have you seen him today?
Lock the doors.
Go quickly—hurry—to the castle, for I’ve given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed.
I was born as free as Caesar.
A grave?
Do whatever you want with it.
It’s the former Hero!
If I told them about this back in Naples, would they believe me?
In our case, our bad neighbors over their make us early risers, a healthy and sensible thing to be.
I shall faint.
Why did I come here if not for that?
Did he charge interest?
It’s time to leave.
Fast!
And what will you do if it returns to you?
Daughters who can make you obey them.  
Dromio?
Get out of my sight!—I guess if she doesn’t love her father, then I’ll only have peace when I’m dead.—Call the King of France.
If love plays rough with you, play rough with  Come on, let’s knock and go in.
Speak softly.
Come on, relax, dear.
I’m completely lost.
You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee.
And here I am, going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can’t find my Hermia.
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing.
Let’s have more sex in the world, since Gloucester’s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters, conceived in lawful wedlock, have been to me.
Who can blame him for acting crazy, when inside he condemns himself for everything he’s done?
In the beautiful city of Verona, where our story takes place, a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence, and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens.
Whenever you want, since you’re the one who wants it.
Ah, it’s a sensitive animal, with a good conscience.
They say they have letters for you.
Oh my!
My life has run its circle.
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books; or you can bash his skull with a log; or you can stab him in the belly; or cut his windpipe.
Take me to Octavius.
No I don’t, believe me.
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning.
If either of you were a prince’s son, and you were imprisoned as I am now, and two murderers like yourselves came to you—wouldn’t you beg for your life?
I tell you, this house is as dark as ignorance.
It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe.
Did she see you there the whole time, old boy?
Please remember, love.
Every old man has worries, and worried men never get any sleep, but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world.
So you’ll bring the necklace to her yourself?
I could take back my crown by force—What outrageous ingratitude!
I like it too.
Time ambles for both men.
Why are you knocking so hard?
I went to many places where I heard news about her, but I couldn’t find her.
Oh, it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this, things that I can’t remember.
Well, he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation.
Oh do-de, do-de, do-de.
When will there be another like him?
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night, lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights.
You don’t know how to pick a man.
That’s it!
Really, are you afraid of that?
Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative?
Enough!
If not, goodbye.
There’s no need to be, really, for—  You’re my teacher, so I must believe you.
If it’s possible to do this without putting yourself in danger, dear Captain Blunt, say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note.
Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re having a hard time getting up now?
I’d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you.
I don’t know.
Oh, fine.
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me, for if her hunger is satisfied, she’ll pay no attention to the bait.
Why, what is there to do before I get there?
Rest assured that we’re going there to use our hands, not our tongues.
Not with any sauce they could provide for them.
I’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more.
I can’t love him.
Amen.
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already.
I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer.
As I get to leech him, I will show some mercy.
With Rosaline, father?
Portia, what are you doing awake?
Clink your cups together in a toast!
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place, the heavens will not bless your relationship, but will overwhelm you with hate, contempt, and discord, and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it.
I’ve felt neglected recently, but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind.
What are you talking about?
The servants, the duke, and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly.
Here’s some money for you.
Nothing.
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore?
Oh, be quiet.
Who’s next?  
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story.—Good old man, you are as welcome here as your master is.
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven’t done anything wrong?
In God’s name, speak.
He gives BIONDELLO  Here comes Baptista.
Are you his brother?
Othello isn’t any of those things.
He asks her to do what God  Say she will be a high and mighty queen.
Well, what’s your plan?
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey, a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime.
My uncle is king of Denmark, and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him.
He didn’t know how to stop it.
Yes, sir, and I’ll leave when you ask me to.
Farewell.
It’s the same with men.
When the actors were talking about poison?
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree, quite outside of his own sphere.
Oh God, what a heinous sinner I am, being ashamed to be my father’s child!
God bless your Grace!
He has captured Toryne.
He is.
You can judge for yourself what I mean.
Catch me if you can!
You call this a scale?
I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear of capture.
Play some music while he chooses.
It’s time for me to go.
But what can be done to prevent it?
It’s Captain Macmorris, right?
Tell her to come here.
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I’m not smart, but he wouldn’t bet two cents that you’re not a fool.
I am satisfied, as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her.
Romeo, get out of here.
Give him room.
I ate with him and my sister.
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose?
So, are you done?
We’ve got it now.—Do you see this, my good fellow?
What man were you talking to at your window last night, between the hours of midnight and one?
What should I swear by?
It’s a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua.
But Angelo, you’ll pay for this, even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop.
Did you speak to him?
What have you done?
I won’t give up this child for all of Fairyland.
Leave me for a bit.
Let the world collapse around us.
It’s almost fairy time.
Undress the statues if they’re decorated in honor of Caesar.
Never apologize—when the actors are all dead, no one can be blamed.
Your mother was extremely virtuous, and she said you were my daughter.
I think he’s nervous—he’s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated.
I’ll never speak to you again.
Madam!
My name’s Macbeth.
Polite sir, let me say one thing.
Are you his friend?
You know what you know.
But truly, if I were as 
I won’t say anything negative about what he might be.
What do you mean by all this?
Nothing, good sir, except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head.
If luck deserts us today, it’s because we defy it.
Damn her!
Macbeth!
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him.
It was a color he never did like.
Where’s your servant 
Where does he sleep?
Who are you?
That’s the right attitude.
Is that the man?
I order you, speak!
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife.
Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland, I arrest you for high treason.
What’s the bet?
Swear by my sword.
Please wait.
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor, I am the most guilty soul alive.
Get up, get up, and look at this image of doomsday!
No, my lord, I didn’t see anything.
What is logical, then, my lord?
That’s what made him crazy.
They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory.
Yes, it stinks very sweetly.
You, I think, would best know what he’s thinking.
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert.
Tell us what you know about this affair.
God say, “Amen”!
Farewell, and thanks.
What will be my evidence?
Benedick, Beatrice praised your wit the other day.
I’m so crazy about you!
Hey, naked guy— Poor Tom’s chilly.
How?
Caesar might act like that.
Bring that swinger Orlando here.
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love.
If we’re  Hello, Monsieur Le Beau.
I am indebted to you for your last sermon.
I look forward to getting to know you better.
You give your best praise to the worst women.
At other times, I know what’s what.
I’m a fool.—Let’s go, Lorenzo.—Goodbye for now.
My eyesight has always been bad.
Stop crying.
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men.
I’ll help you, Sir Toby.
Prison, my lord?
I could swear this is the real Vincentio.  
But if you decide not to marry me, you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead?
Please go back to Goneril’s house.
What do you have to say, noble friend?
Where is my wife?
Lord,” he calls you?
On a night like this!
Good noble ladies, be brave.
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master’s?
That’s why they say love is a child.
But for the whole world?
He picked out the letter “G” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “G” will take the throne away from his children.
I’m here.
Where are the evil men who started this fight?
Aren’t you dead yet?
I know I may be old, but I’m strong and healthy, because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly.
I’ll read it.—It looks so unlike Portia!
Now all my enemies are at my mercy.
Follow”?
Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest.
Three or four women near me cried, “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts.
I must go in. 
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone.
I’ve been transformed somehow, haven’t I, master?
What a wise judge!
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses, his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we’ve shed, and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with.
Didn’t you know?
It’s been eleven years since the earthquake.
Who was it that came here?
We’ll be married tomorrow.
Listen, listen!
He’s trembling in his fit!
Den it shall also content me.
We came here to fight against you.
I know where I’ll wear this dagger, then.
It’s all stopped.
He thinks “G” is me.
I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you.
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up.
I’ve looked at many ladies with pleasure, and been
But be quiet, here comes Thisbe.
These are gracious tears.
Go ahead, but I won’t listen.
Beautiful ladies, please don’t treat me badly.
Yes, and paid me well for doing it.
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops.
But, look, poor me, what a terrible tragedy is here!
There’s your boyfriend, sleeping right over there.
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest; tomorrow we’ll march on.
Do you understand what I’m saying, man?
For Brutus’s sake, I am indebted to you.  
Has anyone offended your Worship?
Come on, then.
I’ll stay in Messina until you’re married, and then I’ll go to Aragon.
Sir, let’s get to the point.
Oh, that’s nonsense!
I look forward to getting to know you better, Mr. Mustardseed.
People who die of it seldom or never recover.
But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men.
Let’s stay and hear the will!
I admit it doesn’t look that way to me, and the fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart.
Is it possible?
That’s what I hear.
Antipholus, aren’t you originally from Corinth?
Who comes with him?
Guys who’d take her with all her faults, provided there were enough money involved.
I’m going back into battle.
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth.
All right then, legitimate brother Edgar, I have to have your lands.
Let’s call for help and get them tied up again!
Your renowned uncle, Duke Menaphon, the famous soldier, brought me here.
It’s a monster!
Oh, you bloody prison, fatal and threatening to noble lords!
Oh, beautiful and accomplished lady, may the heavens rain odors upon you!
Come with me.
You have a beautiful half-sister, Octavia.
Amen!
But wait, what’s that sound?
I’m already here, sir.
But in your daughter’s womb I will bury them.
Didn’t this frighten our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
But you’re not down and out, either, are you?
Where is this man?
I’m sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you.
Curse you all, you’re all murderers and traitors!
You’re talking like some innocent girl who doesn’t understand the ways of the world.
I can imagine more than I can say—I have more on my mind than words.
What brings him here?
Good morning, father.
I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like.
What’s going on, my love?
Brutus, you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes.
Charmian!
It was windy on shore too.
He’ll kill me with tortures.
I’m sure I can guess.
God forbid!
Amen.
That’s her father and his friends, who’ve been roused out of bed.
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.
Yes, and that’s a serious failing.
I’d rather kill myself.
Why?
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man.
What does your grace want?
Here comes Antony.
Come shake hands with Laertes, Hamlet.
He would just see me for what I am, a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples.
We’ll meet at the Elephant.
I know I’m not fooling myself, or letting myself get carried away by my imagination, because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me.
I’m locked up in a prison and deprived of food.
True.
I’ll tell you before you have to ask me again.
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil heart.
Good news, good news!
What, here in the middle of the street?
I’m to blame for making you wait for me.
Be calm!
Oh, unfaithful lover!
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself, your Majesty.
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring.
The nasty devil’s biting my butt.
You’re competing for
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are!
If you don’t mind, I’d like to speak with you.
Ah, ladies, ladies!
What kind of man are you?
Then see a good one for me.
Everything’s fine.
I love you dearly, Ariel.
You don’t have to go yet.
It’s not friendly, and it’s not ladylike.
My lord of Orléans, and my lord high Constable, are you talking about horses and armor?
Divine, perfect woman, give me a chance to prove in detail that I’m innocent of the evils you accuse me of.
To hell with you!
That’s too bad, because I spent a long time memorizing it, and it’s poetic.
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace.
I feel I should recognize you and that man 
Surely, Luciana, it’s already two o'clock.
What are you, girl?
Let them put fear in your heart.
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has.
Has he come home yet?
Didn’t I?
A hundred then.
He’s getting worse and worse.
But mistress, know yourself.
Look, here comes Helena.
Niece, you are exceptionally perceptive.
Richard of York, how are you doing, my loving brother?
Be there, or don’t show your face again.
I’ll come soon.
It’s born of my  A witty mother!
Princes and counts!
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio.
Back when I was a schoolboy, if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction, watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first.
That’s right, and then after we fixed the moon, we’d go bird-hunting.
Look, here she comes!
Give me Bianca for my inheritance.
No.
No, the one I gave you.
Captain, I have a favor to beg of you.
Stop advising me; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve.
Women are like roses: the moment their beauty is in full bloom, it’s about to decay.
She will  A pimp!
I hate to say it, but it’s almost two and we won’t get there before suppertime.
Please don’t tell me any more.
It’s like a cockleshell or a walnut shell, a joke, a prank, a doll’s cap.
Was it a man?
And if your love can produce something from its sadness, write a poem for her; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones.
A duke who is noble in name and character.
Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me.
There’s nothing more.
Oh, don’t injure your cousin like that!
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say?
Yes, indeed they are.
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit?
Tell me, who is this knight?
Get me out of here!
I watched him very closely.
Let’s drink to our general!
You have.
Caius Ligarius, I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that’s made you so thin.
Oh, Caesar!
Oh, he hasn’t?
His position is hopeless.
I’m coming, don’t worry.
Mankind’s role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals.
What are you saying?
Let me go.
We’ll get married at some point, Audrey.
I didn’t find him at the Elephant.
I hear him.
Chop off his head.
Sir, I have no future ahead of me.
I’ve never seen him like this.
Yes, sir.
I wish I were Sleep and Peace, so I could spend the night with you.
Oh, how silly we are!
I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat.
Heaven knows what he’s going to do with it.
Just tell me what you want me to do, and however hard it is, you’ll see that I’m eager to do it.
All hail, Macbeth!
Well, you’ve given away all your other rightful titles.
Lord, Lord, when she was a little baby—Oh, there is one nobleman in the city, a guy named Paris, who would be happy to claim her as his own.
I want to stay more than I want to go.
If I didn’t have so many enemies in Orsino’s court, I’d go join you there.
I want to avoid that.
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings.
Here.
That way, he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers, weakening his own capacities, while we, lying still, are rested, energetic, and nimble.
I’m not sleepy at all.
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t?
But if I shake it up a little it’ll work, because every one of those letters is in my name.
How are you?
My noble uncle, do you know why he acts this way?
Arms, make your last embrace!
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me?
Can’t any prayers reach your heart?
I’m sure I’ll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew, my master.
If he’s angry, there must be something seriously wrong.
Go relax now.
Everybody knows I’m a nice piece of flesh.
Our guiding light is out.
I wouldn’t insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town.
Plantagenet.
Master Malvolio?
Still, it stands to reason that he mustn’t betray his fear, as it might dishearten his army.
I headed toward him, but he saw me coming and hid in the woods.
It’s a horrible thing to die when you’re not prepared for it, my gracious lord.
And last night at dinner, you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed, brooding and sighing, and when I asked you what was the matter, you gave me a dirty look.
Only to be generous and give it to you once more.
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl.
I’m amazed how similar you and your daughters are.
He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar.
Losers always leave quickly.
I have only come in—like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth.
Who’s coming with her?
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother?
Let them judge us however they please.
When?
Think of your sins.
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil.
Then I have to assume you don’t want him to be king.
Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for.
Are you done yet?
Here, sir!
It’s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes.
You’re not paying attention to me.
Orlando?
Get out of here, my friend.
Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die.
Wait, madam.
Brother John Bates, isn’t that dawn breaking over there?
Well, I recognize this one  Good God!
Eros, can you still see me?
I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon.
You’re a senator!
But fire also gives off light, and fire will burn you.
If you’re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and you say you’re my friend, how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment?
Pray, let me stay.
Are your tears wet?
At Friar Lawrence’s cell she can make confession and be married.
I think I hear the drums far away.
But I paid attention to where Cupid’s arrow fell.
If you put me in the stocks you’ll insult him both as a king and as a man.
No.
Sweet men, come to him.
My brains are injured.
Should I strike it with my spear?
I thank you very much on his behalf.
Isn’t he a horrible man?
No, by Saint Jamy, I’ll bet you a penny!
There’s no reason to be afraid.
Go, take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can.
Is your other mouth calling my name?
Conquer, crush, conclude, and kill!
I will.
Sir!
I just want everything to be all right between you.
Don’t worry, man, I won’t try to escape.
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat?
Where is he now?
He discovered that the man was his older brother.
What was your dream?
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden, or I’ll kick you out of my kingdom.
Let’s have him land and solemnly proceed to London.
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter.
I have done wrong, so I will suffer wrong.
I’m telling you, I hardly know myself.
Don’t misunderstand me, sir.
Be quiet.
It’s too bad.
Thank you for asking, uncle.
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller.
Please don’t play games.
Let’s leave him.
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice?
For my brother Edward’s sake.
Now I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death.
Stay and speak!
So far I’ve done exactly what I was supposed to do—I put the love potion on an Athenian’s eyes.
Struggling with the wind and rain.
Maria, our lady wants you.
I won’t take it.
Even that I could put up with.
But in the meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking she’s innocent, please.
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand  I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply.
What’s going on here?
I’m dying for food, so let me have some.
I have walked around the streets, exposing myself to the perilous night, unbuttoned like this, as you see, Casca, baring my chest to the thunderbolt.
King Lear, I’ve always honored you as king, loved you as my father, obeyed you as my master, and thanked you in my prayers— I’m furious and ready to snap.
That’s the one.
Are your men searching for him?
If that’s true, it makes up for all the sorrows I’ve ever known.
It’s midnight.
Please sir, if love or money can buy anything in this empty place, tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves.
While I stood spellbound, messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!
Why, to keep the eyes on the sides, so that you can see anything that you can’t sniff out.
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole.
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too.
But as far as I can tell, people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing.
Well, my friends, you’ve got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies, they’d have no choice but to execute us.
No, but Beatrice— Sweet Hero, she’s been wronged, she’s been slandered, she’s been ruined.
What support did we have besides our father?
Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment.
A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too, but different ones from what we heard and saw.
The sun glints off our armor.
Tonight is for celebrating!
Hamlet.” Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter, and more like it.
There’s something downright unnatural about it, if a philosopher stopped to think about it.
This is the perfect place to rehearse.
Bellario sends his greetings.    
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, I arrest you for high treason.
That’s very strange.
I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of, unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me.
Do so, good Messala.
Sadness over my son’s exile stopped her breath.
Well then, don’t bother.
It would be bad if she knew about Benedick’s love and teased him about it.
Oh, monstrous!
This imaginary suitor for Katherina—I’d buy him the best horse in Padua if he’d get here quickly, woo her, marry her, take her to bed, and rid the house of her.
Will you play this recorder?
Are you crazy?
If you insist on trying my patience any further, then take out your sword right now.
I am their aunt, and I love them like a mother.
You mock an ancient tradition, born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died, and then have the gall not to stand by your words.
I beg your pardon for loving you too much.
The king acts unnaturally—father against child.
Come, Dolabella.
Are you really saying these things, or am I dreaming?
But tell me—which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me?
With him out of Venice, I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money.—Go, Tubal.
You have my friendship.
What, faithful to being mean and nasty?
That is, if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca’s love.
He wants the child for himself, to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests.
I’ll give the first one, Pompey.
That’s him, that villain Romeo.
Whatever I say, or think, or do, you’re continually contradicting it.
Even my hair revolts.
Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him and encourage him.
And I see her also through the eyes of love.
I’m very afraid of Banquo.
I wish you’d won the  Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale.
Make the best use of this information you can.
That woman who claims I am her husband—I loathe her in my soul.
If you knew the reason, you’d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay.
Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there.
Time will tell what you’ve got up your sleeve.
If he said that, then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever.
If luck’s with me, I’ll lose a father, and you’ll lose a daughter.
I won’t allow it.
But I say amen to everything she said.
As I slept under this yew-tree here, I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him.
Well, all of these should be in the lantern, because they’re all in the moon.
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon.
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately.
I am the only daughter in my father’s family, and all the brothers too—but I’m not completely sure about that.
I’ll tell twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago.
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive.
Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where he fought against Pompey.
If he’s not in love with a woman, then you can’t trust the usual symptoms.
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.
You have impatience all over your face.
My lord, I will give them all they deserve.
What else could you possibly think of me?
with the same accessories.
One weakness led to another, to make me hate myself.
If you’ll take a simple man’s advice, don’t be here when it arrives.
Stop right there, sir.
What?
It would have been better if, after she said, “Tybalt’s dead,” she told me my mother or my father, or both, were gone.
Oh, you streetwalker!
Thank you very much.
Look!
Oh, so you’d give me all your tediousness?
Come, Kate, let’s go to bed.
Didn’t you figure out that I left you because I hate you?
I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on.
Isn’t he an honest man?
If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you again, and do everything I can.
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th.
Now that the wind is favorable, let’s board the ship.
By nine o'clock.
Why has your queen, Juno, called me here to this grassy spot?
There may be a time for everything, but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back.
Things have certainly changed!
To be good-looking is a matter of luck, but to read and write is a natural gift.
Lose nothing?
She was utterly true to you!
And you will be, or some people here will suffer for it.
This is the end of my journey, the end of my life.
This is a horrible sight.
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands.
What, would you have me beg for my food?
Why didn’t they just kill us that night?
I have responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man.
Answer that question.
Good morning, Richmond.
Quiet, you stupid fool.
Ah, I’ve got it!
Thanks, good Egeus.
My royal lord, you’re not entertaining the guests.
And smelled like that, too?
Amen, amen.
Then leave him out.
It will be hard if “Cambio” loses her.
Yes sir, I’m fairly witty.
Yes, madam, twenty different messengers.
But you had bad blood in you, no matter how much you learned, and good people couldn’t stand to be near you.
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind, then what does it mean to leave early?
Very nice to see you, sir.
That’s right.
No.
Go on.
You thug!
First rehearse your song from memory, and make sure each note is pretty.
Where are you running so fast?
Alexas!
I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything.
The whole world wants her.
Call yourself your own sister, because I want you.
Where is he?
Listen but don’t speak to it.
No more of this.
Hello!
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything.
You can’t see the future.
Oh, don’t worry about it—we’ll dip your    I’ll get you for that one.
They certainly will.
Your true demonic features are distorting your body.
I beg you, Strato, stay by me.
Let’s go.
Snip and snip and cut and slash—it’s got more holes than a sieve!
That?
He keeps tearing out his white hair, which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness.
Don’t ask me what I know.
Look, Don Pedro has come back for you.
But regarding what happened between us, don’t ask—I can’t tell you.
Can’t you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage?
Say it again—just one word, and my hand, which killed your lover out of love, will kill your far truer lover.
The morning is approaching.
Medicine is for the dogs.
Do you love me?
What, just because they kissed in private?
What, that’s all?
Love will give me strength, and strength will help me accomplish this plan.
You’re in the charge of an honorable man.
Horatio says we’re imagining it, and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now.
No, and she swears she never will.
Son, I’ll stake you half that Bianca comes.
I’ll die like a swan.
Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward.
Go look and then do the talking yourselves.
A love song, a love song.
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
Quiet!
We’ll answer.
I put those wedding sheets on your bed, as you asked.
Hit them!
Cicero is dead, by their decree.
Kent, father, sisters!
Enough.
Oh, what a bloody end to all this!
Cheer up, because I think you’re going to hell.
Where’s Cesario going?
No, Romeo will respond to the letter’s writer, telling him whether he accepts the challenge.
You see, her eyes are open.
Master Constable, you’re going about this all wrong.
Who’s there?
The noise is coming from over there.
Will you break my heart?
Let’s play.
What’s your name?
The Tower’s chaplain has buried them, but to tell you the truth, I don’t know where.
You’re an insolent little boy.
Dear general, I never gave you any reason to hate me.
I’d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman.
Give it up and go drink.  
My mind is confused.
His youngest daughter, the beautiful Bianca, is the jewel of my life, and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand.
Likewise, our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes, and their wounded steeds, ankle-deep in gore, struggle and, raging wildly, stamp on their dead masters with their hooves, killing them a second time.
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly.
His love is blind, so it belongs in the dark.
Yes, sir.
If I’m going to sing along with you, I need to know what key you’re singing in.
Oh, then I see you’ve been with  Who’s Queen Mab?
I’m not staying here to argue anymore.
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass, the cup becomes empty.
But how long will “ever” last?
If you pursue it, this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there.
Indeed?
Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture, I look like a saint exactly when I’m most like the devil.
In a way, I mean.
Take me to Antony.
This is my treasurer.
If you’re the ones setting my daughters against me, don’t let me be foolish enough to take it lying down.
Please, don’t take it badly, but I cannot and will not give in to you.
And here he is.
He’s a fool, a madman, and a drowned man.
So it’s no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster.
What’s the matter?
Well, well, well.
I don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul.
Look, my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me.
And me, too, my royal sovereign.
What’s keeping you?
I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave!
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house, to use as bait to catch these thieves.
I’m going.
I do dare, and I say that you are the villain.
She dropped it carelessly, and, seizing the opportunity, since I was here, I picked it up.
She’s not talking to me.
I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me.
Curse the day!
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose!
Actually, I’d like a few pounds of grass.
The sister of my wife, this lady here, is married to your son.
Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie.
Two of both kinds makes four.
Oh, he’s a gallant king!
Maybe, but I wish I’d never laid eyes on him.
If he is, that’s his problem.
Horatio, tell me something.
Let’s follow the old earl, and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go.
That’s what you’ll say once you’ve seen part two.
Listen, in books they say that true love always faces obstacles.
I admit the cape.
Brother, hey!
How can this drama be so many contradictory things?
She’s no longer my daughter, and I’ll never see her face again.
What does she want?
All right, but first let the ambassadors speak.
I want to go home.
I’ll stop at every house.
Snap out of your daze.
This is a nasty night to go swimming.
Yes, my lord.
The French have retreated, see, and there were great acts of courage.
I only want idiots following my advice, the advice of a fool.
Maybe he’s not feeling well.
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation.
Meanwhile I’ll stay with Regan with my hundred knights.
I hear what they say about him for doing that.
How do you mean, “conspired”?
Where did he get wine?
Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing.
I won’t deny him anything of mine, including my own body and my husband’s bed.
Bring them to me.
I’ve only given the articles a cursory glance.
No.
When they’re endangered, I save them.
It won’t go on.
Yes, from Normandy.
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs.
Sit down, Clitus.
Yes, but I didn’t see anything wrong, and I heard every syllable they said.
Call the numbskull back in here.
Paying debts is for peasants.
Oh, sir, pardon me!
I have to stay with the servants, who are with our camp’s luggage.
Therefore, do your duty and take your reward, because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death.
It did, it did.
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up?
My husband will save me.
As faithful as flies in rotting meat, which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows.
And you, sir, had me arrested over that necklace.
I can see you don’t like this gentleman.
Offer yourself more respect, or—not to beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock.
She’s crying.
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured.
Take that, and that.
Let’s stay and watch a while.
Convince him that he has been out of his mind—and when he says he’s out of his mind  My lord, I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him.
Oh, Ophelia, I’m bad at poetry.
For God’s sake, shut up!
If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!
We are men, my lord.
You will be the king.
A man no mightier than you or I in ability, yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight’s strange happenings.
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds, Shylock, so he doesn’t bleed to death.
Educated men are so impressive!
Where’s the cook?
Banquo, if your soul is going to make it to heaven, tonight’s the night.
Stay inside.
But oh, poor Glou-cester!
I hear someone knocking at the south entry.
Dromio, bring this money to the Centaur Inn, where we’re lodging, and wait there until I come.
Wish me luck.
It’s a wild night.
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend, and every one of them knows my name.
I’ll have you two hide—and the fool too—right where he’ll find the letter.
Where is the villain, Edmund?
Are they getting rusty?
Promising favors?
Gouge out his eyes!
So be it.
Virginity makes her look sick and green.
If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me.
I won’t leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back.—How are you, my lord?
But has Catesby gone?
Its own color.
Caesar wouldn’t take the crown.
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me, I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself.
And what will happen if I don’t?
We already knew that.
No, I’d rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men.
It’s so simple!
Yes, exactly.
Here and now I seem like Antony, but I can’t keep myself in this form, my boy.
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland?
You’re not one of Pinch’s patients, are you, sir?
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me?
You are a fool.—You, niece, prepare to leave.
What’s your business?
Very wise.
How did she get that candle?
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball, but it’s not smart of us to go.
This is his second fit like this.
Good Mr. Mustardseed, I know you very well.
Draw your trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your country.
What is it, my dear Bianca?
All right, have it your way.
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius.
Slay!
Now let the wind blow, waves swell, and ships sink!
Yes, my lord.
Bring them right in.
It stands by her bedside.
A beautiful voice, I swear.
So they think it’s a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment—two strong preventive medicines that foster long life.
Oh, what a sinful thought!
Pay you?
Okay, just do this, noble Catesby: sound out Lord Hastings, but make it seem as if you’re just mulling over the idea, that it hasn’t been firmed up yet.
It’s amazing, if I may say so, that she let herself be tamed.
Oh, come on.
Then I hope night shadows your day, and death takes your life!
If she is silent and won’t speak at all, I’ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence.
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look.
Call in the messengers and we’ll find out.
Oh, how brave of you!
And when I’ve sneaked up on my sons-in-law, then I’ll kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
Can we go?
In this recent storm.
But tell me, Egeus.
Sweet Montague, be true.
Yes, they’re spirits that I’ve called out of their prisons to perform my whims.
There was no Signior Montanto in our army.
Let’s go!
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are.
Look at you getting all riled up!
Caesar is listening.
But since,  To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal?
What handkerchief?
I wish there wasn’t so much dew on the ground.
You poor soul, your face has suffered many tears.
I didn’t, either.
He stole it from me.
God bless you for doing this.
Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner?
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup.
Yes.
What an enormous thing for us to forget!—Edmund, tell us, where’s the king?
It probably has something to do with… I don’t know.
You’ll find I’ll give it to you very willingly.
Your beautiful eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine with love.
What would you do about it?
If you leave me like this, you’re doing me wrong.
Probably because my cheeks' roses needed rain, which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes.
Feed him apricots and blackberries, with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.
Is it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say?
But mock me gently, dear Kate, because I love you terribly.
My cousin Westmoreland?
Iago’s a good man.
Sit down, worthy friends.
Pindarus, order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground.
Damned Iago!
So there’s a rift between Othello and Cassio?
Come with me, please.
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding.
Can’t you talk about anything besides ladies?
I’ve noticed it myself.
You scolded him in private?
Enough, gentlemen.
So calm down.
Why are you frowning like that?
Welcome home, Grumio.
You thought because he didn’t speak English like a native he couldn’t handle an English club.
Romeo killed Tybalt.
I gave it to Dromio, who rushed in for it.
Do tell.
Bring him to me.
I’m a prince by birth, Miranda—maybe even a king now; though I wish I weren’t—and normally I wouldn’t put up with carrying these logs any more than I’d let flies breed in my mouth.
Tell her that I, her king, am her lowly subject.
I know that, sir.
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter?
Again, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world—or even France or England!
Go on, get out of here.
What?
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown.
Your joke is a very bitter apple.
Well, for your good looks, sir, thank God and don’t boast about it.
What’s going on, Rosalind?
Oh, my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors.
I have to tell you, I thought you were a much kinder person than this.
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter.
But in spite of all this, the man is still wealthy enough.
How old is she?
Give me your hand, Messala.
I’ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once.
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay?
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.
But don’t think I’m doing this because I’m greedy.
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.
Jailer, watch out for this one.
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit.
Be silent and go in.
I think someone’s coming from Venice.
Silence!
I did it myself.
No, I haven’t had lunch.
Leave her to God and her own guilt.
Well, then, put your sword away.
I don’t like the way he’s acting, and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control.
What is this news about?
Really, he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice.
In England this strange monster would be just like a man.
Let me have it now.
I loved wine and gambling, and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem.
Any man can get drunk sometime.
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast.
And you, sister?
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill, you shouldn’t try to hold on to it or it’ll break your neck.
Let me know.
Please, don’t speak to him.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, but tonight doesn’t count.
He is my dear friend, your Majesty.
I must be as stupid as an ass—that’s why I don’t know her, but she knows me.
For lead?
Madam, hurry as fast as you can get out of my court.
You’ll grant me, you hedgehog?
Then I salute you with this royal title: long live Richard, England’s worthy king!
What is there left to do?
That light is not daylight, I know it.
I told you, sir, they were totally drunk, so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces, and beating the ground for touching their feet—yet even when drunk, they kept their plan firmly in mind.
Oh, you men are made of stone!
Get me some poison tonight, Iago.
How are you, Hamlet?
Come on, my dear Greek philosopher.
Hush, Grumio.
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor.
That’s merciful but a bit careless.
Really, I’m afraid you are.
Age hasn’t dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much, and luck hasn’t robbed me of so much of my fortune, and my bad ways haven’t deprived me of so many friends, that they won’t find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally, with money and friends at my disposal.
That’s a step in the direction of love.
So I’ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box—it’s like the gold that Midas couldn’t eat.
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do.
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty.
Ha, banishment?
Who treated you badly?
Myself?
I’m not dead?
Wicked woman, these white hairs you’re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing.
Get out, you dark-skinned gypsy!
He’s in Athens, my lord.
May God reward you for your kindness!
Foolish girl, in the eyes of most people this man’s a Caliban, and compared to him, they’re angels.
Here, noble lord.
Then young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts.
Don’t tell me that you’ve heard about this marriage, Friar, unless you can tell me how to prevent it.
Madam!
Romeo’s a dishcloth compared to him.
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint.
Your wives, your daughters, your old women, and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust.
We have to think about that.
Go take care of him.
Thank you, I’m sure.
Oh God, he’s murdered his master!
Whore, your lover’s dead now, and you’ll be going to hell soon.
If I ever see it, I will challenge you.
Well, well, you have a careful father, child.
It was a bit short, my lord.
What were those things?
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you.
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up, then I’ll lose my son twice.
I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile.
Go on.
Now, I swear, I’m so angry that I’m shaking all over.
Caesar.
They made more money and got more attention in the city.
There’s justice in heaven after all!
I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns.
It’s undeniable.
I don’t know any fancy ways of talking about love, only to say right out, “I love you.” If you press me any further than with the question, “Do you really?” my love scene is over.
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way, and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages, nothing taken that is not paid for, none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language.
I came here with a fool’s head on my shoulders and now I’m leaving with two.—Goodbye, sweet lady.
And all because I use my own money to make a profit.
Oh, well, stay till then!
No, he didn’t get any by me.
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and your words.
Let’s go back to court together, but 
Nobody’s that bad.
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them.
I have forgotten your name, but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly.
And here’s Regan, whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart.
No, I didn’t, but I did every night for the past year.
Everything’s fine now.
I’m neither, my lord.
Yes,” said my uncle Gloucester, “Small plants are graceful, while ugly weeds grow fast.” And since then, I’ve wished I wouldn’t grow so fast, because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry.
But I didn’t want you to think that I’m hasty in my emotions.
It’s too bad I’m so hard-hearted, because I really don’t love anyone.
What’s that supposed to mean?
The court awards it and the law authorizes it.
And now, let’s turn to our business with the French.
Well, I don’t.
I assure you it is, madam.
Go away and stay apart from me.
A good fool.
They all fell asleep together, as if they’d planned it.
Let’s go.
Talkers aren’t good doers.
With this ring I give them all to you.
A deed that will make sick men healthy.
I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him.
A rotten, foolish monster.
Favorably, except that there wasn’t enough time for his Grace to hear, as I sensed he would have liked to, the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France, and to the throne of France in general, through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather, Edward III.
But why, you villain, did you kill my cousin?
I wouldn’t think much of it even if it were heavier.
Therefore, tell me, what is he doing at sea?
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what’s tormenting me—how ungrateful my children are!
Then I’ll see you again?
Oh, but I’m worried.
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar.
Where’s that music coming from?
We haven’t been able to meet on a hill or in a valley, in the forest or a meadow, by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream, or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us.
They’ll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
What a horrible slut!
No, he’s an ordinary guy who ’s got a gentleman for a son, since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he’s achieved that distinction himself.
Don’t be shy—shake hands with me.
A sleeve?
Regan, is that what you said?
You know from my clothing who I am.
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks.
Stop, even if only to kill me.
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her, it’s true.
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm, they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him, lobby for him, or support him in any way.
From this moment on, I’ll never say another word.
When your mind is at peace, your body is sensitive to the elements.
And now they’re both gone.
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night.
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding.
I’m not sorry, either.
Man, they were asking for it.
My thanes and kinsmen, I name you all earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had.
All right, my lord.—How’s the king doing?
Here comes the Emperor.
I am one, my lord.
All you English princes, I salute you.
Your preparation for war sounds like something.    
Yes, my lord.
It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket.
That’s what we’re trying to say, sir.
I’m at your service, madam.
Lock the door.
That’s enough for the senate.
Actually, once or twice she sighed and said, “father,” as if the word were pressing on her chest.
No, sir, I won’t let you go.
Come on.
I don’t know her, but I know her father and he knew mine well.
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard.
Oh, in the duke of Gloucester’s wallet.
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat.
They are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight.
Don’t go near Casca.
Listen.
Perhaps there’s still some poison on them, to make me die with a medicinal kiss.
I guess you don’t want it.
When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him.
How are you, my ladies?
It must go like this.
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.
If I didn’t have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell.
How many months do you want?
Oh, the man who avenged her could ask anything of me!
What, we’re going to die?
Madam!
There’s some gentleman out there.— Good Sir Toby!
I’ll meet you there.
Oh, the poor man!
And I’ll turn you into a spirit like us, so you won’t die as humans do.—Come here, Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!
My father, led by a poor peasant?
I’ll be bitter toward him, and curt.
Pardon me?
Is the king leaving here today?
Look, sir, here comes the lady walking toward my cell.
It seems not.
The ghost is definitely something to worry about.
A fox you’ve trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered, If my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them.
I’m very sorry you’re not feeling well.  
I pulled it from his wound.
Come with me.
Boy!
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night.
You, sir, where’s my daughter?
This precious little guy is putty in your hands, Sir Toby.
You need to.
Hooray!
It’s you we were laughing at.
That makes me love you even more.
Will you be my husband, then?
It wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard.
But you’re all wound up about fashion, too.
Oh, my dear Cassio!
We’re going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer.
I sense you’re treating me like a child.
Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this.
Give me your torch, boy.
Calphurnia, my wife, is keeping me at home.
Good morning, noble sir.
I wouldn’t be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s kingdom and the riches of the East too.
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus.
Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away.
Not a chance!
How’s the prince?
Let’s speak to him.
It’s worse than murder to humiliate a king’s messenger like this.
Are you sick?
What, do you think we’re Turks or savages, instead of Christians?
That’s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world.
They’ll tell all.
Are you coming again for ransom?
My employer is as good as yours.
My mask is like the roof of the poor 
We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours.
Isn’t it strange?
And I am, I am.
You will not blame us in your funeral speech, but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission.
How’s the queen?
You’re not taking one step toward an enemy.
Cheers, boys.
I will have it all mine.
Oh angels, protect us!
When you’ve finished all this, return to the porch of Pompey’s theater, where you’ll find us.
Wake up the Montagues.
I’ll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour.
As for my wife, if only you had such a wife.
In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish.
It isn’t proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you.
I’m leaving your court now.
Then you’ll be able to cheer  If he were dead, what would happen to me?
You’re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul, you cruel Jew.
Please be careful.
Please tell me seriously what you think of her.
When I ran into this holy man, those men you mentioned did come to mind, in fact.
Who’s sleeping in the second chamber?
Yes, it is, I think.
Isn’t today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry Demetrius?
Gentlemen, calm down.
Go.
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money.
Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head.
Take me by the hand and say, “Harry of England, I am yours.” No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out, “England is yours, Ireland is yours, France is yours, and Harry Plantagenet
That’s very true, mangy rascal, when it pleases God.
Don’t say no.
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command.
Alright, then I’ll see you at Philippi.
She provides an excellent moral.
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings.
Will we be separated?
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.
I don’t know what you mean by that, but I’m sure Caesar fell down.
Aren’t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming?
Stay away for now, and good night, my sweet friend.
That’s “Ninus’s grave,” man.
If we’re like you in everything else, we’ll resemble you in that respect.
Halt!
And why are you noble, strong, and brave?
Romeo.
All cooped up together, just as you ordered, all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather.
For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men!
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe.
But let me hear the letter from your friend.
What soldiers, milk-face?
Send out more cavalry.
I folded up the new document, signed it, sealed it, and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference.
We want to hear it, Antony.
I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache.
I’ll chop her into pieces.
To tell you that you’ll see me at Philippi.
Tell me.
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
When all these extraordinary things happen at once, we shouldn’t say, “These happenings can be explained rationally.
I drink to you.
Please hire Cassio again.
You got me, I admit it.
She knew an old song called “Willow” that reminded her of her own story, and she died singing it.
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady’s good graces always reason themselves out again.
If you could only hear this testament—which, excuse me, I don’t intend to read aloud—you would kiss dead Caesar’s wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood, and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by.
God will take revenge.
Hello, sir.
I think I’ve found one already, thanks to you, my lord.
I’ll tell you this, Constable, my mistress has his own hair.
Don’t you know me still?
Here, I give you my blessing again.
Come on, can I get you two to make up?
You take out your sword too.
I wouldn’t marry her, even if she were as blessed as paradise.
If you forgive my mistake, I swear I’ll never break an oath with you again.
This is to feel the news, not hear it.
I’ll bet anything you like that nothing will happen, once again.
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here.
Sir, I know you, and I trust you enough to share something very important with you.
I’ll pay you for your trouble.
Ah, poor ghost!
I’ll bring you there.
You will be an accessory to both crimes.
Here’s another jacket to say thanks.
Not if the minor ones come up first.
Cesario, go visit that cruel Olivia one more time.
Get out of my sight!
Now, before the sun comes up and burns away the dew, I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers.
You don’t know?
My lady, should I lie in your lap?
I don’t have it with me.
The skin is good for your cracked head.
My belongings are on the ship already.
Let me see Philostrate.
I’m more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane.
Listen, if you want a good laugh—and I mean a side-splitting one—then follow me.
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury?
He’s changed a great deal.
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel, and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
And so, good morning to all of you.
A lovely, cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea, just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty.
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world? 
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy.
Who am I, sir?
I will die and leave Death everything.
I didn’t expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore.
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel.
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father.
Take it back.
Now he’ll work himself up to a fury.
Tom’s chilly.
Then certain ones.
Some  Now listen, either give me my ring or give me the necklace.
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest.
Please be quiet.
And they thought Margaret was Hero?
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other, though I have the gift of strength.
Our knocking woke him up.
And it’s all your fault.
Let’s have one, good soldier.
Then stay with us.
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome.
The duke is temperamental.
What are these things we’re looking at, my lord Antonio?
Let’s draw our own swords too.
Sir, he’s with Caesar.
I don’t think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight.
Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense.
I will say as much to his face.
There’s more knocking.
You are all    Lord of lords!
A piece of ice.
It’s a deal!
Tell me, is your tardy master close at hand?
Come on, be a man.
I doubt you’d thank me in the end, but she’s rich, all right, very rich.
You can refuse to make me your spouse, but I’ll be your servant whether you want me to or not.
Were you born here in the forest?
I don’t believe it.
Where, where?
Isn’t he the one who’s always,” and so on.
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun.
Yes, ma'am, we have.
Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon.
Or was I dreaming?
But this is bad!
Are you considering desertion, as well?
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them.
No!
Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this, out of duty and love?
And leave us, Publius, in case the people storming us should harm you.
He writes brave poems, speaks brave words, makes brave promises, and then breaks them just as bravely.
Here’s my key.
Cough them up.
Not in the stocks, fool.
Only describing what you have ruined.
What do you think of his neighbor, the Scottish lord?
I pity England, but not myself.
If he cannot, let the tailor mend him.
She is welcome to stay.
The gods know— Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been.
What have you found out?
I see you’re all eaten up with emotion.
So I can eat lunch.
I know I ought to obey my husband, but not now.
If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing.
Yes, my lord, but I can spoil it.
No, what provoked you was your own bloody mind, which never thinks about anything but butchering.
Oh, Regan, she’s torn me apart with unkindness, like a vulture, right here. 
Where else would she be?
I hear him mock Caesar’s luck, which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath.
Give me your hand, Roderigo.
When was the last time you saw my father?
Come on, let’s go at it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries, 'Stop!
I don’t think you’re treating me fairly.
It’s not because I don’t love you.
Good lord!
Pass on the command to halt!
And so, beautiful lady, I’m standing here just like that, wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is.
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me?
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies.
Hardly, Kate.
Follow your spirit, and as you charge cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”
If you pay too much attention to him you’ll make him angry, and that will make his convulsions go on longer.
I’m indebted to you.
If this letter’s right, you’ve got a lot to deal with.
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.
When the poor cried, Caesar cried too.
Here comes Catesby again.
Come down, brother.
My king says this: “Tell Harry of England: though we appeared dead, we were only asleep.
Did I do anything good to myself?
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo?
And then what would I do with him?
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter.
It’s a nice hazy feeling, so give in to it.
You could’ve done this without your beard and gown.
You should ask instead if it’s possible that any criminal could be so rich.
Or, rather, I’ll kill you, or I’ll do away with you, or I’ll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity.
Oh, Julius Caesar, you are still powerful.
Fool, speak well of yourself.
Hang on a minute—who are you?
Madam?
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio will guarantee it.
Iago has kept his word.
Where do you think he is now?
My soul is full of sorrow.
She’s the devil.
Why are they shouting?
And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena.
Sir, the king— Yes, what about him?
You’re a pustule, a sore, a tumor digesting my bloodline.
My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience.
My services are at your command.
I won’t speak to her.
Get me some ink, paper, and a candle.
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline.
Here come the lovers, laughing happily.—I wish you joy, my friends!
Ask your daughters for another one.
The king is insane.
Would I ever deny you anything?
Father, this isn’t easy for me.
I’m no less noble than you are, Edmund.
Send your man away.
Or any of you?
No, definitely not!
What can I do for you, madam?
I have come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
No.
I drew my sword to part them.
I’ll have to do something courageous then, because I hate intrigue.
Or at least that’s what I plan to do before I let you go.
Cesario, come here.
Good night, good brother.
Well, I’m sorry for your niece.
With no more ceremony than that?
And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command.
Young man, excuse me, how do I get to the Jew’s?
I bet it’s a challenge.
What’s all that shouting about?
Good point, Decius.
But there’s more work to be done.
Now heaven has her.
I leave him to you.
Let’s start.
But you’ll have to catch me!
That’s what you get for marrying Christian husbands.
Thursday it is, then. 
What income, what profit does it bring in?
Where’s lady Portia?
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run in the streets as though it were doomsday.
You may hear about it soon.
Truly, no—no more than is reasonable.
And if you treat us badly, won’t we try to get revenge?
My Lord of Warwick, a most corrupt treason—God be praised for it!—has been discovered, as plain as any you’d hope to see on a summer’s day.
You, niece.
Then patiently listen to my impatience.
Oh Lord, they’re fighting!
Should we see what he thinks?
Oh ho, is that what you’re getting at?
The Moor himself is still at sea.
I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company, sir.
Do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here?
Is everyone here?
Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours.
He was dressed like a hunter.
I’ll reward treason with blows, I promise you.
My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes!
Give me your hand, and explain your situation to me.
Are you gone like that, my love, my lord?
I’ve promised to make everything right.
I don’t think so.
Be patient, madam.
Have you killed Tybalt?
I’ll give you frets!” With that, she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through,
I’ll do so.
EPHESUS Now what do you think?
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier?
The storm separated us.
He’s not sick, my lord, but he’s very upset, and his problems are serious.
At least I’ve got some booze to comfort me.
You’re not asleep yet, sir?
No, after you.
Signior Benedick served well in the war, my lady.
Tell him I want to speak with him.
If I don’t love her, I’m completely 
Good morning to all these lovely people.
Then lead the way, father.
If she’s cheated on me, then heaven itself is a fake.
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders.—Put his legs in the stocks.
Swords don’t frighten me.
So go out there and give him what he wants.
Good Macbeth, we’re ready when you are.
Who’s there?
He can’t go in there because of the candle.
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn.
Leave now.
Good-bye, until you return tonight.
And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you.
Everything’s ready.
My only sin was loving you too much.
Cobweb.
Carry him away.
Forty thousand brothers, if you added all their love together, couldn’t match mine.
Welcome, my lord.
I swear on my life I won’t tell your secret.
No, lovely princess.
The brilliant Sir Topas!
Love?
Let me wipe it off first.
Please take them off.
Whatever you want—I made it for you.
Don’t you see that I’m out of breath?
Well, it certainly wasn’t true for Richard!
Thursday is coming.
Lord, how painful it was to drown.
But I never spoke the whole time?
Miranda.—Oh father, I’ve disobeyed you by telling him that!
Be sad only at the fact that you’ll lose your friend—your friend doesn’t regret that he paid your debt.
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily—and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully, when I had no reason to speak of you at all. 
I’ll be thrilled.
Now, I swear by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too, he will not make me a joyful bride there.
Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved.
No, if you struggle with me— Just half an hour!
Run, master, run.
Ruining his meals, his enjoyment, and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad.
Do you know who I am?
If you close the doors on a woman’s wit, it’ll fly out the window.
To our house.
I’ll read it to you.
What has Caesar done to deserve your love?
Fast asleep?
Am I Dromio?
We have not betrayed you.
Go, blockheads, go, and bring my supper to me.  
Armed forces have already landed.
Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly.
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions.
We know each other’s faces, but as for our thoughts, he doesn’t know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his—or you do about mine.
I will, my lord.
I’ll take the Queen into my custody.
Gone?
Oh, you’re a naughty one, encouraging double-dealing.
Quiet, quiet, Iras.
Don’t take too long, unless you want our king to come after me to ask what’s holding things up, because he’s already landed here.
Oh, by this count I’ll be many years older before I see my Romeo again.
What does she say, madam interpreter?
So pardon him, dear father, for my sake.
What I’m saying can’t anger him.
Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy!
She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover, and now that she’s getting married to Theseus, you’ve come to celebrate their marriage.
Never.
I am a gentleman of a company.
From soldiers.
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words.
Yes, I do, lady.
Sir Topas!
That day will never come.
Dear sister, it’s unfair to me—and unfair to yourself—to turn me into a slave.
Run off, go visit fairs and festivals!
Our hour is up.
If it’s the same one— If it’s the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong.
Don’t trouble him further until his mind is more settled.
This much I can say about him: he is well-born, has proven his bravery in battle, and has established his good character.
So could I.
Take me to the edge of it, and I’ll reward all your troubles with something valuable.
Every subject’s duty is the king’s, but every subject’s soul is his own.
He smiled and said, “The better for us.” He’s right, and that’s how it is.
Take care.
Come on.
They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans.
There’ll be hell to pay for this.
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello.—You whorehouse-keeper.
Most powerful lord, my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you.
They vanished strangely.
Smile, then, on this beautiful union.
Have you told him all her faults, Hortensio?
Come on, Antonio.
Orsino.
What’s the matter?
Oh, that’s a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin, from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard.
It looks like these witches are scared of swords.
Here’s to you!
Don’t be afraid.
Lorenzo will be happy with what we’ve done.
Give me the gown.
What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed!
What’s wrong?
You lie.
My man Grumio!
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last.
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it.
Can we have some water please here?— Come and wash, Kate, make yourself at home.
I hope to God he keeps his promise!
We’ll speak again tomorrow.
This just may cheer me up.
Pull off my beard?
So stay for a while.
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight.
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey.
You may as well undertake to be hanged.
She’s gone.
If the witches tell the truth—which they did about you—maybe what they said about me will come true too.
Yes.
Ugly, wrinkled witch, what are you doing here?
I have more reason to be distressed.
Were you listening to these verses?
I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.” They’re retreating.
I swear to her that I haven’t, but it doesn’t change anything.
Nothing, except your true love for my lord.
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy—your mother can vouch for that—and then he was betrothed to Bona, the King of France’s sister-in-law.
Promise me you’ll let me live, and I’ll confess the truth.
I want to drink your health.
You are, but you don’t know it yet.
What’s happening to me, that I’m frightened of every noise?
As I said before, Antonio will guarantee the loan.
How is my wife?
To die for adultery?
Your horn is a foot long, and I’m at least that size.
But you must learn to recognize such liars, or you will be greatly taken advantage of.
She’s not good enough for you, then.
You were right the first time.
That’s authority!
An awful monster!
I am nothing but a poor, used fool.
I’ve never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets.
But if you’d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first, I’ll watch your arrow more carefully this time.
They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together.
Yes, but who is he?
What’s the news among the merchants?
Are you dreaming or awake?
Groan?
Goodbye.
Go to your tomb!
No, calm down.
But now it’s stopped.
The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near.
The rooster has already crowed twice.
Haven’t you, boy?
But it’s no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown—a head, I mean—and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping.
He could never bear carnation.
Where’s my fool?
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest, I’d be wise enough to satisfy myself.
But don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you.
What do you want with her, sir?
If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her.
Come along, though.
Where is that knocking coming from?
Run to the Capulets.
Can’t you talk?
Where are my good fellows?
That will please God, who has him now.
I’ve lost my name and title to a traitor.
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over.
Even the best jewel can be tarnished.
But I’m a hired hand: I don’t profit from the flocks I tend.
I’d obey even if she were my mother ten times over.
Well, that’s what you get to do.
But if
Well, you’re not on target there.
Bassanio, we’ll say goodbye for now, since you’ve found Antonio.
My brother, your uncle Antonio—just listen to this (I still can’t believe a brother could be so disloyal!
If you survive, I’ll live.
Forever and a day.
Please treat my babies well.
It’s women crying, my good lord.
That’s definitely true, my lord.
This repays me.
Why, sir, he’s not coming.
Three thousand ducats.
So, in God’s name, let’s march.
Your brother’s right-hand man.
Here, sir!
Or at least I can describe the rumors.
I’m not insulting you.
I’ll get it done right away.
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity.
My husband?
Will you marry her?
Catesby.
Oh, noble sir!
I never hurt you.
Make him think you’re Sir Topas the priest.
He’s coming, ma'am.
So we should eat and drink.
Now is the time when we need your help.
You know where I live.
What in the world do you call this, tailor!
For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed.
Oh no, sir, I won’t let him go, sir, not without a good reason.
I’m going now.
Is this true?
We still have hope. 
Like a young man who wants to amount to something, this morning begins early.
You weren’t given any gold?
He’s too overwhelmed with shame.
Let me take my chances.
Definitely a tailor, sir.
Oh, Tranio, what a cruel father he is.
My worthy Cawdor!
I guess this is not a fish, but a native who got struck by lightning just now.
Truly, madam, I don’t hear anything.
Let thunder rumble!
It’s too bad.
Go ahead, then.
Can you ask around and find out?
I saw it in the orchard.
They’re lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving.
A conclusion, a conclusion: he is in love.
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight.
I don’t know what you mean, madam.
Look, look!
He’s definitely drunk now.
Alas, my lord, your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom.
Where did we leave off?
What’s the matter?
Lend me your cloak, Sir Thomas.
I’m glad about that.
I am no villain.
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky.
I see you like to make big offers, sir.
If she can’t find out what his secret is, then send him off to England or wherever you think best.
Is your name Shylock?
Meanwhile, I’ll get Sir Toby.
Very well, my supreme lord—that’s what I have to call you now.
Even the fragile wren, the smallest of birds, will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest.
Yes, heavily.
Go to sleep, and listen to us laughing.
Let’s go!
Come, come, you’re making fun of me.
Yes, but not out of fear.
But you have to.
I’ll give you more instructions later.
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself.
I might come back soon.
Then be so kind as to show them in.
This is the silliest thing I’ve ever seen.
O, everlasting shame!
Your son is crazy.
Well, he’ll be dead, so he won’t see anything.
You tie up horses by their heads, dogs and bears by their necks, monkeys by their waists, and humans by their legs.
And I will give you some more.
That’s no lie.
If he’s as good as a saint but is black like a devil, I’d rather he hear my confession than marry me.
No more about that, please.
All right.
May the devil turn you black, you white-faced fool!
My lord and brother, God save you.
I’m the king himself.
Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it.
But here comes Antony.
And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to.
That since she’s mad herself, she’s married a madman.
I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk.
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books.
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay, your conscience will fly out?
I’ll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it.
So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it.
Well, death is the end for everybody.
Thanks for your trouble.
The highest-ranking?
That dirty rat!
My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together.
I have an adventurous fairy who’ll go seek out the squirrel’s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts.
They’re entirely welcome.
It’s not safe to be straightforward and honest.
Which one of you killed the deer?
Oh, be quiet.
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell.
Though I wish you were dead, I’m not going to be the one to kill you.
A crown was offered to him, and he pushed it away with the back of his hand, like this—and then the people started shouting.
In an instant we were separated from them, as if in a dream, and brought here in a daze.    
I believe it.
Didn’t I turn down the page where I left off reading?
What should I do?
I’d say the same thing, but I’m afraid I’d be faced out of my way.
I told them to take  Oh, what a big mistake!
And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor.
Ah, there’s the problem.
Not a bit, madam.
I’m Christopher Sly.
Father, what’s the news?
Oh sweet Nurse, what news do you bring?
Even though she’s as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another, still… I know what I know.
You’re talking about killing?
But don’t you see what a    Did you hear someone?
The point is that she didn’t write this letter.
Now there can only be the promise.
Everyone.
I’ll pretend to be the housewife for once.
It was me, no one else.
But please, father—the question is still nagging at me—why did you conjure up this storm?
Madam, that young man out there says he’s got to speak to you.
Do you even get what I’m saying?
Farewell.
Don’t tug on my clothes.
Get off the field, my lord.
Yes, leeks are good.
One of you run to the Queen with the news.
Please, corporal, stop!
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order.
Then we’ll see that tomorrow night.
Sir, do you recognize this glove?
What’s going on?
It’s not yet daylight.
Don’t you have any respect for anything?
Oh, I’ve been murdered unfairly!
I’m not asking you to call her.
If you thought that you’d be thinking too much.
Now, Charmian!
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—Hello, Ophelia.
What are you going to do?
I’m sorry.
Let’s be angry only long enough to do the deed, and then let’s act like we’re disgusted by what we had to do.
Come on.
If that’s true, it’s a serious fault, and Caesar has paid seriously for it.
Everyone says you can’t make up your mind.
Please stay below deck, sir.
Whenever I mention him, praise him more than any man deserves.
All is lost!
Calphurnia!
I’m coming, slut!
Whatever we decide to do.
Why has all this been put on the table?
My lord, I have thought over the request you just made of me.
Three thousand ducats, hmmm.
Madam, you’ve treated me badly, very badly.
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors.
I’m serious, I can’t.
You shouldn’t talk about him like that!
She would make a good wife for Benedick.
Most formidable Queen!
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this?
Stop, brave lady, stop!
It would be better if they were all on his father’s side, or that there were none at all on his father’s side.
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night.
Let’s shake on it.
I’m everywhere.
Get out of my sight!
Madam.
And what’s her story?
He will die.
Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships.
I’m going, I’m going.
You worthless man!
That’s where hell is, and darkness, and fires and stench!
Everyone, please leave us alone for a moment.
Were these things we’re talking about really here?
Run as if your life depended on it.
Oh, I wish I had my rosary!
Leave me.  
Well, sir, and you, witty lady, who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk, my name is Vincentio, my hometown Pisa, and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven’t seen in a long while.
That’s a good one.
Yes, but these English are seriously short of beef.
A drunkard or a corpse?
Why, the he that will marry this woman.
God, I’m crazy about her.
Hands, speak for me!
I won’t consider it.
My dearest sister!
Some of them are leaning already.
Relent?
Leave me, my friend.
The gown was made just as my master was directed.
My wife’s coming.
Oh, I wish you’d never been born!
Talk to the ambassadors who’ve just come back: ask them how majestically he responded to their message, how well supplied he was with good advisors, how restrained in expressing his displeasure, and, moreover, how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve.
Not of killing him, because I have a warrant for it, but of being damned for killing him, which no warrant can protect me from.
Claudio deserves to be honored, and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly.
What about Stanley?
Oh, gods, make me worthy of this noble wife!
I like him very well.
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story.—Please go stand farther away.
My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price: death.
Then get to work, poison!
Goodbye, Edmund.
Bring him with us.
Away, get out of here.
Then come to my house tomorrow morning, and since you couldn’t be my son-in-law, be my nephew instead.
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior.
She’s beautiful, if my eyes can see.
Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for.
Peter!
Well, that’s what he’s doing—making you free to enjoy heaven.
Welcome to Elsinore.
His military ability is double that of the other two.
Exactly how long is that, do you think?
Get out of my sight.
In the time since he left Egypt, he could have traveled an even longer distance.
Yes, I remember.
I’ll show you how kind I am.
I know him well.
There’s no other way.
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one, you would have a million children.
I  Let’s not break the law by starting a fight.
What did he do when you saw him?
Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight.
Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.
Where’s your lute?
Didn’t you hear their shouts?
No, it would be impossible.
Say what you’re here for.
Just let me say one prayer!
Gone, sir.
You’ll fight with a man who’s cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes.
Look in the almanac.
My father can’t think straight—a hundred knights!
Your Majesty is quite right.
Is that the latest we can do it?
Everyone else, march on with me.
Yes, she said that.
Out of love?
Yeah, right—you sent me to get whipped.
It’s good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin.
He’s too good to have any compassion for you.
And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you—write.
I’ll drink later.
Alas, our poor country!
I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in.
Trinculo, if you interrupt him any more, I swear I’ll knock some teeth out of your head.
What kind of beard should I wear for the part?
He said, “Remember me.” I swore I would.
Some men don’t like roast pig, others go crazy if they see a cat, and others can’t help urinating when they hear bagpipes.
All right, then.
No, really, I’m not.
The Lord in heaven bless you, noble Harry!
And as for what I promised to you, I’m as good as my word.
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind, made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water.
Well, Juliet, I’ll lie with you tonight.
It is not destiny’s fault, but our own faults, that we’re slaves.
Send me away?
I tell you, I’ll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing.—Go on, bite.
Don’t be afraid, even though you see me with a weapon.
Take it, brave York.
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break.
Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine.
He refuses, as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God.
I’m surprised my bland husband didn’t meet me on the way here.
I’m sure his majesty will recover his health soon.
It may be so.
I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness.
Wish I could say the same.
Is that possible?
I’ll give it to him.
Pretty York, who told you about his teeth?
Here’s more news.
There’d be no kingship— He wants to be king in a place with no kingship.
She is our principal demand—one of the first points of the treaty.
Therefore, I beg your Highness, pardon me.
Then tell them to treat us well.
I would’ve been a sore king then.
Put it together with something else.
It was addressed to him, and orders must be obeyed.
to wage war.
That braggart, punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual!
You must not go without having a drink first.
But there’s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster.
I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation.—Some music, please, and, good friend, sing.
It persuades you and discourages you.
I’ve heard a lot more.
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself.
But what if my answer’s no?
What are you going to do?
Please call him and tell him to come back here.
Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth.
Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place.
You said the enemy wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions.
Oh Ratcliffe, I had a terrifying dream!
Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad?
Didn’t I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you?
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently, and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs.
God have mercy, Grumio!
Oh, you villain!
What, like stuff from a house?
I think so too.
I will.
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.
He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy.
We’ve all come out to see what will happen.—Go, Hercules!
Have the excavators stopped work?
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb.
Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning.
Give me my sin back.
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace.
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished.
Wake up, wake up!
But thinking like this won’t help me choose a husband.
No, instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions.
It’s partly my own fault, since I followed you here.
A fortunate coincidence—more fortunate for your son.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, unfit for toil and trouble in the world, if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way did he run?
You’re older than me.
You’re up early.
He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff.
And a true lover of the holy Church.
I felt like skipping school, sir.
A simple country farmer who brought her figs.
Let’s go to this great feast.
And so far I’m pleased with the way things have turned out, since I find all of this commotion very entertaining.
After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart.
Oh, it’s too terrible.
No, none that you’re smart enough to make.
I hope you’re an expert in your field.      
Let the ship sail close to the wind.
It’s not true because she separates us.
There’s a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman.
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you.
I know he holds me dear, but I haven’t asked him about the coronation, and he hasn’t told me.
What do you think?
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself, when you don’t give any now?
Honestly, I can’t.
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry.
And mine say a hundred and forty.
Get out of here, you horrible ghost, you hallucination.
Likewise, I’m young, and my sense of reason has just ripened.
Oh, my lord!
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes.
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence, and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do.
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me.
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love.
Where did she die?
Listen to my excuse.
I carry no hatred, holy man, because my request will benefit my enemy.
Yeah, that would get every single one of us executed.
The sailors are all below deck, sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them.
Your father was an extremely moral man, and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds.
Come on, let’s go see King Edward.
Cleopatra— How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia?
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues.
It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques.
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers.
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved.
I don’t think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning.
On that point, our letters don’t agree.
It’s like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing.
Where should we go?
I’ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales.
It’s better to act virtuously rather than vengefully.
Let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions truthfully.
Which of these bad things happened to him?
Macbeth.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
Do you hear what I say, lady?
I’m here.
Somebody’s knocking.
A fine ship, with some good people in it, I’m sure, smashed to pieces.
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
Sorry, sir?
Ha, ha!
Here I’m kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me, either by thoughts or actions, or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else, or if I never did love him, or don’t love him now—even though he tries to shake me off—
What’s going on, Borachio?
They killed your wife, your children, your servants, anyone they could find.
Everything that belongs to them is yours.
What endeavor, Popillius?
No, not at all.
Oh cowardly conscience, how you’re torturing me!
Who’s coming?
Good God, I was about to say something.
Go on, take them.
Then he shook Bassanio’s hand affectionately—and they separated.
Oh you damned villain!
Be gone!
I tell you, you would find the rituals of war and, I promise you, its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise.
Leonato, am I standing here?
Royal Egypt, Empress!
I’ll ask them.
Let me say first, madam, that he is well.
Listen to many people, but talk to few.
It’s your music, madam, from your house.
Actually I think I would, and then I’d undo it after I did it.
Who are the people who want to speak with me?
But I won’t sleep till I get back.
I have a wife I love.
You’ll get a blow from me for that, I think.
Trust me, you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck.
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom.
But let him start off easy by killing one of us.
What do you think, will my friends prove loyal?
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him.
I am unfit to rule and to be king.
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love.
What’s up, my man?
Oh, Fate, come and cut the thread of my life.
So be quiet.
And you,  And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
Cassio doesn’t know you.
Quiet!
I gave him no order.
But let me see, by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen.
I know my medicine will work on him.
I’ll get free of you.
Friends, go.
It’s true.
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house.
What, is today a holiday?
I don’t feel anything.
But since this has happened, you should fix it for your own good.
I would like to prove to you that I am.
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do.
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero.
I remember this fellow—he once played the eldest son of a farmer.
It’s still warm from the cut.
We rejoice to see you, most worthy brother of England.
And the boys are winning so far?
He’s not jealous?
No, you can’t sign a contract like that for me!
Caesar, I never believed in omens, but now they frighten me.
That’s already been done, sir.
Leave.
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war.
Donalbain.
Say, isn’t this the Latin master Cambio?
But still, my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea.
You!
It’s true, they’re inconsistent.
You’re a villain!
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land.
Soldiers, sir.
Hello, sir.
Who says he is?
He’s flabby and out of breath.—Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead.
I’ve had enough of this “off with you!” Come on, let me in!
Say something, man!
When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die.
Ever since I arrived here, just now, I’ve been hearing strange rumors.
Yes, and don’t let anyone come in, or else I’ll break your head.
But if you fail, you have to leave immediately.
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars.
It’s his wife, Lady Grey, who got him to do this.
Yes, and his relative, too.
I’ll moan very believably.—Name the other actors.—But I’m really in the mood to play a tyrant.
Or is he walking?
I’m a gentleman.
I will, my liege.
My lord?
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place.
Hope with good cause is swift; it flies as fast as a swallow.
And now who but you knows whether I’m yours?
Stay there and fortify it well against the French.
You’re right.
And he would have deserved it too.
Blab my nonsense!
But what’s the upshot of her admiration?
rules my life.” Hmm, let me see, let me see, let me see.
Please put that log down and rest a while.
Did you hear a noise?
Fool, fool, hey, fool!
Most mighty sovereign, you have no reason to doubt my friendship.
Who’s there?
I won’t say no to you, but let it be known that I’m only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life —I hear you were quickly wasting away without me.
Good man, why are you crying?
All right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely.
You can’t blame anyone for it anyone, I say.
Flee?
Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused.
Don’t believe in this.
Who are these people?
Get on your way and hire those horses.
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you, when he loves you so deeply?
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge.
Tranio, let’s go.
Where could I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia?
Stop right there!
Yes, sir.
My sweet husband, I did not lock you out.
Is everything ready for that event?
Was a man ever beaten as much as me?
On the condition that your sister’s son, Publius, also must die, Mark Antony.
Oh, Antony, you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold!
And this is what you told me he said: that he beat you and pretended his house wasn’t his and I wasn’t his wife.
Oh righteous God, how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother’s children and forces her to join others in their grief!
When I was putting on the Ceres show, I thought of reminding you about Caliban, but I was afraid of upsetting you.
He’s afraid to come in.
Your case is better than that.
Is that possible?
Lord Hastings, you and he are close.
Are you wise?
The boy is warning me that someone approaches.
They’ll assume that Cicero, with his sound judgment, ordered the actions.
I’m going to rest my head on this little slope.
I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed.
I’ll run away from you and hide in the bushes, and leave you to the mercy of wild animals.
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous—they all mean the same thing, with some variation.
Welcome.
Dear gods, bless this couple, since you’re the ones who have shown us the path that led us here.
Come out, you frightened man.
Now any effort ruins what it attempts.
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind, and when they fall, they shatter into pieces.
Why do you need twenty-five knights, or ten, or even five, when you’re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service?
Hello, brother Edmund.
hundred times.
For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl!
Come over here.
The ground is bloody.
The things men do daily, not knowing what they’re doing!
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours.
When I raise my hand, you do the same, and bring it down on Gonzalo’s head.
My daughter is still very young.
Let him become Caesar!
Where?
Damn your wine!
And he deserves it, having been excellent before he had a reputation for it.
A cat in heat will look for a mate, And Rosalind certainly will too.
Should we go inside?
We’re being haunted.
A likely story!
But you don’t love me.
When will he be here?
Yes, good idea; that’s the 
How wonderful my master is!
What about it?
They howl about banishment.
For himself to ruin,” he says.
Look after my goods and possessions.
Oh, sad day!
Go, coward that you are.
Look, it’s the Prince and Mr. Love.
It’s clear, every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death.
I’m afraid the people have made Caesar their king.
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it, nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated.
My honor wasn’t given; it was only dominated.
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying?
Mutton?
You know too much about suffering.
We’re absolutely not here to delight you.
Yes, if you want to help yourself.
Is there any more, or is that it?
No sir, trust me, I do not.
These are the messengers from my sister and the king.
No doubt, no doubt.
I hear that Edgar, Gloucester’s exiled son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.
Villain, you don’t know the laws of God or of man.
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract, and I’ll go get the money for you right away.
Lay off, already!
If I have killed your children, I will have children with your daughter.
If you read this, Caesar, you might live.
Oh, the things men dare to do!
Keep beating, my heart, and muscles, don’t grow old yet—keep me standing.
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven.
What do you think you’re doing?
Leave him alone.
Fruits and vegetables don’t ripen until the right season of the year.
Oh, I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio, than have lived through that terrible day!
It’s dinnertime, my lord.
Give me my fan, Peter.
She’s always talking when I want to sleep.
I don’t know his name.
It’s now late at night, and actions must accommodate bodily needs, which we’ll satisfy with only a short rest.
But why aren’t you in your shop today?
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation.
You’re like one of those guys who walks into a bar, slams his sword on the table, and then says, “I pray I never have to use you.” By the time he orders his second drink, he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all.
Take a tip from me, then.
But it’s true—I don’t want to get all mushy and go on and on, but the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—oh, if I only had a title good enough to match his!— Come on, get to the point.
Is Scotland the same as when I left it?
Kind and dear princess!
They’ve eaten themselves sick.
If she admits she wanted this, then I won’t blame Othello.—Come here, my child.
Is this your idea of success?
Why, that man is a total fraud and rascal.
I’m right behind you.
I’ll lie here tonight.
Yes, my lord, if you would like.
So I’m free.
You force me to read the will, then?
My dear Miss Chat-her-up, I look forward to getting to know you better.
I wish I were as big and strong as you.
Find him and tell him to come here.
She’s ready to go, but she’ll never return. 
It’s not lost, but what if it were?
Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it.
First of all, my house in the city, as you know, is filled with expensive furniture and household articles, china and gold, basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in.
I’ll do everything she wants me to do.
He’s a king, a king!
Are these spirits we see before us?
It’s true.
All right.
But that’s not how you’re going to be.
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great!
Get going already.
Give me some comfort, Nurse.
If you wish.
No, girl!
What is it, my lord?
He’ll never follow anything that other men have started.
Well, old man, I’ll tell you news of your son.
Good Lord, what a clown you are!
This is your job.
Off with his son George’s head!
A nice, soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France’s hard, cold ground.
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever, hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother’s lament.
You mean their  Cut off their heads, take their maidenheads—whatever.
Well, then, what should we do for fun instead?
Oh!
Do it now.
Have mercy, Jesus!—Wait, I was only dreaming.
I know that he’ll be on our side.
you will  And what if he won’t stop?
I’ll 
What did he tell you, Ophelia?
Where’s the king?
I don’t want to play now.
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before.
Little” again?
Yes, he will, and the queen as well.
Can’t you see I’m eating?
Stop!
I’ve got the whole barrel, man.
All right!” It’s not fine, and I’m not all right!
But since your father doesn’t want him to marry you, you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man.
All right Ursula, as Beatrice arrives, we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick.
I’ll do it, if you help me out.
Conscience,” I say, “you give good advice.” “Devil,” I say, “you give good advice.” If I listened to my conscience, I’d stay with the Jew my master, who’s a devil.
I’m not afraid of dead uncles.
Goodbye.
Therefore tell me, fairest Katherine, will you have me?
He’s pale and hyperventilating, as if a bear were chasing him.
We’re wandering in a maze.
He is.
That’s good, if he’ll really do it.
I’ve separated them into groups around the island, just as you ordered.
Please do.
Le Roy?
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin.
Where’s the necklace?
I love him dearly, and I shall continue to favor him.
If that were true, then I’d know your secret.
Go and wiggle your ears!
You’re so attractive when you smile.
But I beg you, don’t interpret my suspicions as slander against you.
Is he there in person?
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me, but I’m working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor.
As a matter of fact, if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe’s belt, it would have been a very good tragedy.
Where are those bastards?
That’s excellent.
I don’t have anywhere to go, so I don’t need to see.
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to “make peace with God,” but you’re willing to go to war with God by murdering me?
Get out of here, you measly, lying wretch.
So now everyone will point at me and say, “Look, there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio—if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing!”  
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments.
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated.
I don’t know.
I’ll bet we’re both thinking the same thing, master.
My lord, good morning.
Don’t greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes.
Malvolio’s coming down the path.
Right on cue, here’s the duke himself.
Speak, if you can.
My husband is dead.
Alright, I will.
I will, my lord.
Come to my room later on.
Demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you.
How are you, my pretty Bianca?
I would have made it short.
You don’t have to worry about any of these lords, my lady.
You’ll find me ready enough to do that, sir, if you give me a reason.
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business, and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return.
I will do so.
What a fearful night this is!
I assure you he can.
That’s what she was expecting, and you let her down.
It’s fair for him to treat me like this, very fair.
Is it four o'clock?
The Egyptian flagship, the  Gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them!
But he’s got to build churches for that to happen, my lady, or else he’ll have to put up with being forgotten, like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes, “Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, the hobby-horse is forgotten.”   What does this mean, my lord?
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage.
Tell us, Othello.
He does hear me, and that makes me cry.
The bridegroom is already here.
And how did you get in here?
I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona.
Come with me and let me advise you.
No, advancement to the dignity and height of honor, to a high, imperial kind of glory.
It used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die, and that would be it.
Jesus, he’s an ass if there ever was one!
Count Claudio, when do you plan to go to church and be married?
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake.
My granddaughter, with her kind aunt, the duchess of Gloucester, leading her by the hand?
Listen up, uncle.
The night’s too rough for humans to bear.
Let me just ask her one question, and by your authority as her father, order her to answer truthfully.
A wonderful miracle!  
The wind is right and it’s high tide, and I’ve delayed him a long time already.
I’m old and foolish.
Please allow her to do this.
Stop her!
Indeed, they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow, and he’ll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy.
Tell me truthfully, do you love my sister?
Those who rush stumble and fall.
Duke, please go ahead with your state business.
I’ll drink it if I like.
Go on.
Well, do whatever you think best.
How are you, Malvolio?
This lantern represents the moon.
Farewell.
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn’t have!
You haven’t heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, but look how drunk I am.
God, help us not be jealous!
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again.
I long to be immortal.
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman, that’s certain, one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare, I happen to know from his maneuvers.
No, because my manly heart is grieving.
You must all keep up this united front.
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
Please, let me review the contract.
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts.
Hurry up, or I’ll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn.
He’ll never agree to that.
You haven’t got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do.
Please don’t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly.
I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you.
Yes, very well, sir.
He answered, “You penniless bastard!
I think Belman is just as good, my lord.
Who’s taken over the watch for you?
I’ll do what I can, more than I’d do for myself.
I know how his mind works.
I’m dying to see the prince.
Now, herald, have the dead been counted?
I wish that were true for both our sakes!
To the field!
Are you behind some bush?
It’s good we had this meeting.
Just do it carefully.—And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished, for the crime of telling the truth!
My own flesh and blood rebels against me!
You imply that married men are fools.
But please tell me, is my boy—God rest his soul—alive or dead?
Did he get away clean?
For now, don’t try to persuade me anymore—I ask you as a friend.
Yes, do that.
Is that why you’re talking so wildly?
Why, friends, you don’t even know what you’re doing yet.
Octavius, lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field.
Pardon me but I do not know what is “like me.” An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Look, here comes just the man we were looking for.
Please, Emilia, ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight.—
Listen, Signor Bassanio, there’s nothing to worry about.
Take your seat.
I am.
Now, if courtiers were shepherds, that kind of courtesy would be unclean.
You are building your nest in 
Just listen to him.
Othello, have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you.
I thought the clouds were talking to me, the winds were singing to me, and the thunder, like an awful organ pipe, roared Prospero’s name.
All hail, Macbeth!
They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart.
What’s going on?
He’s very handsome.
Lady Beatrice is angry with you.
What are you doing?
You’ll be sorry later, but it’ll be too late. 
What do you have to say to me now?
Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!
I never talked with her in my life.
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine.
Second, he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies.
My good lord— You’ve always been a liar.
Seek!
The reason is that it’s what I want.
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet.
My clerk has some comforting news for you, too.
Delighted to stay?
No, villain, but you didn’t work alone.
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown.
Good night, dear Captain Blunt.
Come and see the proof.
Sir, I’m half-blind.
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter?
We’re off to eat and whoop it up at your father’s house.
You will, my lord.
Why, what symptoms of love does she exhibit?  
When you see leeks in the future, I hope you keep mocking them.
Mercutio, be quiet.
Something’s wrong.
You’re most welcome.
You had a Clarence, too, and Richard killed him.
Do you really think there’s a man fool enough to marry into hell—however rich the father is?
Here comes the Prince and Claudio.
It’s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men.
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts, you’re the one who gave the order.
Be pointed and brief.
No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain.
But you’ve seen her and Cassio together.
Stop, Sir Toby!
Weren’t we both born under Taurus?
Yes, but the clerk will never do it, unless he grows up to be a man.
He’ll just think an idiot wrote it.
I couldn’t go to Mantua because I was stuck there.
Oh Margaret, Margaret, your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastings’s miserable head!
Goodbye.
I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best.
I’m happiest of all that I’m yours now, my lord, my king, and you can guide me as you wish.
Is that the law?
Give her this key, and tell her that there’s money in the desk that’s covered with a Turkish tapestry.
Didn’t I tell you she was innocent?
Sir, I’m puzzled by what you just said.
Isn’t every living thing condemning her?
Here are forty ducats.
You’ll fight with him eventually, and  The duke, my father, loved his father very much.
Is he married?
Good luck, fair gentleman.
Then if they’re negligent, we could control them.
You certainly made me believe you did, my lord.
That’s it—I’m done.
I don’t want anything more.
All of them?
I am the greatest, but I was able to do the least.
Please, young sir.
I didn’t love you.
Amen.
If you weren’t my brother, I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this.
It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to do.
Go now, and pretend to be a friendly hostess.
I humbly thank you, sir.
He was a wreck, almost past hope.
He is a subject for a king to contemplate, and for a king’s king to ride on, and for the world at large—both friend and stranger—to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at.
A gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him—these are the two fools I need for my plan to work.
No, madam.
What are you fighting about?
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Only for poor men?
I heard the news, my lord.
You’ve offered an excellent interpretation.
It’s a good tragedy, very well done.
I wish she were in love with me instead.
Don’t refuse the love we offer you.
When we were alone, we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant.
What blessed work, my king.
No one, Brutus, no one.
Farewell, lady.
The door is open, sir.
You’re right, Charmian.
Show us the way, sir.
Caesar is in a sober mood.
Maybe?
So you don’t love me?
The sight of them is offensive.
You can have a whole story, not just a word.
Please, who?
Even my tears burn me like molten lead.
But please tell me, can you read anything you see?
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep, “Help, someone!
What soldiers, fool?
The mayor is here at hand.
However, this is an extreme situation, and it’s more important to control it than to worry about how you’ll look.
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship.
I’ll read you a sermon.
You think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin.
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you.
I’m not scared of you.
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now.
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt.
Along the way, I’ll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen’s proud relatives, as step one in the plan we’ve discussed.
Decius Brutus doesn’t love you.
I wish my eyes were 
How long have you believed in astrology?
Jacob didn’t have any control over what happened.
You can be married tomorrow if you want.
If the other two are as loopy as we are, our country’s in bad shape.
Why would you do that, my love?
Let’s go, because it’s already after midnight, and we want him on our side before daylight.
True.
Just as Antony loves.
He’s his homeland’s jewel.
Amen!
My dear, let’s go inside and wait for them to arrive.
That’s uncivilized and unnatural!
In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant?
That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men.
I’ll be your wife if you’ll have me.
If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself.
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief.
Oh, Fate, come, come to me, with hands as pale as milk.
Please, come to his house with me.
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking?
Greed has been the downfall of many kings.
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband, I’ll weep away what’s left and then die with weeping.
Here’s the money you wanted, master.
Come on, let’s all go inside.
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news.
Capulet, you villain!
I don’t trust you.
Why don’t you go away for a bit?
Gentlemen, on to the bridal dinner.
Well, that doesn’t worry me.
Oh pain!
If they do fight, I hope Lysander is safe!
Don’t trust Trebonius.
Peaseblossom.
Let me see you dance. 
Give me your arm.
It’s the best thing to do.
You, fellow, step out of the crowd.
Madam, you have to go to your uncle’s.
Don’t laugh at me, but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia.
Leave all the rest to me.
You must be ready for revenge, too, when you hear me out.
Please, tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say.
You suffered a loss like mine?
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him.
What news do you bring?
No, good Sir Toby.
He lay there, stretched out like a wounded knight.
You’re not leaving the house today.
It’s a good shilling, I promise you.
It’ll be worth your while.
Be violent, bold, and firm.
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves!
What’s going on, daughter?
Please, sir, be quiet.
The more you joke about it, the more clearly I feel how serious it is!
It’s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I’d cheated on you with the Moor.
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree.
Unpunished!
He’s laughed at my losses, made fun of my earnings, humiliated my race, thwarted my deals, turned my friends against me, riled up my enemies—and why?
Did you hear that?
I can’t believe I was scared of him!
That’s how it was with Henry the Sixth, who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old.
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles, sewing it on one piece of cloth, sitting on the same cushion, singing one song in the same key, as if our hands, our sides, our voices and our minds were stuck together.
I’d trust him with everything I own.
I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty.
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief, now it’s time to cheer each other up with love.
Hastings and Edward’s children, Rivers and Grey, holy King Henry and your fine son Edward, Vaughan, and all who have died from underhanded, corrupt, fiendish injustice, if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds, enjoy the revenge—laugh at my ruin!
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy, under which our army lies, ready to die.
So when should he come?
I’ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh.
The king has been informed of all their plans, but they have no idea.
Not to his father’s house.
Put your sword away.
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me.
And what would you give me for the handkerchief?
Yes, madam, that’s the one.
You promised to tell me.
She blushes at the slightest thing.
Launcelot and I can’t agree on anything.
Don’t play any nasty tricks on me.
For that kind of relief, the patient must heal herself.
And like I am for Ganymede.
He’s busy, can’t you hear him giving orders?
I hope you get what you desire!
Ever since you lost yours.
Although you bring me joy, I can’t take joy in this exchange of promises tonight.
Oh, and then at the very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the Jew’s house.
They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re just jealous.
I’ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose, just to see how brave they are.
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this.
His letter will tell you how he’s doing.  
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off.
And when she does, he’ll imagine she’s flirting with him.
It’s not fair to punish me for something you make me do.
Let me wrap up your head, and it will feel okay in less than an hour.
I see that you are here, but I’d like you to go there and then come back again.
I wish you’d do what I ask!
And what would that accomplish?
Say what you want, but I know what I know.
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life.
Did you see anything?
What’s that?
Really, I’m only pretending to be him.
Tell her you heard us, and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun.
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy.
Is your name Goneril?
But did your sister die of love?
The sky’s so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren’t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out.
Then it’s certain they’re heading for Cyprus.
Very well, ma'am.
What’s the problem, that they cry out so loud?
I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .
Come, death, and welcome!
Who are you?
Look, he’s approaching Caesar.
That’s my brave lord!
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars, the god of war?
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio’s happiness will be like medicine to me.
To none but you, only to you.
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other.
I’ll go with you, my lord, if you’ll allow me.
He’s serious.
I’ll bet you a hundred marks, my Kate puts her flat on her back.
When you find out who started this disagreement, turn your anger upon them.
Yes, if I’m still alive, and you’re still sane, and your dinner is worth eating.
Where do you live?
Here comes my lord.
I explained how you were deceived, how you were thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did it!” You explained it all.
The enemy’s losses have been very great, pretty substantial.
Besides, I don’t like you.
Come on, envelope, open up for me.
Good morning, my friends.
You’re helping the storm, not us.
They fled toward Peloponnesus.
No, our general’s infatuation is out of control.
Oh painful, painful, painful day!
Wait, and listen to me, countrymen.
It’s not true.
Jesus, let’s kill him!
What do you think about this change?
What’s that trumpet for?
I never saw Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town?
Stinking like a swamp.
Get up early tomorrow—at the sound of the lark—noble Norfolk.
I’ll look for some way to leave his service.
Forgive us, my lord.
Help!
Tell me that you’ll accept my love.
Is supper ready?
How are you, my love?—Demetrius and Egeus, come with us.
It’s dangerous to talk about it.
If not, it’s true, this parting was well done.
You go to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
Get some light!
It’s almost morning.
Lord, may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that.
It’ll go away.
Demand.
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor.
My eyes were liars, then, because I never saw true beauty before tonight.
Why, you silly man!
I would have sworn that, too, my lord, especially against Benedick.
We’ll cool the mixture with baboon blood.
As long as I’m alive, I’ll be here.
What does the lead box say?
Here’s to Caesar.
The house will be so much quieter.
Stand further away.
There’s a fool sharing my bed now.
You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me.
Those island-bred skeletons, terrified for their bones, are an offensive sight on the morning field.
If I were king?
Do you love me?
Has Fortune turned on me, like the whore she is?
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life.
Before I saw Lysander, Athens seemed like paradise to me.
Knock, knock!
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.
Good thinking.
I’m off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding.
And now you’re asking for money.
You’ll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that  Well, you’re wrong, my Lord High Constable.
I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death.
I would be glad to forget about it, but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds.
Do promise, Kate, that you’ll do your French part to bring forth such a boy; and for my English half, take the word of a king and a bachelor.
Therefore the dukes of Berri, Bretagne, Brabant, and Orléans shall advance, and you, Prince Dauphin, will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves.
No matter what you say, my father is not dead.
God protect you from tornadoes, evil stars, and diseases!
Where?
I hope some will fall off tomorrow.
Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career.
And then?
I’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed.
But I’m wishing for something I already have.
That’s a lame answer.
Who’s there?
The moon looks sad to me.
I don’t think you would.
Tell me where you learned these strange things, and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting?
Look out, he’s coming!
Let me go, gentlemen.
No, no, until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a dream we had.
Get yourself to a 
What’s the matter?
Signed, she who would be your servant,     The Fortunate Unhappy.” This is as clear as sunlight in an open field.
Yeah, so?
Why, who’s so stupid that he can’t see through this fraud?
He’s dead.
Were you dreaming, Lucius?
Why “let it strike”?
I pity your situation.
Why do you need even one?
My God, she can’t be a Jew, she’s too nice!
That she did.
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ’s dear blood, which He shed for our terrible sins, you must leave and keep your hands off me.
Nice save!
He couldn’t eat without me talking about it.
My  Will you come on, cousin?
But we won’t shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears.
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us.
Now you know the reason for the rush.
Go on, go on.
Your lieutenant, Cassio.
Farewell.
Have you written that letter to my sister yet?
Have you completely forgotten?
Your Grace heard their saccharine words, but didn’t take note of their poisonous intentions.
He does nothing but frown, as if he wants to say, “If you don’t want me, I don’t care.” He doesn’t even smile when he hears funny stories.
Welcome, gentlemen.
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero.
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth?
Who is that gentleman?
Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself.
I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting.
Hello, sir.
Can’t you understand what I’m saying?
I’d give up my life and take my son’s place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples.—When did you lose your daughter?
Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one.
Good Captain Blunt, tell the earl goodnight from me, and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent.
Yes, you are.
You told me you hated him.
Yes, if Messala recommends me to you.
Good to see you, Iago.
Though that must have been a pitiful sight, the ground looked beautiful.
How are things going now?
Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear, which will suit you both very well.
Is it lunchtime?
We’re not going to run in our army, Monsieur Monster.
A fair woman!
That’s what I conceive of him.
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined.
Then she ran away to grieve alone.
He’s married.
He wouldn’t get drunk much, since there’s no wine here.
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping.
No trouble, sir.
Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down?
We’ll start a fire.
Draw your sword, you jerk!
And how was that one settled?
What are you going to do now?
Captain Macmorris, if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant, see, I’ll have to think you’re not treating me with the good will you ought to, see, since I am as good a man as yourself, both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects.
Not even trivial things were left out.
From our brother monarch, the king of England?
Boys, how are you both doing?
I hope, sir, that you’re not angry that I’ve been equally attentive to you both!  
My God!
Judging from his appearance, I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt.
Give me your hand.
She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine.
Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender.
I’ll tell you: it’s because of a law as plain as Father Time’s bald head.
Stand back, boy.
I do indeed, my lord.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand up.
Quiet!
Oh heavens!
Have you forgotten her?
Aren’t you Lady Olivia’s fool?
Is he in his royal garments?
You said it right, old mole.
That’s why you sleep so soundly.
Beatrice— I swear, I’m going.
Who takes care of them?
I can tell you, but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him.
Go look for him.
It’s certain that she is dead, and she died in a strange way.
What a king Claudius is!
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast.
An illicit kiss!
Which one of them did it?
So the candle went out and now we’re all in the dark.
I didn’t write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations.
Farewell, hostess.
Oh heaven, oh earth, witness what I’m about to say, and reward me if I tell the truth!
What’s that?
Thank God and my horoscope!
By my count, I was already your mother at just about your age, while you remain a virgin.
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
Stop arguing and listen to my plans.
I’d never heard such raucous music, such pleasant thunder.
Listen to you!
I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes.
Tomorrow, and then every day after that.
Night is approaching.
Where are your leather apron and your ruler?
Go to my room and put on something of mine.
But here’s a paper with Caesar’s seal on it.
Also—I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this—in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me.
Get lost, will you?
I’ll punish you so harshly that you’ll regret causing me this loss.
I mean what I say.
What kind of crude jerk are you?
I could have saved her.
Before I fall asleep, I entrust my soul to you.
Before your sentence has been completed?
And women.
Oh, good judge!
Their story is bizarre and astounding, but it’s solid and consistent.
Now, soldiers, advance.
That’s how flimsy and unreal pleasure is.
He killed your relative, brave Mercutio, and then young Romeo killed him.
Do you maintain the same story?
We’ll be your witnesses.
Yes, I swear.
Oh sirs, consider this: those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it.
Separate them.
Here he comes with Captain Jamy, the Scots captain.
I can’t go any further.
Are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now?
What mistress do you have?
Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts.
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him.
When did I say all that?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you?
She has a body, not a life.
But how is it possible that you still remember this, through all the darkness of the past?
You can’t talk about something that you don’t feel.
Valentine’s Day is over.
He will live as a cursed man.
And what a beard trimmed like the general’s or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale, you wouldn’t believe.
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned.
Oh, my lord, when wisdom and passion are in one body, it’s ten to one that the passion will win.
But I beg your pardon.
Oh great, here come the Capulets.
Listen!
And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league.
What’s she trying to say?
Still, did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her?
Tyrrel, come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths.
Cassio, my lord?
The Prince’s fool”!
You’re right, Lysander’s admirable too.
But when exactly will we see Benedick married?
It’s meant in good will.
Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised?
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour?
What’s wrong with you?
Good—here’s the stretcher.
You inhuman dog!
What was it that you told me today—that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?
You’re wrong about that, I assure you.
No, I’ll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument.
I’m afraid of what they might encourage him to do, considering the state he’s in.
The second cock crowed.
It’s hard to make sense of such different stories.
But I can’t play a melody.
He’s an important person.
Can’t you see that?
There’s going to be a storm.
Every glass of liquor is damned, and the devil’s the main ingredient!
Please, dear, calm down.
Did you see that?
And yet you say that exile is not death?
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change.
But excuse me,  Yes, I’m talking about Launcelot, sir.
Carthage?
Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring.
I swear— —each actor arrived on his ass.
Hello, Tubal.
I swear I will— Come on, let’s go see what happens.
If you want to come have dinner with me, you can.
Antony’s eyes are fiery red from crying.
Word is that Richmond is the navy’s admiral.
Well, she can get used to it.
I think it’s my bad eyesight that’s making me see this horrible vision.
Why, do you know of any harm intended toward him?
Is there anything offensive in it?
Did you talk with this woman?
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today.
Let’s go!
Me too.
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret, who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot.
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself.
Good spirit!
Why do you look so upset?
If our father continues to use his authority as usual, then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us.
Doesn’t a Jew have hands, bodily organs, a human shape, five senses, feelings, and passions?
Murder and treason!
Yes, Caesar?
Order them to move back.
Contagious infection of humanity, give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know you’ve committed.
The adult snake lies in the ditch.
The storm has begun and everything is at stake.
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother.
What he just said to me—it’s alright.
Now let’s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs.
Portia!
What could I say, my dear?
Demetrius, I’m ready to fight you as promised.
I’ll get your goats, Audrey.
Is it true, is it true?
Me, a penny?
I’m not much of a drinker.
He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it.
Why are you telling me this?
There!… And over there!… And over there!
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim.
Well, the  Shall we get moving?
These are nothing but jealous lies.
Often I have heard of “sanctuary men,” but until now I’ve never heard of “sanctuary children.” My lord, you’ve won me over this time.
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear king, to win back what’s rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire.
It’s—But he’s drowned, and these guys are devils.
In saving you I consider myself well paid.
I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up.
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid.
BASSANIO Please, Leonardo, think about this  I’ll do my best.
No, please.
Six or seven thousand, at most.
What did he say?
Wait a minute.
Get to it, be lustful, sleep around—I need soldiers for my army.
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you’ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb.
Think about the ones who have died.
Just now.
Keep up your courage, man!
Tell us how it happened, noble Casca.
Is that how it is, really?
That’s it.
No, I’m begging you now, tell me who it is.
Boatswain!
Oh, for Pete’s sake!
Poor lady, she’ll go crazy when she sees it’s missing.
I don’t have a lord.
It was yours, I swear.
Look, sir, this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment.
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad.
So take your last breath.
But so what?
Indeed I did, my lord.
Now, lords, don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition.
What should I say to her?
Sweet marjoram.
Instead, hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness.
Is this the work of an ambitious man?
It’s pretty well done, isn’t it?
The candle is burning in your study, sir.
Mine did too.
I don’t have to give you answers that you like.
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife.
I give you my obedience and my humble service, madam.
Yes, him, woman.
You will be whipped.  
The gods forbid!
But you’re not going to deliver it, are you?
If she punishes you, master, she’s sure to punish me.
We’ll eat at her place.
Did you think I was talking about sex?
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again, and I’ll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble.
It’s true!
Think about our situation, then die.
It’s true.
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her?
Then I rebel against you, stars!
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen.
I was not myself, as a result of the wine.
This is not a maiden, as you say, but an old man—wrinkled, faded, and withered.
What’s amazing is how long he lasted.
That’s the way it should be—only Antony should conquer Antony.
Welcome to Rome.
It’s just that my wit is very gentlemanly, Margaret, and refuses to hurt a woman.
God bless you and make you obedient, loving, and kind.  
Good job, my little one.
Is it that early in the day?
Just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven, Indulge me, forgive me, and set me free.
You’re going to pay for this, Roderigo.
When you fight against your country’s enemies, you will be paid for your efforts with your country’s wealth.
Take up my mistress' gown for his master’s use!
So stop crying.
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying.
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver.
He knows what?
I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea.
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman.
Ma'am, you wouldn’t treat me like this if I were your father’s dog.
His letter’s going to be hilarious.
Then, gentlemen, we can count on trouble.
Listen to me, Queen.
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break.
Yes, sir, we hope so.
Oh, what evil!
Bloody, inhuman villain!
I’d bet my life that, as young as you are, you’ve fallen in love with someone.
Your father’s sons would make excellent husbands, if only a girl could catch one for herself.
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it?
I hope those lions stay far away from him.
Are these our eyes?
We have two hours to get ready.
Goodbye.
I promise.
Here’s why: it’d be better for the enemy to come after us.
Who will advance with me?
I’ll take comfort in my books and music, reading and practicing my instruments.
Every month he has a new best friend.
Good night, lieutenant.
Don’t you suspect my office?
Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar.
Women are sex machines below the waist, though they’re chaste up above.
No, he’s in Florence.
If we lose, what do you plan to do?
Leave them alone, and do the murder first.
Tell her. 
We’ll follow you.
Who’s dead?
I am an ass, indeed: you can tell by my long ears.
Yes indeed.
All ladies love me, except you.
I defy brain-death!
Have faith, love me, and you will get better.
Gratiano!
I’ve been dishonored: I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore.
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy.
Goodbye, then.
What is it, sir?
Oh, my, it’s my husband.
But who is this person, sir?
Go back again, slave, and bring him home.
What was I saying?
Open your gates.
You’re not supposed to get old until you’re wise.
Yes, that the king is dead.
What kept you from telling him this?
Calphurnia!
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son?
Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers.
You can do whatever you want as long as it’s socially appropriate.
And you told me to bury my love.
The rest of the dead are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires, and gentlemen of birth and rank.
No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on.
In that case I’m afraid you’re damned by both your father and your mother.
Answer me like men.
That’s it?
Am I that name, Iago?
Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio?
You have to be patient with me.
No, I’d rather you stayed here.
Your Clarence, who stabbed my Edward, is also dead.
You are welcome for his sake.
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world.
You foolish madman, listen to me for a moment.
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss.
Amen to that.
My dearest relative, I’m begging you, pull yourself together.
I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers.
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation.
Where have  Come here, boy.
Get down and swear it.
Indeed, the enemy nearly took the bridge, but he was forced to retreat, and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge.
Whether it’s even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she’ll be fourteen.
Go home, you lazy men.
It’s a long story—and tough to listen to.
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man.
I’ll follow it.
Come here, man.
Poor man!
The thane of Fife had a wife.
If a man’s brain were in his feet, wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite?
How is she?
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall.
How are you, my lord?
You kick me out, he kicks me back.
Why did I ever have one?
I will, my Hermia.
Brown, madam, and she wouldn’t want her forehead to be any lower.
Well done!
Who I am and what I want are a secret.
I’ll try to calm him down for you if I can.
I’m sure you aren’t Launcelot, my boy.
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus.
I’d rather bear with you than  Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
I’m forty-eight.
Romeo has been banished.” That news brings infinite death.
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped.
Don’t worry about me.
With all my heart, I’ll join you.
Name them.
Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it.
It’s possible, ma'am.
And she can cry, sir—oh, how she can cry!
Keep me balanced and sane.
Oh, this is wonderful, wonderful—just wonderful wonderful!
I think I’m getting delirious.
I don’t think so.
Wipe your eyes.
Everything about this is unnatural!
Believe me, I’ll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side.
If your highness is willing, take revenge on him for that—because I know you’re brave enough, I don’t dare to— That’s for sure.
Oh, come on.—Come here, sir.
They really wish they were somewhere else, but they want to descend on us, looking fierce so we’ll think they’re brave.
And if our navy wins tomorrow, no doubt our army will do their part.
By running fast.
Spread the word.
We’ll rise and leave early tomorrow.
Who doesn’t know he’s dead?
But where is Kate?
Yes, if you kept them together and invested them.
Good-bye.
My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks.
You know where she is.
You admit it, then?
By Hercules, I think I’m right.
She took that ring from me.
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat.
Callow youth, you don’t yet know how to love!
No words can express the pain.
Yes, you’ve been a ladies' man in your time.
The clock has chimed midnight.
She creeps along.
Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia!
Welcome.
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well, but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason.
I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth.
Please don’t take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken.
Here’s the head of that notorious traitor, the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture?
Follow it, follow it!
And here I am, with that piece.
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now?
He’s not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body, but praying, to nourish his attentive soul.
Me too.
He’s late.
I’ll tell you everything exactly as it happened.
So do you take her or leave her?
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face?
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation.
His words are like poison to me.
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen, and what you deserve is to act like my subjects.
When she cries, all the little flowers cry too.
Heaven help her!—Get him out of here for now.
Tell me, who had him arrested?
There’s no power in Venice that can change an established decree.
Come here, sir.
Cassius, stand firm.
What are you doing?
Oh, I’ll rest here forever.
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France, achieving and accomplishing everything I’ve assembled them to do?
I think few die well who die in battle.
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France—I cannot tell vat is  To kiss.
She lives about twenty miles from Athens, and she thinks of me as a son.
If her eyes were in the night sky, they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing, thinking her light was the light of day.
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you.
No, please, read it like a sane person.
Dark as hell, Sir Topas.
The same thing.
How did you learn about this?
Listen!
Wake up, I say!
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul, and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion.
Your highness will have to force me to tell.
Bless you, fair lady!
If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom.
For we may take pity on you, even if we can’t pardon you.
Oh, right, good Catesby.
I’m not sick if you’ve prepared some honorable exploit for me.
Your husband’s mad, isn’t he?
Take me inside some house, Benvolio, or I’ll pass out.
And now I’m going to leave your despised company.
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow!
Who is to blame for this: Antony or I?
Yes, they are.
Some kind of fountain?
How did you divide yourself in two?
I have a lot to tell you about them.
No, not a penny.
I’m sorry to have to say this— Help me away from here, dear Charmian!
By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father.
Did he confess?
What did he say when he regained consciousness?
I’ve done everything you accuse me of—and more, much more.
And now he’s gone.
Now I’ll tell you so you don’t have to ask.
And just in time, here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe.
Good cousin, good Meg, good Ursula, come help me get dressed.
Why not?
You’re  Forgive me, Signior Gremio, but I’m anxious to get things moving.
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even though I leave here, I stay with you.
Do it well, and then leave us.
Tell me, spirit, how’s the king and his entourage?
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king.
In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow.
Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him.
Please don’t say no.
It’s a good thing I’m like a little pot and warm up quickly, or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, and my heart would freeze in my belly, before I managed to get thawed out.
If I cut my finger, I’ll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding.—And your name, sir?
My dear friends, thanks for your patience.
There is no life, but my love is dead!
Fire!
Sometimes I’ll turn into fire!
Young man, your father’s dead.
That’s good, my boy.
There’s not a strand of feather left in our whole army—a good sign, I hope, that we won’t fly away like birds—and time on the field has made us slovenly.
So have a seat and talk to her.
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me, I’ll try to get him to do what’s good for him.
What are you going to tell her, Nurse?
Okay.
Really, niece, you’ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people.
That’s not the tune I had in mind.
In my bedroom window there is a book.
Somebody’s knocking.
Do you know any, count?
They are his dung, and he their beetle.
Go ahead and write it down.
I like the morning.
Give me a cup of wine.
Look over your lines again.
Look for yourself—see the top of the cliff way up there?
You sent for me, sir?
If you poison us, don’t we die?
Poor Tom, your cup is empty.
He’ll grow up to be a proper man.
Quiet!
Speak.
She is banished.
And harm is getting close!
I must go report what happened.
Bring us some wine!
I agree.
Sir, be a man.
Indeed, she gives a very good testimony of the snake’s power.
What Tranio did, he did at my command.
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person.
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you.
Then, rejecting my request, you kill 
That’s all.
I’ll wear a big sword in my belt, carry a boar-spear in my hand, and hide all my womanish fear in my heart.
I beg your pardon—I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names.
What about Falconbridge, that young English baron?
Give me an aphrodisiac, pharmacist.
Turn the ship to the wind!
He meant he did nothing right for me—which is true, unfortunately.
You didn’t go to sleep, then?
Come on, Desdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you, to tell you what you need to do.
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn’t love you least.
He’s hiding out in Friar Lawrence’s cell.
I don’t until you practice them on me.
Let heaven be my witness—I’m putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othello’s control.
Give me your hand.
What was the philosopher Pythagoras’s belief about wild birds?
I hope maybe then you’ll send him back home soon.  
Let fortune and victory be yours!
Oh, really?
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice’s love?
Civil wounds now can heal, and peace can live again.
No, cousin, I’m going to Fife.
Right now I’m away from home and I can’t provide you with proper care.
If he has my father’s love, then that’s enough honor for me.
Let’s sit here and let the music fill our ears.
Thus, I’ll leave without being kissed.
Who were you chasing with your sword?
A daughter?
He liked to call me a loan shark; let him think about his debt to me.
My beautiful queen, we’ll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music.
Yes, dear madam.
Nothing that you want to hear, my lord, but nothing so bad that I can’t mention it.
I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her.
Stand and fight, you overdressed servant, fight!
Don’t be upset.
I’ll miss you, Ariel, but you’ll be free.—Yes, you will, yes.—Go to the king’s ship in your invisible state.
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair.
Don’t delay, Caesar.
I can’t do this.
I swear, she’s a very good-natured lady.
It’s my men who should call me “lord.” I’m your man, your fellow.
I think he’s actually serious, and not just being polite.
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes.
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen.
Yes.
The last thing he did before sending me off, dear Queen, was to kiss—the last of many such kisses—this Indian pearl for you.
If he asks to see me, tell him I’m sick and went to bed.
This little prank of hers is going to cost me.
Otherwise—forgive me, but if you should die before him, what becomes of her dowry?
Be kind to her.
Good.
Welcome, my lord.
I won’t answer that.
How are you, my golden girl?
The best way to be happy is to be in between.
Please lie down and rest a while, my lord.
Look up moonshine, look up moonshine!
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better.
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day.
Uncle!
In God’s name, I beg you not to wish for one more man.
I won’t stay behind.
I don’t understand why she’s not locked up.
You are welcome here, sister.
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind, and if you can’t take it, then you’d better plug your ears.
A false conclusion.
This box is too threatening.
I’ve heard many of the noblest Romans—next to immortal Caesar—speaking of you, complaining of the tyranny of today’s government, and wishing that your eyes were working better.
Every night I’m awakened by his  Poor dear, goodbye.
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste.
It’s hard to see clearly in the dark of night, but it’s easier to hear well. 
You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man.
I hope you are pleased with the snake.
That’s enough.
I will, Caesar.
Me too, but still, for the sake of good manners, I’ll say thanks for your company.
Dromio, what stuff of mine did you put on a ship?
All right, I’ll stay another month.
I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio.
Oh, my liege, my wife died tonight.
It’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.
He is, my lord.
I hope you go senile soon, sir, so you can become a more foolish fool!
Don’t take Helena’s side.
Look how shapely your legs are.
Tell me.
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent.
Are you the lady of the house?
Listen to me, you traitor.
What a tunneler!
I can swim like a duck, I swear.
I’m the man she wants.
Stop.
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed. 
But this whole thing is strange.
I wish you well.
You’d give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit.
The whole time.
If it’s me, there’s no time as good as this hour of Caesar’s death, and no weapon better than your swords, covered with the noblest blood in the world.
It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.
My friends, are you all Lady Olivia’s servants?
Before I could break up the fight, Tybalt was killed.
Where’s Monsieur Mustardseed?
Yes, my lord.
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping, then you’re already up to your ankles in blood.
Cassio can have my job.
We know what’s appropriate for a watch.
Is that enough of an answer?
I don’t care.
Yes, my lord.
Damn you for teaching me your language!
We’re not invading England out of ambition or greed, but out of love—dear love!—and my father’s right to his kingdom.
My master’s decision.
Yes, very much like a whale.
Thank you.
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around?          
I’m very sensitive, and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings.
He’s made me a Christian.
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban’s sheep—Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham’s birthright, because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir— What’s your point?
Let’s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out.
Get out!
Oh, how awful!
Oh, if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns!
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Where’s Antonio, then?
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up.
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do.
Why are you doing this?
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war.
The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are.
What time is it?
We’ll all want our fortune told.
I’ll follow after you.
Go and get her dressed.
Oh, well.
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post?
I’ll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace.
An angel is walking on earth.
The villain won’t escape.
And you’ve done well on land.
If she refuses my proposal, I’ll tell her how much I’m looking forward to the announcement and the wedding.
I have no more royal sons for you to murder.
I tried to stop speaking plainly, since you dislike plain speech so much.
Who in the crowd is calling me?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
Yes, it is.
It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side.
I am not in the giving mood today.
I can’t watch any more.
Your features, God help us!
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you.
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges?
Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago?
Don’t I have a reason to be angry, you disobedient hags?
So get ready to leave.
Come, come, we’re worrying about the worst-case scenario.
Burn!
And whatever we do, we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants.
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where.
You couldn’t find out anything about them?
Is it that aggressive?
Good morning, Brutus.
If you hadn’t been their father, your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion.
Why are you whispering?
Let me see it.
How can you blame her, a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes, for objecting to having a blind, naked boy appear before her?
I’ll listen to Brutus.
As good a wife as she is, that’s how good a husband I am to you.
I, fight against you, Antony?
We’ve finished our business.
A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous.
I’m my own spokesman.
These corpses suggest mayhem.
Tomorrow, I’ll let you know what I’ve decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England.
She blushes from guilt, not modesty.
Beware of jealousy, my lord!
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol.
Do as you please, because I’m done worrying about you.
My name is Hortensio, sir.
Like her?
Damn you!
What is your news?
Don Pedro is here.
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart.
What shall I do for you?
Lysander, say something!
Romeo, are you going to your father’s for lunch?
Lucentio!
God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older.
Roderigo!
St. George loses his holiness once  Then, by myself— You’ve misused yourself.
Thank you, my noble lord.
The Earth is nature’s mother and also nature’s tomb.
Yes, my lord, and calfskin too.
It would be wonderfully wise of you, my dear Reynaldo, to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him.
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it.
And the one who commands us is our king.
Let everyone beware: I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose.
Sir Toby, I’ve got to be frank with you.
My friends, listen.
I didn’t survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now.
Then it’s no surprise they had a bad influence on him.
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you, giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us.
Follow me if you’re brave enough, and we’ll fight over Helena.
Fabian, bring him here.
To, to, to— To murder me?
Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips.
But what do I care about words?
Why do you ask?
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don’t like them?
Heaven help me, I don’t know you, sir.
Oh, did he?
Treason!
What’s Pyramus?
Tell me, my good friend, what is that light over there?
And wouldn’t I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm?
Then that’s the way it’ll be.
God be with all of you, princes.
What, was I married to her in a dream?
Just remember to grab his books first, since without them he’s just a poor fool like me, and can’t command a single spirit.
Iago, give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice.
My enemies help me understand myself better, which is an advantage, and my friends help me lie about myself, which is a disadvantage.
Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better.
No, Antony.
Mark Antony will say I’m not well, and to please you I’ll stay at home.
Go, lad, and find out what the trumpet’s sounding for.
I’m so amazed by this, I don’t know what to say.
If you can love a man of this temperament, Kate, whose face a sunburn wouldn’t make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself, let your eye improve me.
We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways.
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit.
That’s why he hates me.
I’ll also wear this in my cap.
I’ll have to ask you some questions, madam.
Hello, sir.
If I let myself do what I yearn to, I’d rip the flesh off your bones.
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease.
There’s been a whole debate on the topic.
You’re getting too angry.
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar’s head and then hack at his arms and legs too, Caius Cassius—because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar’s arms.
This dream has been interpreted all wrong.
I’d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way?
Now I’ll stand up.
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet?
Give my regards to Hastings, Catesby.
Thieves!
It’s really the only way, Sir Andrew.
Don’t worry about me.—Your sister and the duke are here.
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful.
Come, I’ll show you your bridal chamber.
I’ve been so tortured since I lost track of you!
That’s not a job for a friend, my lord.
No, master, I’ve been changed in both mind and body.
Hey, look over there!
Get out!
She says that you should come to her.
If this young gentleman has offended you, I’ll take the blame for it.
But why, why, why?
Mark Antony, should we give the signal to attack?
Yes, she did tell us.
I’ll go ahead of you, sir. 
I heard that Apollodorus carried—   What did he carry, please?
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life?
Yes, you’re absolutely right.
The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential.
That’s all I want, and I’ll do anything to accomplish it.
And I’m expecting his reproach.
Don’t you have any brothers like you?
Well, we’ll speak more soon.
Let me talk to you about your situation.
Just one glass.
Don’t miss our feast.
We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely.
Come on, sir, let’s go.
Or maybe, to make it even more lovely, I’ll sing it when the heroine dies. 
What, even you, Brutus?
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness deserves thanks.
Is  Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands?
Oh, I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that, and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with!
What do you say?
Naked,” he says.
I swear I do.
I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything.
Apparently so.—Cover their faces.
If I live long enough to touch you again, that would be as good as having my eyesight back.
Fine, thank you.
It’s wrong, and I’m starting to realize I’m being cheated!
My lord, he just left here.
The noise they’re making will wake up Demetrius.
Listen, Clitus.
I could marry you there, gentle Hermia, where the strict laws of Athens can’t touch us.
Come on, come on.
Yes, well, things could get better.
Will it eat me?
If he’s nearby, I want an explanation.
I got this purse full of money from you, and my Dromio brought it to me.
Tell me, friend.
Lay me next to my mistress.
Who wishes that?
Traveling from Sardis, two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there, eating from the hands of the soldiers who’d accompanied us to Philippi.
By God, I’m going to tell the duke how slack you’ve been.
But come on, inconsistent young man, come with me.
Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here.
Not me.
Let any man perish who isn’t ready now!
Good night, Pompey. 
I’ll help you.
Remember you!
Remember March, March 15th.
Free from the bondage you are in, Messala.
Come on, you turtle!
He can act as brave as he wants, but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames, and I wish he were, too, and I with him, whatever the danger, so long as we were far away from here.
Who are you?
And if he doesn’t deserve this joy on earth, he’ll never deserve it in heaven.
Yes, my lord.
Well sir, they’ve lied; moreover, they have said things that were not true; secondarily, they are slanderers; sixth and lastly, they have falsely accused a lady; thirdly, they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen; and, in conclusion, they are lying scoundrels.
There’s only one hope for you, and even that’s a kind of illegitimate hope.
Refusing to fight him at sea won’t disgrace you.
Oh, you  If you want to praise Caesar, just say his name—that’s all the praise that’s necessary.
Oh, and young men never die?
Go on!
Well, it doesn’t matter.
We all must die, Messala.
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield, the lover will be rewarded for his sighs, the crazy character can rant all he wants, the clown will make everybody laugh, and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind, or I’ll stop the play.
Well, then he must be alive.
Then I’ll change it to this: Father Time himself is bald, so for all time there will be bald men.
But my hair looks good anyway, doesn’t it?
Go ask.
Look in on me, and talk with me, or I’ll attack even without a weapon.
The king’s son, Ferdinand, with his hair standing straight up—it looked like reeds, not hair—was the first person to jump, shouting, “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here!” Good job!
Why won’t he?
Take it to heart, Dorset.
Is Cassius nearby?
Well, I’m not beautiful, so I hope that I can at least be chaste.
I will, sir.
And you can’t deny evidence and argument—They’ve been around since Noah’s ark.
You can’t go back into the house unless you want to fight with me—and if you’re willing to do that, you might as well just go and fight with him.
Anyway, sir, should I go see the lady?
No we’re not—it’s night.
I can’t promise that love won’t transform me, but I can promise you this: until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool.
No, it’s not as deep as a well, or as wide as a church door, but it’s enough.
Yes, ma'am.
And I’ve never met any men besides you and my father.
No doubt, but you may be going about it the wrong way—Neighbor, this gift is very gracious, I’m sure.
He did ask for mercy.
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source.
Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you.
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and repented deeply.
Holy Franciscan Friar!
Come this way, my lord.
What do you want from me?
I’m really a pitiful singer.
I am sick and sullen.
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows, though shot by enemies, could not?
Oh, Pomfret, Pomfret!
You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands.
Ariel, you’ve done your work exactly as I ordered.
Terrible.
Get out of here.
That’s right, she did.
It’s a bad time for such an injury.
Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced.
Let’s be disciplined and not delay, because tomorrow is a busy day.
You piece of filth, you’re lying!
She has a low-pitched voice.
He must be possessed by the devil.
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven.
I don’t know, sir.
Come here, Tyrrel.
Will he bring his army?
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love.
That’s enough.
There has never been so black a day as today.
Oh, but these are our friends.
Hurry to a convent.
I’m your little dog, Demetrius.
Where’s Antony?
I hope to see good days—and many of them.
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king’s two sons, have run away and fled, which makes them the prime suspects.
It’s a lucky sign, isn’t it?
Brother, you’ve made a mistake.
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him—you and the other servants.
It was love that performed these miracles.
Give me your hand.
Please, fool, go away.
It’s torture, not mercy.
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that!
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you, You’ll have a fool’s head forever.
I want you to do some things for our wedding, and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both.
If that’s what you say, go fight a duel with me and prove it.
You may come across better food, but not a warmer welcome.
I refuse to accept that.
No, from the moon, I’m telling you.
Beat—
I’ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets.
Oh, dear God, don’t let me go mad!
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams.
But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out.
Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person.
It was a lovely wedding, and we’re doing really well on our trip home.
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage.
Oh, Kent, what could I ever do to become as good as you are?
Goodbye, good sir.
What’s wrong, cousin?
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone.
You said it when you were furious.
You’re going to rest while you’re still damned?
Can you buy them with money?
Arrest me if you dare.
Beat him up.
Helena, it’s not true.
Who offered him the crown?
I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France.
I hope to God I’m proven wrong!
Take him to the surgeons.
I can’t see ahead of me.
There’s more to this ring than its cash value.
Take me to him.
Good advice, indeed.
If you stick with me, when the time comes, there will be something in it for you.
Name one.
How clever of you.
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.
It’s called the evil.
You thought you were being funny, but you said the truth.
From now on, goodness in women, not superficial beauty, will win my heart.
What?
Petruchio?
It’s a trick to confuse us.
I won’t listen to your pleas or excuses.
Over your wounds—which, like speechless mouths, open their red lips, as though to beg me to speak—I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men.
I think he got his jacket in Italy, his tights in France, his hat in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.
When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother.
No, dear Queen.
So go to your deaths, poor miserable wretches, the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure.
Do you need something?
No more of these thoughts.
He still hasn’t told us about the captain.
Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage. 
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you, as there’s a risk that you might have a relapse.
When he regained consciousness again, he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong, he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness.
If this logic works, that’s great.
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust.
Give me your blessing.
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too.
I know it’s the moon.
They sing when they die.
And, just in time, here comes the sweaty lord.
There’s still the King of France’s farewell ceremony.
Sir, he left his belongings and treasure.
And he’s still warm, by God.
Christ, it’s a disaster.
Let’s go for it.
He’s called Modo and Mahu.
Is he here?
I had a son, whom I’ve legally disowned.
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me.
And all my children?
Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little.
Oh, a thousand times worse, a thousand times—and what a sweet personality she has!
I don’t feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one.
I’m strong-willed.
Is Signior Lucentio at home, sir?
Has Romeo killed himself?
So be it.
At Pembroke, or at Harfordwest in Wales.
He’s dead.
Why are you looking at me so strangely?
Why did I just send you home?
Not one drop sooner.
She’s too much for me to handle.
his daughter, Katherine, with some insignificant, unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry.
I followed it here, or I should say it dragged me here.
Oh, sad day!
The next bit of good news is that our ship—which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago—is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail.
Back so soon?
Have you seen my lord?
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights, this foolish patience will abandon you.
Not old enough to be a man, but not young enough to be a boy.
Tell me, my daughter Juliet, what is your attitude about getting married?
I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion.
It’s your turn now.
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up, on strict orders from him.
Lovely, most lovely Katherine, will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours?
Do you honestly think—tell me, Emilia—there are women who’d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner?
I will not be faced or bested.
But how will we keep it from being passed now, my lord?
Come on, sweet Audrey.
But insincere men, like horses who are too lively at the start of a race, make a big show of their spirit.
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him?
How can you top that?
Be thrifty.
He’s lying dead in a ditch, with twenty deep gashes in his head, any one of which would have been enough to kill him.
I am satisfied.
Please forgive me as I forgive you, Hamlet.
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions, and so they go unpunished.
Heaven knows you’re as unfaithful as hell.
I will be brief because I’m not going to live long enough to tell a boring story.
Just as the ox has his yoke, the horse its bridle, the falcon a tether, a man has his desires—to keep in check.
It’s nothing.
I swear to God you’re accusing me wrongly!
Everything’s OK.
If what you say is true, you can do the same to me. 
I couldn’t bear to obey all of your daughters' harsh orders.
No, cousin, I’m crying.
Good night, you amazing woman, you.
How dare    What, is the man crazy?
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one, and I don’t love him any more than I love my bastard.
Well, let’s have it, Grumio.
You don’t have more than half an hour to live.
Go to my brother Cassius.
Did he marry me just to starve me?
But she is no virgin.
Oh, he’s crazy, Laertes!
You want proof?
Do you think it would work?
I asked a servant.
Excellent, very good.
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful.
Oh, noble fool!
Meet me in a little while at the citadel.
What’s that music?
Come, let’s go to the dance.
There you go.
The table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart.
Then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage.
Yes, even if I die an hour later.
I know a terrific wench.
The world is not your friend, and neither is the law.
You’re a lover.
Oh, forgive me!
Twenty crowns.
Please, let me go.
I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away.
And  I feel that I love her.
Only you would look for a fight like that.
Oh, so madmen like you are also deaf.
What’s happening now, Lucillius?
Here’s Decius Brutus.
Yes, he’s the one who first told me about her.
Oh, Charmian, I will never leave this tomb!
Gloucester, it’s true that we are in great danger.
Now he won’t give me either.
Dear father, if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers, please put an end to it.
Good morning, brother Bedford.
There’s no point in looking for him if he doesn’t want to be found.
Keep him away from me!
Take this!
Listen Tranio!
If she returns my jewels, I’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her.
Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.
For the favor of sleeping in her bed.
Who’s talking to him now?
He followed you.
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on.
May God give their souls rest.
And I am your Rosalind.  
Ambassadors of Harry, king of England, request a hearing with your Majesty.
Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore.
That’s music to my ears.
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up.
Murder, murder!
If she offers him her love, it’s very possible that he’ll scorn it, since, as we all know, he tends to be contemptuous.
You’ll be my role model.
Oh, how wonderful to see you!
Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago.
Your crown is crooked.
You’re not as close to death as you think you are.
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock’s house?
If her breath were as terrible as her words, she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star.
Who are you?
I was conceived by a woman, and I thank her very much for all her effort.
Well, enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep.
I heard him groan—yes, I did—and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried, “Give me some water, Titinius,” like a sick girl.
Everything is a sick joke.
Calm down, gentle cousin.
I’ll kill myself out of grief!
Why, the one I just told you about.
Make room for Antony, most noble Antony!
If he’s never drunk it before, it’ll help soothe his fever.
That’s all there is to say.
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life.
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love.
If you care about your health, you won’t push me any further.
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips, I’ll be covered in blood.
Yet not one among them, if all three were to wait on me, could be my “man,” because three such fakes don’t amount to a man.
She’s sending this ring back to you, sir.
That’s old news.
But his navy rules the sea.
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and terrible.
Another thing, Domitius: Antony wants to see you now.
What a pretty picture, three fools all together.
I’ve transferred Richard’s body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood.
Please come in.
Won’t the dawn come from here?
Now go and get me some booze.
My sons Edward and Clarence!
You probably killed a lot of his men?
I never caused her any harm, as far as I know.
Do you really think so?
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting.
It was two o'clock when I left him, and now it’s one.
I’ll follow the priest and go with you; and after I’ve sworn to be faithful, I’ll be faithful forever.
Young man, something’s wrong if you’re getting out of bed this early.
Oh God, I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples, as king and queen!
Come on, we’re wasting precious daylight.
Yes,” said my husband, “Did you fall on your face?
My noble king, my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother, the haughty Bishop of Exeter, are now in  My king, the Guildfords in  My lord, the duke of Buckingham’s army— Enough, you 
The truth will be all the inheritance you get.
Anything.
She’ll be buried with her face upwards, then.
Give us answers.
This is just a trifling matter here, sir.
He’s a devil, a born devil, who can never be trained.
Time’s not the one in debt.
What if I am?
Look, here comes someone who loves me, along with someone who loves her.
Agreed.
That’s true, my lord.
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight.
And what do you know, boy?
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost the most consummate Alexas, where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen?
Isn’t that him heading this way?
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could.
It sure is.
Stay!
Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him.
Tie up his withered old arms.
We don’t have any music that can’t be heard.
I’ve heard that’s not the most nourishing food.
Come, let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful.
There, take that, you scoundrel!
What’s my name?
We’ll perform all the holy rites.
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you.
What is it?
I rely on your virtue to protect me.
He was dressed so oddly too!
If our father were dead you’d receive half of his revenue forever, and you’d have my undying love,      Edgar.” Hmm, what’s this, a conspiracy?
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
At my humble house tonight, you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below.
Are you still set on marrying my brother’s daughter?
Send the necklace to her, or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me.
I wear it with pride, for I am Welsh you know, good countryman.
Tonight we’ll have dinner.
Now you have only the memory of what you were, which tortures you when you consider what you’ve become.
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety.
What a heavy sigh!
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you, my noble knight, what do you think?
Like a mouse caught in my own trap, Osric.
It’s a measly little cap, a dessert crust, a plaything, a silk pie.
Even if I had sworn never to marry, I wouldn’t trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me.
I’m not talking about proof yet.
But a stronger pity, for the wrongs committed against Rome, drove out our pity for Caesar, as fire drives out fire, and so we killed him.
I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king. 
Leonato and his brother.
I’ve been invited to supper, Jessica.
Well, may peace be with you.
Madam, with all my heart.
But let’s follow it, and then do our dirty work afterward.
Sir, it’s the Moor.
Take away this lout and whip him.
When it comes to defense, it’s best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems.
Where’s the king?
I’ll debate this with you later, and then I’ll teach you to listen more carefully.
Where am I?
Just as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs.
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows; it is a charitable duty my order performs.
I’ll expect you.
Heaven help us!
There isn’t any other way, unless you took on another form and became someone else.
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them?
I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs.
It was a good and lucky vision.
I forgot about the reward.
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he’s not a real lion.
Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him.
The more I pray, the less I get out of it.
You notorious whore!
Killed?
I certainly did, and I never wanted to see you again.
Ratcliffe, my lord, it’s me.
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now.
Doesn’t she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom?
Unleash the dogs in the western valley.
I loved him, as much as any father ever loved his son.
Oh, evil, evil!
I’ll tell them where you come from, though I don’t know who you are or what you want.
Where are your sister and Hortensio’s wife?
We’re on a tight schedule.
Be happy.
You haven’t been conquered.
She and Susan—God rest her and all Christian souls—were born on the same day.
Who’s this?
But if I am myself, then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife.
Goodbye.
Sir, that would be me and my partner.
That’s the only witchcraft I ever used.
Oh, you wicked scoundrel!
Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after.
I wouldn’t stay here tonight for the entire town.
Yes, Casca.
He did, my lord.
I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t take Othello’s place.
Fool!
I’ve said too much in telling you of it.
Queen of Egypt, greetings!
No, he just gets reality completely wrong.
My lady, will you have a dance with me?
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging.
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I’ll say goodbye to the first four, I’d be very happy he’s coming.
There’s a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it.
Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable we’re only workaday soldiers.
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves.
Stop eating?
Think about it carefully.
Your peace of mind depends on him.
Either go someplace private, or talk it over rationally, or else just go away.
Let’s carry him in triumph to his house!
A good plan, warrior king.
So Litio’s out of the picture.
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard.
Oh ho!
The food inside is warm, but you’re out here freezing.
Hang on, sir!
I’ve spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia.
Nym, what you say is true.
You can’t force me any more than Hermia can beg me.
Goodbye.
I’d give anything to keep them from seeing you here.
I swear, I’m telling you what I honestly think.
Please wear this ring.
I think she’ll be a better soldier.
There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks.
Oh!
What do you mean by “carriages”?
My wickedness?
This castle is in a pleasant place.
Absolutely—he is stuffed, like a dummy.
jailer, i’m your prisoner.
Don’t you hear it ring?
But is he often like this?
Let’s go.
I was wrong to her— Do you know how an oyster makes its shell?
I know you have no choice.
Let them in.
I’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker.
I won’t lodge any more than that under my roof.
Go on, master, and I will follow you—with truth and loyalty to my last breath.
When I said that, I told you the truth.
Your face is mine, and you have slandered it.
He’s given me a second life, and marrying her makes him a second father to me.
Whom should I knock?
We’re all waiting for the revenge!  
Caesar, you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you.
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it.
Tell me why, if you can.
Thank you, and God bless you for your hospitality.
In prison we’ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change.
Why don’t you go off to church dancing one way, and come home dancing another way?
In Rome, Madam.
It’s only just now nine o'clock.
Good news, friends.
Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues?
My doors were locked and I was shut out, right?
Knock at the gate?
I’ll confess to you that I love him.
Come here, monster, put some glue on your fingers, and carry away the rest of these clothes for us.
Take her to my tent.
Look, here come two noble animals, a man and a lion.
If you want to cry over my bad luck, I’ll give you my eyes.
Didn’t he come home last night?
Now, my dearest Queen— Please, stand farther away from me.
Murder, murder!
I beg your pardon, except for the widow Dido.
I don’t know,” he said, “any house, wife, or mistress.” My message, which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth, ended up being carried back home by my shoulders.
It will rain tonight.
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him.
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour.
Your words and actions don’t match up.
I’m critical by nature.
He doesn’t have any daughters, sir.
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods.
Oh,a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life.
Will you dine with me tomorrow?
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot?
I don’t know what you’ve done to upset him, but someone has challenged you to a duel.
Me too—otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio.
It would be much appreciated.
Have you heard about Albany’s and Cornwall’s troops?
Noble friends, let’s kill him boldly but not with anger.
Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son.
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much.
Now she’s gone forever.—Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a while.
Well, time will tell.
I saw that.
Come on.
Go with my brothers to my English peers.
Therefore, tremble with fear and leave.
That’s what I’m afraid of.
I hope to God Othello’s all right.
I’ll disguise myself as you and pour out “my” feelings to Hero, taking her prisoner with the force of my love story.
Have you heard anything to the contrary?
On, on, you noblest Englishmen, descended as you are from battle-tested fathers, fathers who, like so many Alexander the Greats, have fought in these regions from morning until night, sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight.
I have drawn my sword.
I’d hate to see you drowned in honey, sir.
Let’s hear what he has to say.
I’ve already slept, my lord.
Yes, really.
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden.
He’s done wrong, and his master the king will punish him for it.
Her name is Katherina Minola, famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue.
Your mother’s name has become a threat to her own children.
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it, but you started fighting with me first.
Is this possible?
Good morning, Catesby.
Did you just call me “beautiful”?
I certainly will, sir.
He once said the devil would get him because of women.
We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our goal.
Read the time there.
If we leave, it will feel like nothing less than death to them.
Where’s the evidence against me?
Just remember who you’ve got on board with you, good man.
I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then.
What’s going on, Horatio?
Who, him?
I’ll bleed to death.
Take on someone your own size: if you kill me, boy, you’ll have killed a man.
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks?
Thank you, sir.
Go ahead.
I’ve been poisoned.
I thought you were resolved to do this.
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man, but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself.
Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that!
Should we part, sweet girl?
Come forward and speak.
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched.
When will we get to the top of that cliff?
Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around!
This is unbelievable!
I have done the deed.
If you’re lying, I’ll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger.
Don’t talk to me, because I won’t say a word.
Rust inside my body and let me die.
I have the best armor in the world.
That’s a nice hat you’ve got there.
My lord, he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him, since he had no idea they were coming.
If this isn’t what you’ve been hoping for, I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever.
See, ladies, how they scorn me now.
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good!
I feel sicker and sicker.
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace.
Go ahead, use your authority.
I’ve only been hurt, not killed.
Bring him here and ask him.
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven?
There’s more to it than that.—Ganymede!
You have weapons?
It’s easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them.
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow. 
With Cassio?
The more I love him, the more he hates me.
Examine them yourselves, then bring me your findings.
How can I marry him, this husband, before he comes to court me?
Did you notice how the queen’s guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence’s death?
If it isn’t my old friend Grumio—and my dear friend Petruchio!
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas.
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man—a tiny spark in a cold body.
My lord, His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he’s placed a large bet on you.
Master, I’m all tied up for you.
Don’t be so quick to twist my meaning.
Hey, are you biting your thumb at us?
I don’t see any Thisbe.
Caius Ligarius doesn’t like Caesar, who berated him for speaking well of Pompey.
It’s true.
Should we just get down to it?
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical?
I say it’s the moon.
Signior Baptista, I’m actually in a bit of a hurry.
Go bring them all here; I give you power over them.
Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me.
How does he love me?
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners, or because you’re just stupid?
Oh, lovely.
And my king goes on: if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands, Henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face.
That’s why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears.
I recognize his walk.
Halt.
Who’s there, in the other devil’s name?
If I could make things better by lying, I’d deny it.
Ariel, go order my goblin servants to make these fellows' bones ache, give them muscle cramps all over, and give them more bruises than leopards have spots.
Take away this body, and do what I say.
Orlando.
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well, and now I need your help again.
You don’t love me.
Wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate?
Leave you alone!
I did not kill your husband.
What is your wish with regard to her?
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake.
Oh God, whose side I think I’m fighting on, look kindly on my forces.
I fear that your words and your heart are both false.
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian, as I asked you to do?
Look, and you’ll see.  
I’m game.
You are welcome, sir.
He’s a knight.
Madam, tell me quickly, what day is that?
You can’t judge me based on what I do tonight.  
I served Mark Antony, who was the commander most worthy of my services.
Help me!
Love cools off, friendships break up, and brothers become enemies.
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good?
Oh, what a sad sight!
Please, my friend, give me all the news, both good and bad, at the same time.
Gower is a good captain, and is well versed and well read in the wars.
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this?
It doesn’t matter.
Look who’s coming.
The worst thing imaginable has happened.
I remember his face well.
Good afternoon, my dear lord!
Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
There, take it, and thanks for taking such good care of me.
Good evening, brother.
She says you’re going to marry her.
What do you think of his belief?
Play with me, Charmian.
Boy, I beg you to run to the senate house.
Tell me why you did it.
And what did Surrey say to that?
But then he said strange things to me.
I’ll get my revenge before I leave this house.
When I meet this gentleman, I’ll tell him what you’ve said.
Draw your sword, scoundrel, or I’ll slice your thighs like flank steak.
What an excellent idea—he’ll soak up the wine!
We’re here to say “amen” to that.
Who’s the spokesman for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?
Follow me.
Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble.
Welcome, lady.
Look how she carries on with him!
I’ll finish my lecture after dinner.
You had rotten food, and he helped you eat it.
Believe what?
My lord, I’ll say goodbye now.     
Give him this deed and have him sign it.
shifts, friends, to Southampton.
You abused me to my face.
Pick up this rope ladder.
Okay, but please not before me.
Keep listening.
I’d be ashamed to give you this.
If you’re a virgin, you’ll answer this question.
Well, girl, you’re weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive.
Banquo and Donalbain, Malcolm!
Onward, lover boys!
They have to stay there.
I saw him holding the handkerchief!
The hell with her!
Are you crazy?
Your fortunes are the same.
A person can only pay with their life once, and she has paid in full.
Casca will tell us what’s the matter.
Some of those lines had more feet than the  That’s not a problem: the feet can bear Sure, but these feet were 
The battle on the sea is almost lost.
I beg your pardon.
It’s the wind.
My letters are ready to go.
Or if you follow me, you’d better understand that I’ll do something bad to you in the forest.
Yes, my good lord.
Places, everyone!
I’ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years.
But not a member of the royal family, like me.
Do you know whom you’re talking to?
That’s what I intend to do too.
What’s that sound?
Denmark’s a prison.
I will find the time to cry for you, Cassius, I’ll find the time.
Nerissa’s got the right idea.
But then again he’s never really understood his own feelings very well.
You may change your mind later.
What would you have said, my young York?
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender.
How could you ask?
You evil whore!
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck.
What, does the news only get worse?—Please, Bassanio, I’m half of you, so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you.
Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him.
But you’re wrong.
Murder?
Look!
Let me go with you.
I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do.
Monday, my lord.
That’s right.
You can’t trust them.
Or are you just teasing?
Come help me bless this couple, so they will be prosperous and have many children.
Eighty ducats in one shot!
But you were with him, weren’t you?
This man is probably like that.
We’ll have the wedding at the church tomorrow.
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey.
Liar and slave!
She always has to have a light next to her.
What woman wouldn’t be distressed, being lorded over by a handful of dust?
I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second meeting.
That’s a lame threat from a toy gun, a poor individual’s private displeasure with a monarch.
You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies.
What’s this, you dog?
If you steal my money, you’re just stealing trash.
I dreamt about this.
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh?
I won’t hurt him.
Do you think it’s a good idea to rush?
Is that possible?
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches.
We’re waiting here for you.
I’m no ordinary fairy.
It’s all right, since they left their food behind, and we’re hungry.
The generals want to speak with us.
Should I do it now?
I’m here, full of anger, to complain about my daughter Hermia.—Step forward, Demetrius.—My lord, this man, Demetrius, has my permission to marry her.—Step forward, Lysander.—But this other man, Lysander, has cast a magic spell over my child’s heart.—You, you, Lysander, you’ve given her poems, and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter.
My father’s studying hard, so he won’t see you.
Go back, slave, or I’ll knock you one across the head.
What did he say the symptoms were?
No ship could survive this storm.
Yes, and Wall too.
Go to your cabins and be quiet!
I know you.
Hey!
Good luck, sir.
Don’t be afraid of greatness.” That was well written.
And Trinculo’s drunk.
Are you sure of that?
From now on I’ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out, “Enough, enough!” and disappears.
Now they work for me.
What’s going on here, general?
Don’t say “banishment.” From now on, you are banished from Verona.
My heart, which dried out with grief, will surely break apart into a powder, and that will be the end of my disgusting mind.
Imagine, when we talk of horses, that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth.
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel, but that’s just engraved on the surface.
You gentle Romans— Quiet there!
But as soon as the sun rises in the east, my sad son comes home to escape the light.
My name is Edgar, and I’m your father’s son.
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep.
Look, let’s stay here tonight.
And I have much less to comfort me than you do, since I’ve lost my daughter.
To show you that that’s me, let me prove it a little even in this case.
I didn’t have the heart to say no to him.
Leave, you little man.
You lover of that damned whore, you’re talking to me of “ifs”?
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty?
If I’m more noble than you, you’ve done me wrong.
Are my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
I’d rather see you having fun, because we have friends coming who want to have fun.
Stay here.
You’re in a good mood tonight, my lord.
I told him we’ll stay for at least a month, and he says that he hopes we’ll stay longer.
The Turkish navy will be broken up.
Indeed you did, and more besides, Miranda.
Therefore, when he has reason to fear, as we do, his fears are without question of the same order.
She can stay at her father’s house.
Who is leading his men?
Between whom?
Come, mistress Kate, I’ll join you.
As you know, next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married. 
Come with me and I’ll get it for you.
Bring the villain forward.
But please, tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius.
The present time is like a woman in labor, each minute giving birth to some piece of news.
He’s dead.
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern?
Oh Buckingham, now I’m going to test to see if you’re truly made of gold.
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks.
But still, she’s going to kill you for being gone so long.
Your grace, please forgive me.
My stupid heart, which I’m leaving behind here.
You look pale and wild as if you’re going to hurt yourself.
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him, as it does this good king’s blood.
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth.
Well, start thinking about marriage now.
Sometimes I think I’m no smarter than average.
Ask it something, Horatio.
Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name, right?
Oh, just lies, sir.
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep.
I don’t care if you love me or not, I like the cap and I’ll have it or I won’t have any.
And I’ll be eternally grateful to you.  
Hurry, hurry!
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress.
Come here, Leonato.
Oh, it’s horrible of her.
Sit between us.
Get him to say his prayers, Sir Toby, get him to pray.
Or, if you don’t mind, come to my home, and I’ll wait for you.
I don’t know.
You have to contradict me, do you?
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb?
Close, soft eyes.
I feel better already, and I know there’s more good advice where that came from.
The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions.
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes!
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field.
Where’s your father?
Oh, Kate, prudish customs bow before great kings.
You’re not going, sir.
Is it now afternoon?
So, if all turns out fine, as you say, it’s more than we deserve or I expect.
Until the day we die, my lord.
Is it possible?
No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy.
He’s calling us back.
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself?
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it.
Orsino, sir, please don’t call me those names.
Oh wise judge!
I’ll bring you to him right away.
Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier?
Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
He may command me as my king, but you still have power over me as a relative.
Take a trumpet, herald.
Where?
Just read it.
But who’s coming?
Oh yes, you spoke, my lord, but total nonsense.
It is an honor that I do not dream of.
Farewell, good neighbor.
What strange reason could she have for coming here?
There’s a spirit in here!
Come on, give me your best shot.
And what if they won’t go?
Thank you, Ariel.
toward his own father who loves him so completely.
But surely you’re not planning to 
Bassanio, the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone.
My lord, you don’t need to apologize.
I wasn’t invited because they like me.
I’m going to sell all my land.
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities.
I can’t explain it.
If I had three ears I’d listen with all three.
It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy.
Well, did you think about what I said?
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields, and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep.
Very soon, because you want it.
No, he’s a devil—a devil, I tell you!
Ring the alarm bell.
How are you, Sir Toby Belch?
Listen to me patiently.
Two or three of us have seen strange things.
I want to head out tonight.
What a spoiled little brat.
Come on and kiss me, Kate.
Perhaps you’ve learned from life and not from books.
I swear, you speak the truth.
Look—they’re crying.
Everything is gloomy, dark, and dreadful.
I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner’s call is to keep her from sleeping—
Ah, I’m an odd kind of guy.
Stay close by when we wake him up, ma'am.
Here’s the hut, my lord.
The news I have to tell your majesty is that Buckingham’s army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall.
Be quiet, boy, or you’ll lose your mind.
But that’s another story.
Will you wait awhile?
While I was looking for a flint to light it, I found this paper on the window, sealed up like this, and I’m sure it wasn’t there when I went to bed.
I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop.
May I kiss your feet?
Come on, servant, come.
Two reasons.
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive.
God, that song’s even better than the other one.
None, my lord.
No, no.
No.
That’s a deal.
We understand you’re just doing it for us, and we’ll be sure to say so.
Let me live here forever.
Have some others search.
Goodnight, Michael.
I think that on a night like this, when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn’t make a sound,  On a night like this,  On a night like this,  On a night like this, 
Do as I told you.
Unnatural acts will cause  Good night, good doctor.
We’re ruined!
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind, so you may believe me.
That’s enough, Dromio, please.
When evil is dominant, death soon kills the body like cancer.
Evil can come from good, just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we have to walk carefully.
How are you doing?
Just looking at him gives me heartburn.
Let’s hear it.
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms.
Your mistress’s marks?
Now, tell me—which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first?
Have you spoken to him?
They say Gloucester’s bastard son is.
A woman more beautiful than the one I love?
Hello, sir.
The other half goes to the state.
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, please go find my lady Olivia— Get out, demon!
Call in my maid.
It’s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up.
I’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me.
Oh, look, sir, look, sir!
I will sit here in the middle.
Tell us your name, sir, truthfully.
And after this I’ll be good and hope you forgive me.
Either the lovers have different social standings—
Don’t mess with me.
You’re acting like an ass, don’t you think?
The hell with order!
She can’t hurt you, Helena.
What do you want?
Goodbye.
I had business that made me late.
Oh, and I know who loves him.
Clearly, men should not go out walking too late!
I heard him swear he did.
Oh, noise?
It’s my birthday.
Then a third of the world is drunk.
Welcome, gentlemen.
Do you see something wrong with that?
What’s your name?
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves, my sister drowned.
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered.
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me, who cut her sweet prince’s life short and made her a widow?
Lucius, wake up!
Who’s been with her?
Well, give me the worst news.
Who do you think?
How short am I?
Tyrant, show your face!
Now go!
You horrid slave, you can’t be trained to be good, and you’re capable of anything evil!
We’ll talk about this later.
Why Dover?
Over there, where Titinius mourns it.
And even though I’m in a distasteful mood, I’ll work on being happy.
He’s an unremarkable man, fit only to be sent on errands.
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once.
The more I try to hide what I’m feeling, the bigger it gets.
Oh God—who is, by the way, the best comic of them all.
I see that you are poor.
Who can stain that name with a just accusation?
From head to toe?
I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news.
Farewell, farewell.
My master’s house.
Welcome to Cyprus.
What, are you trying to make me crazy?
Here comes the king, the queen, and the noblemen of court.
It’s time to put our armor on.
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi, responding to our challenge before we’ve even challenged him.
I beg you not to do this, my lord.
Oh, I’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes!
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony.
Please, tell me more.
What’s the “seventh cause”?
We’ll listen to him.
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do, you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena.
I lent my body once to make him rich.
A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution.
Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo.
There goes a strong fellow, Menas.
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God, the law, my honor, and her feelings?
Oh, my lady, I’m ashamed to admit it.
I think you’re my mirror, not my brother.
Well, praise the Lord you’re ugly.
Why couldn’t you be attended by my servants, or by Regan’s?
A knight on a quest?
Six pence a day would’ve been forced on him.
You’re in your own kingdom, sir.
Listen!
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants?
If he wakes up before we kill him, he’ll never stop punishing us.
I think so.
I am not treacherous.
Draw your sword and get on your toes, because your assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.
Is his army approaching?
I’m being repaid for that now.
Nurse, where’s my daughter?
And, make no mistake, you’ll find, as we his subjects have, an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now.
Do you remember the circumstances?
Yes, we get the idea.
That’s true.
Did I work to make him king for this?
I’m positively stuffed with air, I eat so much of it.
Tell them you know that Hero loves me.
No.
Nice and short and full of good sense—or should I say nonsense?
Oh, this is treachery!
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her.
What should we say, my lord?
Oh, has it come to this?
If it’s really you, tell me what happened to our son, who floated away with you on that deadly raft.
Sir, welcome to our house.
I could drown the world.
So, perhaps, did yours.
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you.
I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift.
No, a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings.
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go.
My liege.
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast, ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea.
I’ll have glory in this losing day—more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest.
If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful.
Well, then, be brave and pretend to be a man.
Which one of you is Beatrice?
He’s my prisoner and you can’t have him.
It eases the spirit.
I love my master, and he’ll find me very hard-working.
We’re off, Biondello.
As good a reason as any.
My plans take me a roundabout way.
Madam, there’s a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you.
Who’s that?
I had a round with him, and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can’t even duck out of the way.
But no beautiful woman has an honest face.
But who is this?
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt.
What do you think about him, Cassio?
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave.
Do you hear that, Charmian?
I do, Mark Antony.
What we do we have been commanded to do.
I hope I see him and hear him again soon.
Give me your love instead, as I give you mine.
What dangers are you trying to lead me into, Cassius, that you want me to look inside myself for something that’s not there?
You liar, you’re turning my heart to stone, and making me call what I’ll do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice!
Check and see if he’s breathing.
And if I, your poor devoted servant, may ask you for one small favor, you will guarantee my happiness forever.
I can’t speak anymore.
Oh, come quickly!
But if she can’t love you, sir?
Well, let’s go on.
Lady!
And you’ve come at a good time, so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won’t come today.
Oh wife, look at how our daughter bleeds!
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise, I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine, because if you’d been what I took you for, there would have been no offense.
I’ll watch this play.
Only my free will—nothing else.
I meant they had to give her credit.
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself.
You mean I should groan and tell you?
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown, just a small circlet—and, as I told you, he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it.
Have you come to make confession to this father?
Why, he has an income of three thousand ducats a year.
No, the man who cannot extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever.
He doesn’t seem to be alive.
Why “puppet”?—Oh, I see where this is going.
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart?
What’s that noise?
Oh no!
Oh friendly friar!
Not by the likes of you!
That’s a good way of putting it.
Why shouldn’t she take my hand, father?
They did want me to tell her, but I persuaded them that, if they truly loved Benedick, they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark.
If your Majesty would like, I’ll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like.
I know his soul’s in heaven, fool.
A hundred and sixty-eight hours?
Excuse me, sir, do you know how to read?
Your vote will be as strong as anyone’s in the reordering of the government.
Why shouldn’t I be there in person?
You get only one round.
By the end I will either live, or else I’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood.
I don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side, or if he secretly aided the rebels, or if he fought with both of our enemies.
We’ll drive them to a 
Well then, good bye, my lord.
Believe me, I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins.
Aren’t you Kent?
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad.
By the god Jupiter above, I swear “No.” By Jupiter’s wife Juno, I swear “Yes.” They wouldn’t dare.
Does it really make sense, once we divide the world into three parts, that he should be one of the three rulers?
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly?
So she is drowned.
Please, get some excellent music, because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window.
She only appears honorable from the outside.
The more you beat me, the more I’ll love you.
You ass!
You understand?
I’m dying to hear your life story, which must be a strange tale.
Yes, I guarantee he won’t drown—even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman.
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity.
That’s a good thing to put in—it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law.
True, noble prince.
There’s a knocking at the gate.
Too late, good Diomedes.
Hey, if I lay down my “ Welcome, Lorenzo and Salerio.
You should mock me    I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg.
There are two opposite elements in everything, in men as well as in herbs—good and evil.
Don’t be crass.—You all look confused.
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees?
He’s safe, Antony.
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind!
I’m not like you.
You can’t trust all the rumors.
I can’t let my lips say his name; “No man must know.”
I know the man well.
Don’t try to tempt me!
Why do you sound so odd?
That’s why I praise myself, who—if I do say so myself—is quite praiseworthy.
When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss.
You attract me to you, you cruel magnet!
Kent, if you want to stay alive, stop talking.
My honorable, reverend master?
Ha!
creet.
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you?
Well, that’s the same thing.
And at the base of Pompey’s statue, with his cloak covering his face, which was dripping with blood the whole time, great Caesar fell.
In the meantime, I’ll raise an army that will surpass his.
You won’t be striking me down, but defeating Caesar.
Come out, beautiful sun—until I’ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in, I’ll watch my shadow as I stroll along.
I have it ready for you.
Fulvia?
What are you doing here alone?
What a farce!
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king.
I hope that’s all he loses.
And I see a lot of Orlando here.
You have my word as a gentleman that I’ll always be grateful to you.
How could that happen?
I urge you to deliver your verdict.
I never gave him any token of romantic love.
But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it.
Where the devil can Romeo be?
I’m ready and waiting.—Give me your hand, Bassanio.
What worries have kept you awake tonight?
Fortune is happy today and, in this mood, will give us anything we want.
You’re going to ask me why I’d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats.
Good morning, General.
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there.
Master, master!
It looks like you’ve offended it.
Her father loves you, Demetrius.
What’s the news, brave soldier?
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret, Hero’s servant woman, likes me.
Asses are made for bearing, and so are you.
I want my bond.
Look, it’s going away.
Yes.
His name is Tyrrel, my lord.
Oh, why is this so?
Oh no, my reasons are deep and as permanent as death.
Where is my husband?
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves.” As much as he deserves—wait a minute there, Morocco, and consider your own value with a level head.
You’re absolutely right.
I’m not.
If that’s not the case, then this must be the answer: You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight.
Hang him immediately.
Mr. Fabian, stay with this gentleman until I come back.
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand—what’s her name now?
My lord, no one will believe this in Venice, even though I’d swear I saw it with my own eyes.
I’ll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of.
Tell me what you are.
She’s gone forever.
I’ll only admit that you’re sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother’s soul.
Who should hang them?
But yet, madam— I don’t like the sound of “but yet.” It reverses all the good that came before it.
Let me see what he looks like, so when I see another man who resembles him, I’ll know to avoid him.
There’s a similar mark on her arm. 
I’m sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities.
Farewell, King.
He’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans.
Your grave is gaping open, and your death is near.
You call yourself my wife, yet you don’t call me “husband”?
Do you doubt I’ll write?
Show them in.
I’m not who I appear to be.
I know I won’t please you.
If you don’t repay me on the day we agree on, in the place we name, for the sum of money fixed in our contract, your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh, to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like.
I could imagine he’s divine, since I never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before.
Battered armor, be off.
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart.
You come from heaven, don’t you?
Gracious brother, I will go with them.
Antipholus, you hear how the man pleads with me.
You can give good news in many ways, but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it.
His father was Philip of Macedon, as I remember.
Get information from her.
Soldiers, watch carefully.
But, tell me, is young George Stanley alive?
What do you think that means?
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well.
What do I see here?
The wide ocean doesn’t prevent them from coming to see her—they travel across it as if it were a little stream.
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve.
Yes, leave that labor to great Hercules—it’s worse than the previous twelve put together.  
I don’t think there’s anywhere I’d rather die than in the king’s company, as his cause is just and honorable.
Welcome, my good Alexas.
What, is he dead?
Here lies Hero, The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words.
No, my friends, don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well.
What are you accused of?
You and your servant are very funny, sir.
I’ve had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice.
Well then, can’t I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow?
Look, she’s come home from confession with a happy look on her face.
Do whatever you like with it.
And what of all this?
She’s Phoebe-ing me.
And I for Rosalind.
Speak, I command you.
Death has sucked the honey from your breath, but it has not yet ruined your beauty.
Yes, unfortunately.
We’re ruined, lady, we’re ruined!
Have all his business ventures failed?
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as witnesses.
Those of you who are young and active, I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do.
We’re searching on land, but he’s lost in the sea.
There is no jewel like Rosalind.
What would you like, Laertes?
All three of us will marry now in death.
Ouch, what a comeback!
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications.
He’ll stay as long as I say.
Well, get out of here then!
What do you think, girl!
You’ve pretended to be in love with her, singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight, and you’ve captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair, rings, toys, trinkets, knickknacks, little presents, flowers, and candies—things that can really influence an impressionable young person.
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you, either in his words or his face?
Should we go see the sights in the town?
When a great person departs, it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body.
That’s right.
I’m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed.
Today was the day I breathed my first breath.
No!
Oh, noble weakness!
He said “Goodbye, madam,” and nothing else.
Show me, show me.
No, I’ve had my say.
That’s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander.
But come, my lord, let’s go.
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet.
I am a spirit, yes, since I have a soul.
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours, my courage as great, and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown.
Oh, Regan, Goneril, your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything—Oh, if I think about that I’ll go mad.
Are you a man?
Oh, say it, and mean it!
Go and get our stuff onto the ship.
To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way.
I think you’ve been frowning too much recently.
I’ll just stay here till the storm passes.
I’m off to visit my friends in Padua—particularly my best friend Hortensio.
That’s the necklace I gave you, sir.
Well, first of all, my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out.
What, not even to pray?
What did my man say?
Gave me, sir?
Good morning, sweet Hero.
I’m not sure about that.
Or was it a blessing that we came here?
Madam, keep up hope.
Noses, ears, lips.
I’m not a traitor, unfair lady.
Say something.
Yes, my lord?
Beat the drum.
Thank you.
And no one eat any onions or garlic.
And is “pig” not the same as “great,” may I ask?
Do you lie so low?
What, are you sleepy?
Oh, who did this thing?
It’s almost morning.
Give it to me!
Will they stop working when their voices mature?
This is going even better than I planned.
But let me try my luck on the boxes.
Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips?
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture.
Take a few steps—I want to see you walk.
I’ll sue him for assault and battery, if there’s any justice in Illyria.
No, I’ll help too.
Has it come to this?
His ships are maneuverable.
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick.
And why do you blame me for loving you?
I think I can guess what you’re about to say.
You look like you have something more to say.
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers.
No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock strike.
No, it’s permanent.
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex?
Can you help me?
What, in our own house?
The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know.
Please forgive me, master.
You’d be a pitiful bird.
Tell them to capture me, then sell my bones.
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.
I shall, King Harry.
Discipline must be kept.
Enough!
But she, your subject, hates such a king.
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match.
It would’ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did.
Othello’s wife has a lot of influence now.
And even though you know I’m very close to the Prince and Claudio, I swear I’ll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly.
And yet, against all odds, I win her over!
Isn’t it strange, Canidius, that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne?—Have you heard about this, sweet?
I know I can do it.
No, just help me unpin this.
Don’t think I blame you.
Well, learn to make jokes at the appropriate time.
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light.
Quiet!
I swear, old fools become like babies again.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, and you, Sir Walter Herbert, are going to stay with me.
God help Claudio!
Bring her out, brother.
Sorry, sir, Goodman Verges tends to ramble.
Exactly.
We don’t come here with the intention of making you happy.
The honest men.
She’s as dead as the cold ground.
I’ve got no hope that he survived.
That’s very sensible, but you missed my sense: I meant Hortensio is afraid of you.
Divide each man into a thousand, and there you will have an imaginary army.
I’m very sick, too.
I still have room for six more wounds.
And that’s true—he  Then I pleaded for you.
You devil, you’ve put a spell on her!
I wonder why Cambio hasn’t shown up in all this time.
She’s the one who’s got to do it.
Look, if you really love the beautiful Hero, enjoy it.
Yes, I do.
Make me believe it?
We’ll put a picture of you on a sign, right above the words “Come see the tyrant!” I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm, or be taunted by the common people.
It means peace and love and a quiet life, supremacy based on reverence and profound respect, and—not to go on and on about it—everything that’s sweet and happy.
Where’s the gold I gave you?
And I’ll help you.
He won’t get the better of me.
But in that “no hope” there are great hopes for you!
Come, night.
I work for Titania, the Fairy Queen, and organize fairy dances for her in the grass.
I’ll disguise myself in somber robes.
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio’s life?
And my sweet master, I received no gold.
Can I have a word with you?
No, you have to call me Rosalind.—Sister, you’re coming?
Sure, I hate her, but I wouldn’t hurt her.
But soon I’ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father.
I’d be as right for the job as you are, and I’d do it more easily, since I’d have good will on my side.
But where will we go?
She’s dead, deceased, she’s dead.
If that means I don’t care about anything, you should disappear right now, since you’re nothing.
Oh, what a villain I am!
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful.
Don’t say that, Lysander.
Is that his answer?
You have the nerve to call me daughter?
Return to the gracious duke, good Catesby.
How can we tell which of us is the oldest?
Hey, open the door!
And I’m telling you it was burnt and dried out.
There isn’t any kindness in the snake.
For the love of God, be patient with him.
Is Horatio here too?
Your servant Kent.
Your death would prevent that.
I heard the galloping of horses.
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry’s return to France.
Stand away from the body.
Doesn’t it look like the king?
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation—if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years.
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury.
Cleopatra— Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about?
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind.
Wait, countrymen.
Here’s an empty seat, sir.
No more foolish talk.
Who has wronged him?
I’m involved in your rivalry.
Where is he, in his bed?
Lepidus is red in the face.
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this!
Now the time is right for us to speak, and we do so with imperial authority.
We must not.
So they are possibly Antony’s friends.
Where is Malvolio?
Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste.
The sweet fool in a fool’s costume—that’s me.
Please, leave it here.
I don’t like it that you knew about this, Iago.
No, that’s not true.
And I’m her father as well.
Oh God, do I have to remember that?
Two of them are completely honorable, and if they have been tricked in this, we must blame John the Bastard, who lives to create conflict.
Please keep in mind we’re only here out of spite.
Oh, stop, fool.
There’s something else to be done.
But you’re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly, vulgar, and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel.
Not me.
Good Cinna, take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge’s chair where Brutus sits, so he’ll find it.
Oh, but there’s one more thing to tell you.
When only one or two men have all the good manners, and even they are dirty, things are bad.
No one admires speed more than the lazy.
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady?
Will it?
I’ll get there first and tell him what we found out.
I’m sick, Charmian.
Have you heard this, Cassio?
Will you go hide?
That’s an oath of great power, and our fury must subside.
You know, if you were anyone other than Brutus, that speech would be your last.
We will, my noble lord.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, while I with equal affection welcome yours.
You’re so infatuated with him that you’re hallucinating.
Go ahead, Moon.
If that’s true, then don’t be tongue-tied.
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband.
But once he got there, the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola.
My fears can’t actually make you evil.
And she’s fierce, even though she’s little.
Help, my lord of Norfolk, help, help!
If you love me, let me know by smiling at me.
Have you written that down, that they aren’t criminals?
Regan gives good advice.
What do you mean, your highness?
As for the Jew’s contract, don’t let it be a factor in your plans.
Death is the best way to cover over her shame.
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
Cassio’s a handsome man.
Can’t what, my lord?
In my travels, great scholars have come up to me, meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches, and I have seen them tremble and turn pale, and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences, and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they’re so nervous, and then break off abruptly at the end, without actually welcoming me.
Did you leave on good terms?
I was sure that you hadn’t given it to me.
Your Majesty didn’t present yourself as the king.
My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight.
Do you know the way to Dover?
Sir, do you know who I am?
What further pain must I endure in my old age?
You, good friend, save me a piece of marzipan, and if you love me, have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
I’d rather die.
He was my friend, he was faithful and just to me.
Do so.
I never—oh, what a mistake!—revealed myself to him until half an hour ago, when I was in my armor.
Please, father, I beg you.
Your fate awaits you.
If you refuse to allow me to do so, your city’s charter and its freedom are endangered.
People say he’s generous, well educated, and brave, and he’s very attractive.
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession.
How did he try to persuade you to love him?
That whore?
Yes.
You’d think everyone was asleep.
Oh, give us permission, great king, to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies.
There!
Appear before me now quickly— No talking.
But as it stands, I wish I could believe it wasn’t.
If any ships are sailing, I’ll get right on one.
If you can’t, and would prefer to leave, she’s very willing to say goodbye to you.
Then I’ll smack you on the head with the serving-creature’s knife.
Okay, now it starts!
What do you believe?
If you’re Stephano, touch me and speak to me.
Oh, Antony, Antony, Antony!
Why are you looking for me?
I beg you, listen well.
If you’re someone who gets into fights, I’ll fight with you.
Can I go away while my heart stays here?
To save her life, I’ll say she doesn’t.
No, I swear, I don’t even know what’s in it.
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
What else did you hear?
And I’ve been avoiding him all day.
Tom will chase them off.—Go away, you mongrels!
Please wait, sir.
Good roaring, Lion!
Oh, look!
Here he comes back.
No, my lord.
Will you come immediately?
Now, please, I beg you, don’t work so hard.
You can’t mean it, Tranio!
Ready to set sail, sir?
But when I say so, I swear she turns white as a sheet.
Well then, the beef without the mustard.
What a fine sight!
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up.
So I will, my liege.
Tell me the truth.
Harder, harder.
I hate him so much it makes me sick, and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy.
They were paid to betray their master.
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do, we can almost forget our own misery.
This is a pitiful sight!
Thank you very much.
Good madam, restrain yourself.
Please don’t, sir.
You know, uncle, A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow’s head off.
Fight valiantly today.
This is the day I’m going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me.
Brutus, what will we do?
Oh, make them joyful!
No, my lord.
She hangs around me all the time.
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry?
Whether you are sad or merry, the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .
I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment.
Ophelia, come here.—   I hear him coming.
I don’t think so, my lord.
Good morning to you, friend.
Go away.
They’re as opposite as hot and cold.
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life.
If not, come when you have the courage.
I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave.
They sit chatting by the parlor fire.
Whatever you see first when you wake up, think of it as your true love.
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I have offended.
You talk like a child, but you’re very smart anyway.
Do you think so?
As I was working on one musty room, the Prince and Claudio entered.
I have to make do.
Do you have your answer yet?
What is she saying, my lord?
Fine.
Show me, or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt.
This poor guy’s partly confessed his plan.
Listen, Fairy King.
Finally the new moon, curved like a silver bow in the sky, will look down on our wedding celebration.
Hey, mistress!
CALIBAN  Stephano!
Say I will love her everlastingly.
What!
My lord, you used to like me.
I’ll make ground beef out of you.
He doesn’t miss a thing.
That it was, sir.
There, Leonato, take your daughter back.
That’s me you’re talking about, the playful wanderer of the night.
If I don’t do all this, never trust me again.
For a full half hour.
You’re in love?
Go to bed, dear.
You’ll just have to be patient for a little while.
Take your penalty.
Absolutely, if you can find a wife by then.
Oh, brother Montague, give me your hand.
I do hate 
I’d never do such a bad thing, not for the whole world!
I don’t like his face.
I, who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals?
Fool, do not flatter yourself.
And it’s good to have joy in such a joyless time.
Name him.
Don’t stay to answer me—get going.
With crisscrossed laces?
God be with you.
I didn’t, my lord.
Well, I’ll get married one day, just to see.
Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all?
Hey!
I haven’t slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar.
God be with you and keep you, and may he heal your head.
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction —son against father.
No, madam, I’m just reading an insane letter.
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?
I’ll give my vile body back to the earth.
Here comes my man, the man I’m looking for.
It’s wrong for the duke to do this.
Of course we will.
But the way he’s divided the kingdom recently, nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more.
What?
I swear to God I’ll get revenge.
There was even more foolishness, if I could only remember it.
But I’ll write again to Mantua, and I’ll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes.
Hello, everyone!
To the Forest of Arden, to find your father.
Only children are afraid of scary pictures.
What’s going on, Othello, darling?
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud, showy ferocity, too, leaving their brains behind with their wives.
Sir, don’t even try to beat me in a battle of wits.
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts!
Go, Mardian, and let me know how he reacts to my death. 
If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealth’s sake, treat her with more kindness.
They’re very anxious for you to get there.
You don’t need eyes to see how the world works.
So, where should we eat? 
This one, and I will give her to you.
Without doubt I’ve heard that.
Good day to you, sir.
Farewell, kind lord.
It is, my lord.
Why did you cry out in your sleep?
An annoying schoolboy, unworthy of such an honor, joined by a masquerader and a partier!
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia.
Lovely Beatrice, I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that.
Pardon, dear father.
Call my knights together.
You are only a soldier.
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler?
No, I didn’t say that.
Is that true?
Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed.
Let’s go at it, coward!
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops.
Dolabella, I will always be in debt to you.
But sir— Be quiet, Kent.
I feel awful for my cousin.
This box was tested in the fire seven times.
But I’ll go out of spite, to feed off the wasteful Christian.—Jessica, my girl, watch the house.
That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.
Madam, if you can find a man to deliver the poison, I’ll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it.
Here, sir!
And I for no woman.
There wasn’t any problem.
I intend to be flesh and blood, not airy philosophy, for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently, even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune.
I’ll give it back to you.
No, boy.
Alas, I am the mother of all these others' griefs.
Here comes Kent.
You have a daughter named Elizabeth, who is virtuous and beautiful, aristocratic and full of grace.
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land.
Hello there, good sirs.
Poor poisonous fool, be angry and bite.
Take him off to jail!
But never mind them—if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would’ve forgiven him.
That’s just how he is.
I hope to God it’s something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you.
You’d better think up a way to defend yourself.
A loud-mouthed, drunken monster.
The same to you, my lord!
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog.
You should always be honest.
Hello and God bless you, sir.
But here come some people, right in the nick of time.  
An era of universal peace is about to start.
Cousins, you all have work to do.—Oh, I beg your pardon.
He’s dead.
Noble Antony, even illness couldn’t keep me away.
I’m speaking purely in analogies and comparisons.
They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony.
Knowing how much I loved my books, he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom.
Shame on you, you slanderer!
See—I’ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name.
Don’t go out today.
Noble Buckingham, your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart.
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water, unable to move.
Fine!” he says.
She’s too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven’s blessing by making me despair.
Tongue, do not speak.
It’s good to grow.
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not.
I am dying!—My lord, you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished.
What’s that noise?
How sound asleep she is!
You’ll be lord of the island then, and I’ll be your servant.
Goodbye, sir.
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony’s former soldiers—enough to capture him.
Tell me, if your dark powers can see this far: will Banquo’s sons ever reign in this kingdom?
Oh my!
He exposed Edgar’s murderous plot, and was wounded, as you see there, when trying to apprehend him.
I don’t think there’s a man under the sun who’s worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard.
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman.
I’ve said nothing wrong.
Goodbye.
Sport?
They’re ready whenever you are.
Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial.
Let me tell you, my friend, I’m almost insane myself.
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers.
I don’t think about them now.
My lord, Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room.
I don’t have any “brilliant” reason for it, but I have a good enough reason.
Now he’s ready for 
Sailors, sir.
You’re a traitor.—Off with his head.
Fool!
They burn for revenge.
My letters say only seventy senators were killed, one being Cicero.
But please don’t let any of your people wake me up.
As I came down?
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance, to feed my innocent people.
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city.
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth.
I don’t know how to ask you for forgiveness, but I have to say something.
And a bad singer, my lord.
Biondello, go and tell your mistress to come to me.
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him.
Uncle of Exeter, release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me.
It’ll be lunchtime within an hour.
He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . .
Please, keep it to yourself.
You’re a funny man, sir.
Got it, sir.
If you ever loved me, then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile, and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story.
No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you.
Cheer up, good Adam.
Now it’s time to get your costumes together.
I’ll hound him.
Amen.
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart.
There, take it all back—plates, cups, the whole thing.
Go, girl, look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days.
I don’t know that, once he knows what I know.
Keep an eye on her, Moor.
Please, do me this one favor: find out what I’ve done to offend this knight.
We want to hear the will.
Love can make worthless things beautiful.
Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed.
Edmund, go find him.
Who are you?
Don’t ask why.
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house.
For standing up for this unpopular king.
All the rumors have been confirmed.
Did you call for me, your Worship?
I’m still a virgin.
Well, we all have our special gifts.
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey.
Yes, a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world, in fact.
Good night.
Remember you!
No, don’t even mention him.
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head?
My ships will come home a month before the money is due.
With all my heart, Phoebe.
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant’s heart, to be cut off by him.—But please have mercy.
Now, by St. George, my knighthood, and my crown— The first you profaned, the second you dishonored, and the third you stole.
But leave it all to God.
It’s another Hero!
Who is this fool?
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away.
Have my brother-in-law’s troops been mobilized?
Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.
And I regret having bragged to the messenger about how my enemies were being butchered at Pomfret while I, as I said, was in good standing with Richard.
Though this island may appear desolate—  
So it is on earth.
Sometimes she rides over a courtier’s lips, and he dreams of making money off of someone.
I’m very glad to see you.
I know you’re the right person for this job.
I wish it were over.
Come on, get ready.
I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever.
Let’s sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed.
Let me sit down.
It will heal and be as good as new, and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again.
I can’t admit that, since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine.
And be a happy mother by doing so.
But was this near the shore?
Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon, whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire, whether your intentions are good or evil, you look so strange I want to talk to you.
How would you woo her?
You have ruined my innocent child.
Sir, is everyone in your family at home?
You say the king is losing his mind.
But I’m afraid we’ll never get him to agree to be king.
What about that?
Then no man has ever been honest.
Shut up.
I was bound to him an hour ago, sir, but thankfully he chewed through our ropes.
Wear both the ring and my heart, because both are yours.
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much?
I won’t have any of this.
If they’d put you in the stocks for asking that question, you would’ve deserved it.
It was worse than being a captive in chains.
Please, Rosalind, my sweet cousin—be happy.
I’ve got you now, pagan.
Come on, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Yes, and these.
Hurry up, my Jewish friend.
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes—politely—before you begin your match.
Honestly, I didn’t see it, but I felt it in her hot breath.
If it’s fighting he is after, some of us here should run and hide.
My own house, good lady.
Where did he go?
It’s best just to let him go.
He’s out of his right mind.
If I die before you do make sure I’m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin.
Absolutely not.
She is not sick, my lord, but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping.
Therefore, accept my everlasting farewell.
Where are the thousand 
He’s the color of nutmeg.
Only three so far?
Yes, we are.
What kind of fighting cock is this?
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time?
You’ve described a warm friend who’s cooling off.
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine.
You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength.
Are your doors locked?
What is the name of the castle that stands over there?
Show yourself in the form of a sigh.
We’ll let you.
If he’s not around, bring his brother Oliver to me.
I’m telling you, it’s hers.
Not so fast.
How’s everyone in Verona?
Don’t push him too far.
We’ll win yet.
But why couldn’t I say “Amen”?
Sing it tonight.
I didn’t think you could even be so angry.
There isn’t much time.
Again, goodbye.
We argued about which was best, and now we won’t get either one.
Look at Macbeth—he’s in a daze.
Then run away.
Well, the poor man died by your first order, which was carried by a winged messenger.
Well, good luck!
So the cooks who can’t lick their fingers aren’t hired.
But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man.
What’s the matter with you, madam?
No, no, with God’s help, his son will be king.
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was.
Watch Cassius.
If not, he’s got truth on his side!
Yes, I did, my lord.
I desperately needed God’s blessing, but the word “Amen” stuck in my throat.
What, are we having a feast?
Forgotten you!
No, sit down.
This play isn’t right for you.
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this.
I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking.
In this world, I’m only taking up space.
That’s true.
My name is Pistol.
If I were my father, cousin, would I do this?
Be good enough to hear me out.
Take pity on Poor Tom, who is persecuted by the devil.
Quick, let’s hide, my lord.
Maybe it’s a parade to welcome us to town, master.
Good monster!
Nevertheless, it’s all one—the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers, and there are salmon in both.
You don’t know me, but I know you’re an important person.
Knock, knock, knock!
Treat Desdemona well.
Which ones are the malefactors?
What’s with you, my lord?
I’m tired and feeling heavy, but I can’t sleep.
There were many even more memorable feasts.
Do you want to sink?
How is lieutenant Cassio?
Who measured the ground?
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you.
And so, good Capulet—which is a name I love like my own name—you should be satisfied with what I say.
Oh ho, oh ho!
No, no, the bell.
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow?
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a trouble just the same.
Cheer up.
You’re snoring, but it sounds like you’re talking.
Madam, I’m here.
My lord!
There was no end to his generosity.
There’s two—a man and a woman.
Damn those words, “but yet!” “But yet” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal.
Oh, no, he’s surely not in hell.
Our country weeps, it bleeds, and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds.
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing.
What?
You’re all lazy and shallow.
Royal seductress!
You can ride him easily, and he responds well when you pull the reins.
Where are you taking me?
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from, has rejected me!
Well, her name’s a word, and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore.
Yes, I found him when he was asleep—so that’s taken care of too—and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him.
The world’s a liar.
I’ll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing.
I can’t ask you to make my daughter live—that’s impossible—but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died.
The coroner’s inquest law.
Are you indeed?
She’s desperate.
Tell me which part I’m going to play, then go on.
But even so, I’ll make doubly sure.
I can’t figure it out by myself!
No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say.
I’m not moving an inch, pal.
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye.
Isn’t that the king?
If any legs here are Trinculo’s, these are. 
Help us, good friends.
You do Stay, Please, tell me what you think of me.
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began.
Ready.
Why, madam, have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king?
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of?
Beautifully, sir, beautifully!
You seem like a good judge.
They’re such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we’re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace.
To work for you, sir.
Take that, and that!
Give me my armor.
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them.
I won’t tolerate him.
I’d rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots.
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable, but I still insist I’ve done everything I could to help you.
Yes, probably, because I’m staying for lunch.
I know the man a bit.
I’ve practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you, but I still couldn’t bear this news like you do.
When I’ve revealed my true identity, you’ll be glad you took the time to help me out.
Damn your mistress!
That’s cowardly and womanish.
Isn’t it past two o'clock?
Is that a good idea, do you think?
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband.
Where is my lovely bride?
Let’s go.
Yes, that was it.
How is Hamlet?
If she feels like coming over here, I’ll give her your message.
Then let’s go in and hear what he has to say—though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word.
This feather moved because of her breath.
After a little while, I’ll beat him too.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Come on, Nerissa, I have many things to do that you don’t even know about yet.
Yes, he does.
You know the law.
Oh, it was a monstrous roar, to make the earth tremble!
Goodbye.
Yours, Claudio, yours, I say.
If you dressed only to stay warm, you wouldn’t need these gorgeous clothes you’re wearing—which don’t keep you warm at all.
Speak once again.
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace.
Thank you kindly, sir.
Until then, God be with you!
Something about Cyprus.
Absolutely—so long as he gets the girl.
So let her execute me.
If you’d known how much that ring meant, how much the woman who gave it to you is worth, or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring, you wouldn’t have let it go.
Ha, ha, ha!
Great God of heaven, say amen to all this!
Tell me, Othello.
If not, what can you do about it?
Hide behind the boxwood hedge, all three of you.
Yes, from top to bottom, sir.
Ah, don’t tear yourself away from me!
Now let me tell you, Casca, I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission.
I hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around. 
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.
Come here, man.
The army is ready.
What do you think he wants?
Why?
You didn’t give me any gold.
Who’s that coming?
Why?
Who does it gallop for?
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love.
Go announce that he will be executed, and tell Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles will be given to him.
It’s a cup, closed in my true love’s hand?
That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen.
Whom did he leave in charge here?
Here, sir, as foolish as ever.
Evil villain!
Won’t you tell me who told you that?
I don’t know why he’s come here.
Oh, do you think we’ll ever meet again?
It’s time that we brought our armies into the field.
He says his name’s Poor Tom.
Do you work in this house?
It is rather cold, indeed, my lord.
I should sit in the corner and sing that song, “Heigh-Ho for a Husband!” Lady Beatrice, I’ll get you a husband.
Disgusting!
I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him.
I’m glad to see your highness.
Signor Antonio, you’ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto.
The more I hate him, the more he follows me around.
We’ll have supper in the morning.
Tell him I’m sick.
Our noblemen are battling bravely.
Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild.
What a painful condition responsibility is.
Well, I disagree.
Don’t do it with poison.
I’m not in the mood.
You may have lost his respect, but so have I.
I don’t remember.
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic.
Allow me to continue.—I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, who, hearing of your daughter’s beauty and wit, her friendly disposition and bashful modesty, her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior, have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I’ve heard is true.
To be brief—as the occasion requires—prepare to fight early in the morning, when your future will be decided.
So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside.
I’m sorry, Malvolio, but this isn’t my writing, though I admit it looks like mine.
We’ll have one heart, one bed, two bodies, and one faithful vow.
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens.
Thrice noble lord, I beg you to excuse me for another night or two—or at least until nightfall.
Your last guess is right.
Yes, my lord, quite well.
See that it is done, and prepare a feast for the soldiers.
Wonderful!
This villain is much quicker than I am.
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too.
Oh, Lord!
No, he did not.
Get away from me, you ass!
Tell her about my son Paris’s love for her.
Please, do so.
He builds our fires, gets our firewood, and does all kinds of useful things for us.—Hey!
He was perfect in everything.
Very pleased to meet you, my lord.
That might be the case sir, 
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully, I will give my answer and acceptance right away.
Well, if you don’t, then I’m out of here.
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home?
Until then, my noble friend, think about this: I’d rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through.
You think I care what I’m called?
Why have you gotten so rude?
Jailer, keep an eye on him.
That was the limit for me.
And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says.
I’d risk my soul for that.
Okay, but when?
Yes, you would beg, if you were in my position.
murder!
Cut off their heads?
Renowned duke, please join us in the abbey, where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us.
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep?
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager.
The king?
The English are in the field, French lords.
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive.
Monday!
Let’s go!
Give me your hand.
Good morning, cousin.
Oh, no, good gentleman!
To find a husband for her sister.
No, but the barber’s assistant has been seen with him.
What does Lord Stanley say?
Saint Francis, help me!
Quiet, everyone!
I’ve seen both of you fence.
What a horrible day!
I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm.
Excellent in fencing, I mean, sir.
Oh, what an excellent young man!
You’ll work for me.
When I opened my eyes, I saw their swords out.
I’m out of breath, sir.
As for this slave, Iago, if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time, he’ll have it.
Who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that?
I won’t listen to you.
If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved.
Yes, but he’d deny it all.
Call to him, Mercutio.
Good night, honest Iago.
It’s just my bad luck.
Here, hang them on this clothesline.
Goodbye, goodbye.
They couldn’t, they wouldn’t.
Good idea.
He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this, and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack.
Should I believe that death is in love with you, and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress?
Order them to escape.
My brother Gloucester’s voice?
We’ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords, then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room.
You call this house dark?
That’s good, Lion!
When things are at their worst they have to stop, or else improve to the way things were before.
Welcome, dear madam.
Can I have some?
He’s giving her a taste of her own medicine.
Here comes the man himself.
Then what’s Antony?
Let him think about his own debt.
True, if a fool such as yourself could find it.
What’s the news?
I can tell you who time strolls for, who it trots for, who it gallops for, and who it stops cold for.
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely.
Let my sorrow have the upper hand.
Lead the way.
Now go, set up for dinner.
Will the moon be shining on the night we’re performing our play?
She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her.
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer.
I’d rather have my horse than a mistress.
What time is it?
This land will belong to your and Albany’s children forever.—And now what does my second daughter Regan, the wife of Cornwall, have to say?
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman.
Out in the world, I’m like a drop of water, trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean.
They certainly do like to butt heads!
So, please, my lord, don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor, with no titles to my name.
Antony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism.
Titinius is lying face-up.
We did, my lord, weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer.
Call them.
Come, why be so hesitant?
Death is my son-in-law.
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before?
You were tricked into fighting, Gloucester.
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio, and then we’ll journey on to see your son, who will rejoice at your arrival.
You wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so.
I’ve heard her say that.
There’s very little about her that’s gloomy, my lord.
Why does it matter that I’m not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited?
Maybe it’s an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes.
Let’s give a fair verdict.
That big ship over there looks no bigger
I hid under this monster’s cloak to get out of the storm.
You can’t party your way into dukedoms there.
of patience.
How did you get better?
Do you want to know the truth?
What work can you do?
I know you’ll say “yes,” and I’ll believe you.
We’ll chase ’em into their latrines.
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her?
What news do you have?
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny.
Shylock is my name.
I did.
Here, Peter Quince.
Then how will we see their own natural tears?
Take off my mistress' gown for your master’s use!
That’s what makes it “sensitive” news.
Why are you leading these men through the streets?
Yes, even power gets in its own way.
So you’re the only one who could play Pyramus.
Open it and read it.
I will.
Please, sir, don’t trouble yourself.
Good morning, Benedick.
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them, they’ll battle each other to the death to have it all.
My father’s spirit is growing in me, and I won’t take this any longer.
What do you need me to do?
Shall I be your slave?
How does she claim to own you?
You’re stripped of your power and your command, and Cassio will govern Cyprus.
Well, sir, it’s better to say little than to be tedious.
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath, and he’s coming to make his choice now.
God forbid!
Oh, it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets, taking their scent with it.
Have some patience, please.
Oh Dardanius!
Or did you agree to this as equals?
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.
Then you’re a fool for being sad that your brother’s soul is in heaven.
When we meet on Judgment Day, that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell, where devils will grab me.
Nothing can be made out of nothing.
Oh dear gods!
And as long as she’s herself—wise, beautiful, and faithful—she’ll always have a place in my heart.
His attendants are desperate, violent men.
Well, that’s really my job.
I’m sweating and trembling with fear.
Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it.
No, great king.
I will.
Let’s listen to him.
She disgusts me, the little hussy!
Tell me, rainbow, do you know if either Venus, the goddess of love, or her son, Cupid, is accompanying Queen Juno?
You liar, you respond better to the whip than to kindness!
Yes, one, and this is how I did it.
Unless I am mistaken, Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa, where we both stayed twenty years ago.
Look at you, thrashing about like a blind man.
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house.
You wanted to be king of the island, sir?
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away.
Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you.
Well, let me get back to my choice.
Doesn’t a Jew have eyes?
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to hurry.
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects.
Yes, if a woman grows up to be a man.
I’m sure he’s been kidnapped.
You want me to say what I’m thinking?
Kiss him for that, good widow.
You, Prince, are the man who can give me justice.
I’ll try talking to him again.
It really is good to see you.
It’s mine, sir.
This is just what the letter said.
That’s the end of the announcement.
Don’t harp on that point, madam—it’s past.
Their forces are nearby.
I know him.
She can’t deny it.
It’s strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger.
Go away, get out of here, and stop following me.
He’s a good-looking young man, and there are a lot of people with him.
Tell me so I can be sure, though I swear I recognize your voice.
There are enemies here.
are you going to let them break me out of jail?
I mean well, sir.
What did you say?
But one word more— He will not be commanded by you.
Happy that we’re not too happy, lucky in being not too lucky.
Give me some ink and paper.
You’re sure full of smooth answers.
Benedick, did you notice Signior Leonato’s daughter?
I am glad he’s coming, however he’s dressed.
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is.
I have to tell you everything.
In a minute, sir.
Sa, sa, sa, sa.
Damn it all to hell!
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors.
Come, sweet Audrey.
Not yet.
Squabbling?
Give me that boy and I’ll come with you.
He’ll find out soon what happened in England.
Cassio’s killed a young Venetian named Roderigo.
Have a good night!
He left behind myself and my twin sister, who was born in the same hour as me.
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind.
Here, I’ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage, which is waiting for us at the gate.
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’ orders in favor of yours.
I have more news too.
Just to the Tower—I’m guessing, for the same reason you are: to salute the noble princes who are staying there.
What do you think?
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough.
Ha, ha!
Ah, all you up in heaven!
No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip.
Light the candles!
Where are they supposed to come?
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave.
I never saw him like this before.
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here.
It means being full of sighs and tears, like I am for Phoebe.
Normally I would ask you what your name is first.
And here’s my mistress, Titania.
Ah, this place is too cold to be hell.
What do you wish?
He died on Viola’s thirteenth birthday.
I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman.
How could I honorably give him what I’ve already given you?
Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight.
Sadness takes away our color.
The Constable of France.
Then why did you travel so quietly?
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn’t find its heart.
Say that it’s my fear that keeps you inside and not your own.
I have to follow him and give him the letter.
I bet it’s a love letter!  
This is  It is, my lord.
Is that the naked guy?
In that case it’s your imagination that’s interesting, not the play.
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body, then good things would fight to live in it.
Oh, a plague has been prevented, thank God!
Dear master, I can’t go any farther.
But where did this happen?
So you’re admitting Clarence, my father, is dead.
Either you, or I, or both of us have to go with him.
Duke of Burgundy, if you want peace, the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe, you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands.
I hope so.
Why would she write to Edmund?
So, the sun won’t shine today!
Farewell, good Salisbury; and may good luck go with you.
them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
No, a whole share for me.
Here comes the messenger with your niece.
Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him!
But who was that man?
I, sir, am Dromio.
By God, it does look like a camel.
Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame, while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the final stamp to his humiliation?
Now, my lord, what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won’t go along with our plans?
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy, my lord.
He’s a raven with the feathers of the dove.
Is it them?
But, hey, this doesn’t mean you’re looking to get married, does it?
And maybe a third?
Let’s go to bed, knight.
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you.
Yes, my lord.
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio.
It has leaked out that you’re hiding here.
Oh, Brutus!
Are you her husband, boy?
Please make him change his mind.
The man’s going crazy.
I wish I had a fault like that!
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter.
Please smile whenever you’re near me, my dearest darling.”
Sure thing, we’ll do it tomorrow morning.
Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy.
No one else would.
In that case, leave our cousin Katherine here with us.
I pardon that man.
What can I do for you?
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us.
No one’s listening to you.
You’re a man?
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease.
Then please tell me he’s all right.
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear.
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain, let’s think about the worst that may happen.
If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet.
Because I’m a Jew.
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax, my mother.
Look, sir, I’m bleeding.
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying, vanity, babbling, drunkenness, or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to.— Oh, my God!
The taming school?
I accept that offer happily, madam.
I’ll give him some liquor.
That can’t be.
Are you going to provoke me?
As long as that?
What if she won’t kiss me?
Go back with her?
Grant their law-abiding request!
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on?
Bloodshed will force you to.
But I just can’t love him.
No one will listen to it.
I’m not one of his sluts.
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you, just consider it a big flirtation, the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth.
No, I had to do something.
As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests.
Sadly, it’s the king that’s missing.
Look, he’s moving.
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.
He’ll release him.
I’ll go call the watch.
Who’s shouting “murder”?
I’d give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him.
This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse.
No lie—she screamed at you.
In that case, I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest, and bestow your daughter on me.
Go.
Along with this strange power, he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities.
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind.
Have a good morning.
She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that.
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him, the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child, and both princes would still be alive, not preyed on by worms.
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you, and I’ll do what he says.
I’m warning you.
Your life is stretched to its limit.
Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him.
Take this mad wretch to jail.—Father-in-law Baptista, will you see that he’s available to appear in court?
According to an agreement, I should wear it myself.
Don’t worry about me.
M”—Malvolio.
How are you, madam?
Yes, Caesar, but it’s not gone yet.
Come, uncle Exeter, enter Harfleur.
They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them.
Do I, sir?
All three of them are crazy with despair.
What part of her body is Ireland?
Oh, dear gods!
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears.
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey.
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears.
Where is our entertainment director?
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail, but I don’t think he brought it to you.
I know that she is worthy of that love.
If we meet again, then we’ll smile.
Hold your peace.
Yes, ma'am.
In any case, do what you want.
My lord, I wish Thursday were tomorrow.
They tell me you’ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he’s doing.
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white, I can scarcely believe it, it’s so past understanding.
The flags have fallen.
It’s yours.
Your wife, sir, your wife.
Whatever your highness commands me to do, it is always my duty to do it.
Romeo!
Lady, did you sleep in her room last night?
I’ll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind.
Enough of this.
Am I really like one of those guys?
You’re a fool.
Who’s that at the gate, uncle?
Get a little sleep.
Why the hell did you come in between us?
Hasn’t he proven himself to be a great villain—slandering, scorning, and dishonoring my cousin?
Cram your good news into my ears.
I definitely will.
Now it’s time to get back to my studying, since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner.
A man named Taurus, they say.
Well, enough about them.—Come here, Catesby.
I think she’s the most wonderful woman I’ve ever laid eyes on.
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you.
My good lords, I plan to.
Tell him that the mayor, some citizens, and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good.
Many thanks, Signior Gremio.
Oh, don’t touch me.
Beware the thane of Fife.
Let’s follow them.
My lord?
Truthfully, my name is Cinna.
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel, and good luck to him then.
Don’t think about her.
How can you square things with me?
When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily.
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard.
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing?
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword.
Hurry.—Oh, love, if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft.
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die.
Let Merriman catch his breath—the poor dog’s foaming at the mouth.
It’s my duty to be quiet.
On top of this, they’ve either burned or carried away everything that was in the king’s tent.
Welcome to Cyprus.
It’s weird.
Put out your torches.
My husband is often like this, and he has been since he was a child.
You have to pretend to be your niece’s father, and give her away to Claudio.
Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam.
Oh, listen to me, night— Who is this?
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood.
It’s better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety.
What’s this!
Don’t disturb his soul.
This is a love token from some other slut, and you want me to copy its pattern for you?
Yes, every inch a king.
I pray that the mighty gods defend you!
Brother, Duke, please have some food.
Bring in more wine!              
Write down that Prince John is a villain.
You just said all your lines at once, cues and all.—Pyramus, enter.
Sir, Octavius has already arrived in Rome.
The first drink makes him a fool, the second makes him crazy, and the third drowns him.
Are we all ready?
If he seems game to our plan, encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons.
No, madam.
Blow the trumpet!
All right, Friar Francis, let’s keep this short.
You should have run up to her, unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot, and rendered the young man speechless.
And so—?
How dare I?
What are you doing?
That’s great.
Has it been decided that Richard will be  It’s been decided, though not yet officially announced.
How strange I’m feeling!
Our forces are ready for them.
No, you have to forget all that now.
Though I have far more reason, I don’t have as much energy to curse you.
O, this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery.
Oh, sir, on her nose, which is covered with pimples, sores, and red welts.
If I could beg others to change their minds, begging would convince me, too.
If she’s lying, I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day.
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried?
Anyway, how are you, Jessica?
If I can bear that pain, then I can bear my husband’s secrets.
Speak, Pyramus.—Thisbe, come forward.
Oh earth, which soaks up this blood, revenge his death!
May the gods bless you.
Advancement to some scaffold, to lose their heads.
Hello, beautiful Helena!
Put him within the reach of my sword, and if he escapes, may heaven forgive him as well!
If it turns out that she really is running around on me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll break my heart.
I’m better off because of my enemies, and worse off because of my friends.
Good night, brother.
Dead.
No.
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world, encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home, where there’s little to be found in the way of experience.
I’ll give  Thank you, darling.
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony.
Me, ma'am?
He’s insane.
I will go find him.
From the earth, or the air?
Are you insane, talking like this?
Please, I’m asking you, go ahead and get back to your state affairs.
Where is he?
He did, very sincerely.
I’ve got something for you.
Besides, they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all, a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death.
I wasn’t expecting you, and I’m not ready to receive you.
Oh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that?
I’m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you.
It’s too late.
I’m done for.
Now Margaret’s curse has fallen on our heads, for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son.
Why, no, boy.
I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife.
But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me.
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of him!
By the moon and stars!
What was that cry for?
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing.
Good luck.
Your name’s Gloucester.
Follow me, madam.—Throw the blind traitor outside.
Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor.
I’m not drunk.
He’s in his chambers now, and he’s extremely upset.
I’ll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that.
Oh God, I have a soul that predicts evil things!
It fell on a little western flower, which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love.
You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well.
Who would do that?
If we’d been able to put on our play, we would have had it made.
He’s really taken this prank to heart.
I’m headed for your niece, sir.
It wouldn’t let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body.
I know you’ll offer nothing less than that.
Yes.
I am tired.
I’m as good a gentleman as the emperor.
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt.
It’s nice of you to remind me.
Call him!
But as of right this second all these things are yours.
I think you’re all either bewildered or stark raving mad.
What’s there to say?
Why did he do that?
Tell me!
I’ll reward you for your troubles.
The only possibility is that you’ve murdered him.
Actually, I should.
Show.
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight.
You’re leaving with my tongue in your tail?
It looks great.
What happened, general?
Strike!
Excellent.
If I tremble then, you can call me a little girl.
How old are you, friend?
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?
Then turn your noble face away from me, that face that the whole world adores.
Will you abandon her?
How are you, Lorenzo?
I mean, is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful?
They only like things as bad as themselves.
In fact, the real nightmare had only just begun.
Do you want to know what I wrote?
When we’re faced with a wretched person, bruised and crying with hardship, we try to get them to shush up.
It is.
I wish there was less social pressure to drink.
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will.
I won’t mess with him.
How did he say good-bye?
They were poisoned, then.
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered—what more am I supposed to do?
Would you like some more sauce to go with it?
Tut, tut, my lord, we’re not going to stand around chit-chatting.
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again.
But Count Claudio can stay, for what I’m about to say concerns him.
You should be whipping yourself, since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you’re punishing her.
No, come back, Kate.
To race after your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as great as the resulting loss.
We’re very sorry, sir, that you may not live to wear us out with your commands.
The ground feels flat to me.
Now, on my life, the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes, whom she adores.
Small but brave in his surroundings, he’s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth.
Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off.
Oh, my mistress, a villain has made a mockery of your love!
I’m happy about that.
There’s nothing to fear in him.
The armies have merely changed places, Titinius, because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus’s forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius’s legions.
I didn’t order it.
If you aren’t immortal, watch those around you.
Well, you know, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.” Anyway, I was part of the trick, sir.
Why aren’t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up?
Why are you talking like this?
Caesar’s better qualities exist in Brutus, and we will crown him.
You are Antonio, you are he.
I know who you are.
Though I expect she’ll wear me out more quickly than I’ll wear out what I’m wearing—which will be good for her and even better for me!
Once he’s carried our treasure where we want it, we’ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass, to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures.
We are all made of dreams, and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death.
Dear man, calm your rage.
Stay calm.
Ill will never prompted anything well said.
Come sit on me.
Maybe you think that I think you’re in love.
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth.
Come on, music!
When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only weapon.
Agree to swear.
Why are you doing this?
Come, sir, no more.—Oswald, come here!
No.
Me, “greedy”!
It’s Casca—I know your voice.
Now this is where you come in.
In just an hour from now, Duchess of York, I’ll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens.
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about?
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now.—Say goodbye to them, Cordelia, even though they’ve been unkind to you.
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.” That’s like saying, “Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying ‘thank you.’” If this doesn’t move me to take pity on her, I’m a horrible person.
I don’t wish that on you.
That’s for sure.
I saw Bassanio sail away, and Gratiano went with him.
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes.
If my heart’s dear love— Well, don’t swear.
Will you come with me to hear this news, sir?
What a stupid man he’s become!
I hope this play is well cast now.
I’d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night.
It’s “never get tired.” Oh!
Antonio’s a good man.
The ground is brown.
I’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden.
I hope for my brother’s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor.
He would have?
Then the window lets day in, and life goes out the window.
Oh, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, for a whole hour now.
It hangs like an old worn-out mop.
I have an aunt who is a widow, who’s very rich and doesn’t have any children.
Oh, I really think she loves me!
Is that the man you want?
And in public too.
It’s still waving to me.
Here’s to you, Menas.
The wound can’t be that bad.
I don’t feel like going.
And as for his dreams, I’m surprised he’s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night.
Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days.
You lie.
No, he refused it publicly, in open court.
He has, my lord.
You can have it then, your highness.
What’s more, people at the 
Tell me right now and stop fooling: where’s the money?
And, being a man of your breeding, you’re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar?
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones!
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude, inadequate writing, keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history’s full glory with his uneven telling.
What, Gertrude?
Who’s that calling so loud?
I’m starting to feel murderous urges.
There’s no crab-apple here, so don’t look sour.
I’ll stop by before you go to bed, and tell you what I’ve heard.
Yes, at Philippi.
Roderigo’s been killed?
My God, it’s morning.
Only until noon, my lord?
You will love more than you are loved.
Who are the actors?
So I welcome this wind freely.
The fight is between our masters, and we men who work for them.
I’m always happy to hear about brave men.
Neither would I.
What’s the obvious conclusion from that?
Step aside.
Believe me, my friend, since I have the power to stop the prosecutors.
Past noon.
My lord, here is the entrance.
No braver than this?
But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark.
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this.
What’s the reason for this horrible shouting?
Just think, I could be Count Malvolio!      
Yes, my good lord.
We’ll keep the lines of communication open between us.
And where’s Cordelia?— Do you see this, Kent?
Give him my respects, and tell him I’ll definitely be there for dinner, since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal.
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret, the Lady Hero’s waiting woman, tonight.
Time travels at different speeds for different people.
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun.
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep.
Are you coming monster?
Father, wife, friends—farewell!
As sure as I’m standing here, I saw him.
To get my poor, mad husband out from inside there.
Please listen to me carefully.
If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t recognize him.
I wasn’t talking to any man at that time, my lord.
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness.
Don’t move, dog.
Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that love.
Why do you hide these things?
I swear, he’ll be food for the crows soon.
It’s yours, and you may hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like.
What do you think of these quick-witted folks, Gremio?
I, sir, am Dromio.
Think like this all day, and you’ll learn how to curse.
Bad news, my lord.
Why should he have followed you?
Come, Ariel—I summon you with a thought.
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly.
You’ve stolen both my job and my name!
Let’s get away, Tybalt.
I haven’t done anything wrong.
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless.
We’ll draw straws.
I am sorry for her, as I should be, since I am both her uncle and her guardian.
It doesn’t need to be witty as long as it’s eloquent and imaginative.
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms.
Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet. 
No, no, no, no!
Ungodly and monstrous!
When you free your children from the sword, your grandchildren will repay you in your old age.
She speaks daggers, and every word stabs.
A spirit?
Our arms, which can be strong and cruel, and our hearts, filled with brotherly love, embrace you with kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
Suffolk died first, and York, cut to pieces, came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face, kissing his gashes.
I’ll look over the inscriptions again.
He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back.
My soul and not my child!
Prove you are worthy of your birth, which I do not doubt for a moment.
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions.
I’m locked in one of them.
Are you ill?
Sorry, I’m all stuffed.
I’m bleeding, but you didn’t kill me.
I’ll be nice to him.
I need to speak a word with you.
Come on, my lord.
Look, your wife is with him.
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo!
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter.
I was never disloyal, and I never will be.
Come, bring me to them.
I am not made of stone; I am affected by all these kind pleas, though it goes against my conscience and my soul.
It doesn’t matter.
You’ll beat me?
Come on in, con man.
I’ll use it for fish bait.
Are you this impatient?
Has the storm passed?
My husband lost his life to get the crown, and my sons' fortunes have been tossed up and down, leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses.
Come on, you keep getting paler.
You’ll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper; he’ll be a guest of your new master.
will damage your reputation with them—and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre.
No, you can’t do that until you take her hand and, in front of this friar, swear to marry her.
And to hell with drowning yourself!
Be quiet and listen to me.
What mercy can you show him, Antonio?
She’s not even fourteen years old.
I’m about to fly away.
But do you mean what you’re saying?
Because then I’d have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood.
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable?
Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it.
And you, good farmers, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the vigor of your upbringing.
What, from myself?
Why, last night.
An Englishman?
Madam, you’ve given me life and given me a living too.
Hortensio 
Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse.                
Who did it?
Thank you, Tubal.
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking.
Look how your servants wait on you, each one ready to do whatever you command.
I believe you are, Regan.
Didn’t you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season?
The king is coming here tonight.
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me, and then killed herself.
When I could see, I didn’t always see clearly.
Please, give me that goblet, if you love me.
I’ll have my lessons in the order and manner 
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself.
Knock, knock!
Where would Othello go?—Oh, look at you!
We’re done for!
Banquo!
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise.
We’ll be ready when the time comes.
I saved his life and gave him my love, without reservation.
One of them contains my picture.
I sent the king’s son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island, where he’s sitting now sighing, with his arms crossed like this.
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you, Antony, were Caesar’s son, you would be satisfied with them.
Write to me very soon and I’ll let you know what she thinks.
But in loving me, you would love the friend of France, for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it.
Run after that obnoxious messenger, the duke’s servant.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern.
Good day, Catesby.
Order him to advance his forces first thing, and we’ll follow.
Mistress, both the man and his master are possessed.
Sir, fifteen days of March have gone by.
I didn’t see them.
Good madam, let me speak.
Their messengers are ready, waiting to deliver our response in these matters.
If you act like my daughter, I’ll marry you to my friend.
The fire is ready.
Such a wonderful father-in-law and wife make this place a paradise.
Oh God!
Is it on record that he built it, or is it just word of mouth?
Stay invisible.
But what did you want?
What?
How is your Highness?
Go find the traitor Gloucester.
I’m amazed you’re still talking, Signior Benedick.
Halt!
Yes, we should get his support, for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions.
I feel this pinprick.
For you, our swords have blunt edges, too dull to harm you, Mark Antony.
Do I look as pale as everyone else does, Lord Dorset?
If it pleases you, your highness, why don’t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company?
Why do you look like a frightened goose?
But I don’t hate Orlando.
I beg your pardon.
I say he shall go to prison.
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes.
No?
Lady Beatrice, have you been crying this entire time?
Be quiet and depart.
Are you going?
You mean “paragon.” A  The duke’s leaving the temple.
He’s staying in the forest with your father now.
But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony.
There’s still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn’t been washed off yet.
This is rebellion.
As the sonnet says, “If you please one special person, you please everyone who matters.” Why, what’s going on?
Be calm, dear lady.
He’s near death, and Roderigo’s dead already.
Come, driver!
My lord, my life is as important to me as yours is to you, and it was never as precious to me as it is now.
In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside.
Master, do you really mean that?
What’s the matter, dear?
I’ll go and coach them.
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries.
I did.
My brother’s servants used to be my equals.
There isn’t a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome.
I’m biting my thumb.
Go on, my loving lord.
I’ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens.
Do you really think so?
I’m telling the truth.
Do what he says, William.
Happy indeed, the way we have spent the day.
You worthless girl!
Oh, no.
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.
According to the laws of war, you didn’t have to fight a stranger.
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him.
Still, Edmund was beloved.
The  It’s too bad there’s more of the Moor than there ought to be.
Why, what’s the matter?
Or is he on his horse?
Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song.
I second that 
I’d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports, piers, and waterways.
I didn’t think I would see you here.
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion?
That “may be” must be, love, on Thursday.
Who brought it out here?
For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony.
If I had known this young man was his son, I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight.
Good-bye.
If she orders me to go, I’ll thank her warmly as if she’d just offered to put me up for a week.
But love gives them power, and time gives them the chance to meet, sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure.
I’m very uncomfortable, and that won’t help my case.
Good heavens!
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease.
Why, what have you done, sweet Beatrice?
Instead of crying, let’s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men.
What’s the news?
We’re in.
Sir, that’s well said and well thought out.
This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was once considered an honest man.
Why do you pity him?
I’m not sure, but I don’t think so.
I’m going to get my  Please, listen to me.
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king.
I swear to God I won’t.
I’m just sorry I had to be the one to kill him.
Give my regards to your daughter.
Therefore, you should obey their wishes.
My wife was killed too?
And after that he came back here looking so serious?
It’s absurd.
What does that mean, sir?
Who’s this Adam you speak of?
Make a bug show of mourning for her, hang sad epitaphs up at your family’s tomb, and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies.
I’m being called.
It’s not a false gallop, anyway.
I’ll make Oliver find him.
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt.
Now, as you’re a Roman, tell me the truth.
Give me your hand.
Well, take him on up and we’ll try to pull it off.
Should be?
I won’t fight you.
Your threats are no stronger than her whining.—Helena, I love you.
I’m afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith.
He can sniff his way to Dover.
He was graced with lots of natural gifts, he was young, valiant, wise, and no doubt meant to be king.
Then the Jew must show you mercy.
If you take more or less than exactly a pound, even if it’s just the tiniest fraction of an ounce—if the scale changes by even so much as a hair, you die, and all your property will be confiscated.
I’ll go join him there, going down deeper than any anchor ever sank, and lie with him dead in the mud.
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester, follow Fluellen at a close distance.
You expect me to cry?
Indeed, I should have asked you before who he was.
Are you hurt, lieutenant?
We’ll both be safer if we go separate ways.
It’s been proven that Lady Hero is innocent, that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived, and that Don John—who has run away—is the source of all the trouble.
If he struggles, use force!
Here he is.
I don’t know.
Reading their mail isn’t as bad.
I’m sure you know him.
Monstrous!
I haven’t eaten today.
A backbiting friend, one who grabs people, who patrols the streets and passageways.
Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.
Where is she?
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair?
Oh noble lord, consider your lineage.
James Tyrrel—and your most obedient subject.
Go, daughter.
If she is, you can sue me for lying to you.
You know why I think so?
I know this quality in you, Brutus—it’s as familiar to me as your face.
Where is my page?
One of you go call the Jew into court here.
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy’s Day.
Take your time.
I can only do it by lying, my lord, but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me.
Why did you once seem lovely to me?
Good husband, come home soon.
Then she is well, and nothing is wrong.
Give me your hand.
I think it’s later than that, sir.
What’s his name?
The king will already have left Southampton.
I don’t see any blood.
These are tricks.
Why, good sir?
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona, except purgatory, torture, and hell itself.
No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in.
Or tell me, my sweet love, what you’d like to eat.
You know how young my daughter is.
I didn’t tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another.
Give me the daggers.
He’s already done so.
Good food’s not a big deal—everyone can afford that.
I don’t like it.
Oh, chest, obey me!
I think it was at sea.
Well, that’s just greedy.
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started.
Morning’s here.
Nurse!
Up.
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.
Damn it, shut your mouth.
I look forward to that present.
They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food.
Fight it like a man.
A bit of a hurry, my lord!
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this?
Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers.
Why, you scoundrel!
Well, if it wasn’t her, I don’t know.
What did you think about that French lord, Monsieur le Bon?
For various reasons that must remain secret, please do this for me.
Maria!
Are you going to get me in trouble?
It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it.
Nearest his heart.”—Those are the very words.
Where are you, keeper?
When the time comes, tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I’ll return.
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners.
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful.
The gods forbid!
Just as you got Milan, I’ll get Naples.
Go to bed, and sleep.
Hortensio and I have given you up.
And as for my soul, how can the ghost endanger that, since it’s as immortal as the ghost is?
And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once.
There is a crab-apple here.
I can’t wait to meet her!
Never.
Have a seat.
I was born in Pisa, famous for its serious citizens, like my father before me; my father, Vincentio, a successful, world-traveled merchant, was one of the 
No, not like before.
Why are you calling me “love”?
Of course.
I wouldn’t either, by daylight.
Of brave earls, Grandpré and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix, Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.
My words would bounce her to my sweet love, and his words would bounce her back to me.
It’s Richard who sent us here to slaughter you.
God save your Majesty.
He’s so flighty in his old age, as we keep noticing.
If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed?
What’s this?
Well then, add some interjections that indicate laughter, like  Hold on, Friar.
Have I lost my wit?
Another case: King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France.
It’s not daylight.
Where is he?
Come on.
You’re making me go off-key.
Now, my sweet lord, you know how much I like you.
A guy like that is bigger than an ape, but the ape could be his doctor, it’s so much smarter.
Come back to my house with me.
Get up, liar.
Yes, just as great and just as recent.
The weather is fair.
Give my compliments to your lady.
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you.
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners?
Me too, lieutenant.
How are you, my royal lord?
But since you’re his scoundrel servant, I will.
What do you want to tell me?
Don’t tell me that.
Once, on a cold and windy day, when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks, Caesar said to me, “Cassius, I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there.” As soon as he spoke, though I was fully dressed, I plunged in and called for him to follow.
It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested.
Now I go, a jolly, thriving wooer, to marry my brother Edward’s young daughter, Elizabeth, because I know Richmond has his eye on her.
My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right away.
Are you thinking of buying her?
You weren’t good enough for her.
Oh, I see.
Now he lies there worth nothing, and no one is so humble as to show him respect.
Your statue spouting blood through many holes, in which many smiling Romans bathed, means that you’ll provide great Rome with sustaining blood, and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood.
I have time for you now, my sad daughter.
Has any man seen him at the barber’s?
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame, so I’m not going to say any more about my boys until I’ve gouged your eyes out with my bare hands.
Good, I’m satisfied.
I did.
No, I don’t.
I’ve sent twenty people to look for you.
I have sent for the strawberries.
How are you feeling now?
My meaning  And I 
Please, dear, come here.
A million goodbyes to you.
Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it.
I just beg death to wait awhile, until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips.
Signor Lodovico?
How handsome it is.
Now, my friendly servant, thank you.
With my eye sockets?
Why should we do this?
A messenger has arrived from Caesar.
If I said something, she’d mock me so mercilessly that I’d probably disintegrate into air.
He only lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one, he died.
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it.
Don’t deceive me.
If you complain any more, I’ll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you’ve howled for twelve years.
Oh my, what’s the news?
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan.
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves, or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men?
We’re not saying anything treasonous, man.
Well, sir, the gown is not for me.
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her!
Listen, because Tybalt was just killed, people might think that we don’t care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party.
Sir, my king, don’t waste your time mulling over how strange this business is.
What sickness did she die of?
How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus.
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean, turning the salty green water to gold.
Are you going to join them?
It’s pretty.
As for your husband, he is noble, wise, and judicious, and he understands what the times require.
Tybalt is lying over there.  
She cheated on me, and she was a whore.
Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you.
By this leek, I swear I’ll make you pay for this.
Hurry up, I say.
The police are here.
Come on, sir.
Go away.
What, you mean my face looks like a crab-apple?
No, no, I’m as ugly as a bear, since animals that see me run away in terror.
Anything that’s mended is only patched up.
Sir Thomas Erpingham.
What’s going on here, you secret, evil, midnight hags?
So please, most gracious duke, order her to bring him out so we can get him some help.
Can we do that?
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that—not to follow their bad example, but to avoid it!
I’ll take it over to the pile.
Well, but what time is it?
It has come again.
There’s meaning in your snoring.
Would you like to taste the banquet?
When he woke, he wouldn’t know where he was.
Maybe she’s just pretending.
Stay here, Titinius.
I will choose this one and try my chances.
We can’t go on with this plan.
If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you.
The brave experience death only once.
My dear lord, you know how passionately stubborn the duke is.
Come to think of it, I thought I felt a scab there.
What can you see out on the ocean?
Speak to us.
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings.
It won’t matter.
I don’t think any woman like that exists.
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules.
Come, find the conspirators!
When she put it on my finger, she made me swear never to sell it, give it away, or lose it.
Why are you making them work so hard?
My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink.
I’m going to cry.
Stars, my lord.
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
Tell me, don’t you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina?
Yes, it’s William, sir.
I do, in fact.
But don’t keep wondering without more proof.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of.
I knew Temperance—she was a fine girl.
I know where she is and, if you don’t mind, I will set her before you tomorrow, whole and unharmed.
Let me ask you a particular question.
I’ll do my best to make this lady love you.
Too late is more like it.
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders.
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money?
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun.
Look: Benedick is so pale—are you sick, or angry?
If not, then I’m a liar.
When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him.
Who are you talking about, niece?
Hmm, let me see:
I’m tired of this moon.
The gates of mercy will be closed by then, and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers, who have tasted blood, will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want, mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants.
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.
The original story was written in the finest Italian.
It is not nighttime now.
Who wouldn’t cheat on her husband to make him king?
Thanks for letting me go.
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her, kinsman, and that’s good English.
But goodbye.
And when she left just now, she said “Take care of this poor fellow here.” Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” not anything referring to my low station in life, but “fellow.” Everything’s going perfectly.
This is pure insanity.
Yes, return and tell me if your master looks well, because he was sick when he left.
I’m here, here!
You’ve made him so delusional he’ll go crazy when he learns the truth.
I’m very glad I came to see you.
What things, my lord?
By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today.
Here I lie and will never get up again.
To whom?
I want to speak with Clarence, and I came here on my legs.
Please come with me.
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days.
Don’t deny to him that you love me.
If you want to make me happy, don’t wish yourself harm.
Just notice.
He’s killed his wife!
I need to get Othello’s things from the ship.
Where are you hiding?
Do you want to go see him?
That young man who was just here.
The gods are fair, and they use our little vices to punish us.
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool?
Here’s the water, right?
Please, my lord, call her back.
You stupid fool!
Who is this bloody man?
The death of my father, my physical weakness, the loss of all my friends, the threats of this man who’s taken me prisoner—all that would be easy for me to take, if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl.
I’m very sorry I was so hard on him.
I asked you again, and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently.
I could not forget you, since I never saw you before in my life.
Sad, my lady!
Fabian can hardly control him over there.
Did the brothers-in-law leave?
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet. 
What’s her skin like?
Oh, sirs, if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I would offend Brutus and Cassius, who, you all know, are honorable men.
Francis Flute, the bellows-repairman?
If you make the accusation convincingly, then my cunning won’t fail me.
You’re now within a foot of the cliff’s edge.
But things have changed there, and it’s easier for them on the road now.
What will this do?
On Thursday, sir?
I find you quite gentle.
She’s the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before.
Only to watch that title become worthless, as her mother has.
No, of course you don’t.
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere!
I saw her buried in her family’s tomb, and then I came here to tell you the news.
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably.
Their lips, like four red roses on a stalk, touched.
I’ll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf.
And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to.
Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer.
I will too.
He talks nothing but nonsense.
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
My boy, it’s true.
Keep a little bit of honesty, even if you’re afraid.
With all of them at once: they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix.
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife.
This haunting business is even stranger than murder.
Be quiet!  
I meant to say the Lord Protector.
You can see how it is all around.
Should we do that?
But I’ll linger.
Am I on earth, in heaven, or in hell?
No, some of it is about my child’s father.
There I’ll see only myself.
No, not at all.
Escape and make peace with Caesar.
Yes, that one.
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath, where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city.
What’s that good for?
I’ll never see my gold again.
Go away.
I’m sorry, sir, but in this war I consider you a subordinate, not my equal.
Who should begin?
Please tell me, who is this man?
Is this really happening?
Wife!
What you just said may perhaps be true.
Here, Peter Quince.
There must be some resolution.
There will be no lecture.
That’s the one.
I’ll make her come right away, I promise you.
Wait, don’t rush!
Come, Romeo.
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father?
Please, sir, be kind to me and tell me.
I’ve finished it for you, and it ends in “Margaret.” He’s turned your curse against you, Margaret.
Until recently, I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean.
They are, my lord.
As wicked as I am, they were slaughtered because of me, not because of anything they did.
Write to him immediately.
That’s what I thought too, sir.
He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet.
But I’m not dying yet!
So how short am I, you painted barber pole?
Call the messenger in.
Clever lies.
Are you out of your mind and deaf too?
Are you Sebastian?
Lean forward.
Great happiness!
Will you come with us?
What!
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria?
Do you see?
What are you doing here?
Are you really alive, Stephano?
I’m sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
The actors are here.
Why did you send me out, brave Cassius?
Good-bye, my lord.
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors, where their bones are kept safe.
I’ll tell you what, Prince: a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn’t change my mood today.
My son will win.
What villain, madam?
The other voice is harsh and abusive.
No, he’s not.
I’ll marry the earl of Warwick’s youngest daughter, Lady Anne.
Good old knight, gather them all together at my tent.
You are a rude, ragged nurse and an old, sullen playmate for such tender princes.
A lot of words.
The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you.
May you choke on any other sentiments like that!
His horse is better than the Neapolitan’s and he frowns more than the Count Palatine.
There’s plenty of time.
God save the king!
I’ll leave you, lady.
Let it be who it is.
Eros, send his treasure to him.
He didn’t say anything, he’s reading.
No, please, I beg your Majesty.
Don’t talk about Helena.
I don’t even know him.
Well, he’s alive.
He’s waiting outside.
If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our bodily urges would take over.
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster.
Yes, of course.
It’s true, my lord.
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused.
In what chapter and verse of his heart?
Well, let’s get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish.
Whether your mouth is black or white, Do-dee, dee-dee da.
Could my good brother-in-law—a man to whom the
What’s that paper you were reading?
The games are done and Caesar is returning.
Curse my very heart, but I think you should be happy in this second marriage, because it’s better than your first.
So much for Fortinbras.
Good-bye.
I can’t find anyone who saw her leave.
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we’ve been asked to convey?
Am I to be dictated to, like a child?
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor.
Start without me.
He doesn’t long for the dawn as we do.
I want to use this money to set my father free.
We’ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers.
I’m wounded.
Hey!
Your highness, I want nothing more than what you’ve already offered.
You should’ve saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself.
My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them.
She’s talking, but she’s not saying anything.
I’ll do that.
Just listen a little more, and I’ll bring you up to date about the present situation, which is the whole reason I’m telling you this story in the first place.
My husband!
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time?
Also, you’re supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who’s drunk to go home and go to bed.
No flattery for him, no sir!
Anyway, my conscience says, “Stay put.” “Go,” the devil says.
That really would be kind.
Well then, leave them alone until they’re sober.
No, not tonight.
Yes, my lord.
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is, to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity.
Do they seem religious?
No, absolutely not.
No, sir, not at all.
There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood.
Think about that, and about what followed afterward.
Do you want to know who they are, then?
Has he taken care of the music?
He’s quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens.
To hell with all worn-out horses, all crazy masters, and all bad roads.
But goodbye.
I’ll put it on anyway.
Is he still alive, good uncle?
So think carefully about what you want, beautiful Hermia.
You go down toward the Capitol, and I’ll go this way.
Damn it!
Speak.
Yes, my good lord.
Ha!
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes!
While he and I are at one, my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other, so nothing will happen that we won’t find out about.
And if I were king of it, you know what I’d do?
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this, then.
When I said that, I was angry too.
If I were in England now, like I was once, and I had even a painted picture of this fish, every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it.
If you say it isn’t true, I’ll give you a province and make you rich.
Help me, angels!
I’ll do all that.
Listen to me, Beatrice— Talking with a man outside her bedroom window!
Forever and forever, farewell, Brutus!
I ask too much of you, but you’re always willing.
What does a crocodile look like?
Lady, come out of the tomb.
Too fast is as bad as too slow.
Please, come with me.
A leathermaker will last nine years.
Has he asked for me?
Don’t let her say I kept you.
I don’t know, ma'am.
You’re bothering me.
Welcome.
But if you have the stomach for it, you’ll have all the help from me you need.
Please, I beg you, don’t scold me.
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph.
Where is your army, then, to beat him back?
One more thing, good gentlemen.
Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
For the sake of our old friendship, I ask you, hold my sword handle while I run on it.
Do you want to get married, fool?
What’s important is the urgency of this mission.
Antonio, I married a woman as dear to me as life itself.
It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk.
This makes me feel so much better!
Yes, I do.
I don’t believe it.
That’s right, or drinking, swearing, fist-fighting, visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing.
Was a man ever so tired?
Yes, very well.
I had a dream last night.
Do you like pictures?
Be kind and polite to this gentleman.
Why, he won’t wake up till Judgment Day.
He’s been gone for nine years and he’s leaving again soon.
Will you, Strato?
But maybe you don’t like mine, or his, or hers either.
I don’t know, except they are busy with some phony guarantee.
children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country.
But, unfortunately, Caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him.
The heavens are being stingy with their light.
You’ll have to woo Bianca like the rest.
No, Octavius Caesar, we’ll respond to their charge.
God help me!
Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them.
What, you mean kid actors?
I don’t know why I should be afraid, since I haven’t done anything wrong.
First of all, even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown—if it were truly my birthright—I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it.
Do you bring me a letter from the friar?
What an awful day!
Leave me and do what I told you to do.
And there’s no need for wonder or worry.
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over.
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
Well, then, there!
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike.
While we were here guarding you as you slept, we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls, or lions.
Where’s the jury, the judge, the lawful proceedings, the verdict?
What, you dare put your hands on me, villain?
It’s a bet.
When Caesar was alive, even he wouldn’t dare anger me like this.
Now, before God, our whole city owes this friar a great debt.
God has blessed you with a good name.
And welcome, welcome!
Not tonight—today.
How tragic!
So get ready to cut off the flesh.
I’ll tell everyone what you did, even if it
Set it down awhile.
Oh, will you leave me alone in the dark?
Or walk either.
What are you talking about?
The gods do this to test my bravery.
My dagger, little nephew?
What, I’m a prisoner?
Didn’t you send Lysander, as an insult, to follow me around praising my eyes and my face?
Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore.
If there’s anyone in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his.
He was in a good mood, and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome.
But never mind.
But if I really laid him bare, I’d have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking.
That’s not what I wish.
What “passion”?
I’ve written to my sister telling her everything he’s said.
Then we’ll call this the Battle of Agincourt, fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
We should definitely say something to the Moor.
Maybe you’ll see some little trinket you want to buy.
Madam, I heard her speak.
Yes, and be wise.
I wish you all the best.
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak.
Watch his reaction.
I need proof!
Taste your legs, sir.
I’d rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it’s dark.
I’m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters.
So get out of here!
Oh,  Master, master, look!
I’ve spelled it out for you clearly.
Shall we go watch this wrestling, cousin?
Really?
Get busy, go!
Most noble Antony!” Then, as she was speaking your name, a strangled groan split her words.
Why are you hiding that letter?
It’s always better to get rid of what you’re scared of than to be afraid.
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy, and may God bless you.  
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost.
That’s comforting.
I wish I could live longer.
I’ll read it aloud.
He’s waiting nearby to find out if you’ll invite him in.
Here, my good lord.
What do you mean, “wears the wreath”?
But go on.
And death, not Romeo, can take my virginity!
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek.
Not me.
Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried.
Death is my heir.
It sounds more like you’re insulting me.
I order you to come with me.
Carry them away.
What is the matter?
He sleeps all day like a cat.
As for the rest of the ships, I scattered them, and they’ve gathered again in the Mediterranean, sailing sadly home to Naples, believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king.
My lord, you know I’m your friend.
I will, my lord.
She already has a face.
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of, yes or no?
Goodbye!
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency, and even pretended he didn’t know him.
Oh, you evil woman!
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight.
When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am.
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours?
My money’s almost run out.
Captain Macmorris, when we have more leisure, see, I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare, and that’s that.
This is the time of night when witches come out, when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out.
Her bridegroom is here.
We grew together like twin cherries—which seemed to be separate but were also together—two lovely cherries on one stem. 
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair, I hope he gives you a beard!
I did.
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty.
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me.
Well, good night.
Tell me, please: how many boys and girls will I have?
They 
So I recommend you take note of what I’m about to say.
Well, then, I hope he chokes on it!
But not so nice when women misbehave.
Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?
Oh, I don’t know.
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I’m old and I’ll die soon.
Let’s meet as little as we can.
We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly.
I can’t blame you, old lord.
And you haven’t heard any news about her in your letters?
She’ll die for it.—Eros, ho!
Back then, I called you “a poor, imitation queen,” a badly reproduced copy of what I was, a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow, a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell, a mother only teased with two beautiful children, who would soon die.
I was born to speak cleverly, not seriously.
Ask your husband if you doubt me.
Chat her up, Sir Andrew.
Go, then, mother, to your daughter.
Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation.
Also, he’s left you all his walkways—in his private gardens and newly planted orchards—on this side of the Tiber River.
We’ll do our duty to you, sir.
Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead!
I know the king and queen sent for you.
I’ll stand guard with you tonight.
But he’s sleeping.
Richard, the duke of Gloucester, hates you.
Time has come round, and I’ll end where I began.
What do you say to a calf’s foot?
There’d be no marriage?
They still haven’t joined the battle.
It’s pointless to talk now.
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof.
Trinculo, speak politely.
I don’t deny it.
Young Prince Edward is still alive—what do you think I’m going to say next?
What?
We’ll burn Brutus’s house.
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep.
Yes, the state’s half can be reduced, but not Antonio’s.
Who’s there?
Charmian, did I ever love Caesar as much as this?
Oh yes—to smell  This is Signor Antonio.  
I’m glad to see you.
He brings great news.
Wherever we go, men will smile at us while hiding daggers.
Here.
Let’s lay everything upon the king: our lives, our souls, our debts, our anxious wives, our children, and our sins.” I must bear responsibility for all of it.
Let it be.
For my part, I really don’t care.
The man in the moon!
Are you sure we’re awake?
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed, for my horse is my mistress.
Bow to him, fairies, and curtsy to him.
Come, come away.
No, let’s not swear an oath.
Come, sisters, let’s cheer him up and show him our talents.
Listen, listen to what I say: whoever strikes first, I’ll run him through with my sword, as sure as I’m a soldier.
He likes me, and I’ve given him good reason to.
Down with the Capulets!
Why did you do that?
We have to strike while the iron’s hot.
Let this anger sharpen your sword.
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets, mocking us.
I remember.
fast and pray to stave off temptations.
Where’s your conscience now?
No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first.
But wait a minute!
Sir, what is your opinion of me?
Call him over here, good Monsieur Le Beau.
No, my lord.
All these quarrels are about me.
Take  Beatrice, have you come because I called for you?
Who do you think you are coming in here armed?
You can stand in his place.
You’re a lying, cowardly wretch.
Let quick sulfurous lightning, strong enough to split enormous trees, singe the white hair on my head.
I didn’t refuse you.
Will you help me?—What an ass and a fool, a gullible no-good idiot!
Officers, take them away.
Me too, my lord.
And now she’ll start moaning, of course— Are you asleep, my love?
If you are human, don’t stand for it.
Is his ship sturdy?
Then Antony offered it to him again, and he refused it again (though, in my opinion, he was reluctant to take his hand off it).
Good friends, I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient, sweet, virtuous wife.
I’m almost ready to break down hearing this much.
Innocent sweethearts, you have no idea who’s responsible for your father’s death.
Come here, Catesby.
Why, so did you.
Yes, my lord.
Now go find the forest ranger.
His counselors will govern as long as he’s a minor, and then he’ll take over.
My strength is all gone, as if in a dream.
What, you’re not a whore?
Say the last word I spoke was “Antony,” and please word it pathetically.
I wish they’d fight in fire or in the air.
Lead those away who will follow you, and we’ll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar’s death.
No, if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell.
Who does he accuse?
I’ll do most of the drinking for you.
You didn’t offend us, you offended the king.
Don’t speak of this again.
We will watch the execution.
When the day comes, I’ll wish it were nighttime, so I could sleep with the legal expert’s clerk.
And what about him, Tranio?
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up.
As king, I cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour.
A man of great influence.
No, go ahead and take my life.
Excuse me, weren’t you with Countess Olivia just now?
Lysander, where are you going with all this?    
The king has just honored me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people.
Both of which, master constable— You have.
Let’s not fight over this fellow.
Don’t leave me in the lurch.
Drown yourself?
Old age always makes people act funny—even wise people, but fools more than anybody.
I think you’re more articulate.
I recognize the handwriting.
He is coming.
Okay, let’s go!
Drowned?
So, I agree with noble Buckingham—only a few should go to meet the prince.
Ride, ride, Messala.
Isn’t there any other rite you can perform?
I wish you could face your bad news like a man!
No, not until Thursday.
Once I’m there, I won’t need a guide anymore.
My noble lord— What is it, Iago?
Lord Edmund didn’t speak to your master at home?
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon?
I hope with all my heart she will!
Look how far that little candle sends its light!
Humble greetings, great master!
They stared at us in confusion.
Think about it.
I see.
I would, if I had a mirror.
Oh, sweet England!
You must go to Parthia.
You’re tigers, not daughters.
They will steal anything and call it spoils.
That’s why I wish my sister didn’t have a name, sir.
Father is on the lookout.
Didn’t you hear someone shouting?
I will.
Your wife, Fulvia, mustered her army first.
I wish I were senseless, sir, so that I wouldn’t feel your punches!
So let’s join forces and get revenge.
This fellow will out-talk us all.
I don’t feel guilty about them at all.
Have you come from Bellario’s office in Padua?
It’ll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice.
Say, what’s the trouble?
I could do a great job with Hercules, or any other part that requires ranting and raving.
You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you.
Yes, you’re speaking very well.
Then he swore he was a stranger here.
Murder!
You must be crazy to say that!
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with.
I’m a surgeon to old shoes.
But how did you want it made?
I’ll look into it further.
Oh, how I wish we could oppose Caesar’s spirit—his overblown ambition—and not hack up Caesar himself!
And anything else?
God, not our strength, be praised!
Where is he?
We’ve got to act fast, my lord of the fairies.
I remember the plan.
Oh, your contemptible lady!
If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt.
He’s killed three people, and he’s so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die.
Enliven them with yours!
What a silly monster, to think a poor drunk is wonderful.
It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration.
Please, sir, have patience.
But he isn’t here now.
Oh God, Horatio, what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me, as no one knows the truth.
Get the lady out of here.
You sell fish.
But what about Cicero?
My lord?
Well.
No, not at all.
He’d be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail.
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
But you can’t blame me for her offenses.
Oh, my good lord, don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing.
What do you mean?
And servants of the Danish king.
Sir, he ate with this woman at the Porcupine.
But his punishment was bitter death.
Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly.
But step aside, fairy!
Indeed, I remember it well.
Yes, I see them coming.
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior, especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress.
There was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them, that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you, that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches, and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it.
I’m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me.
This is a majestic and harmonious vision.
Oh, only time can sort out this mess.
Goodbye, my lord.
I bet she’s fast asleep.
Leave Hermia alone.
Damn you all!
What kind of help do you need?
Fight?
Please, your Grace, tell me what crime I have committed.
Will I hear from you soon?
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from?
Do this immediately, and send him packing.
You’re under arrest, sir.
You rudely snuck out of bed.
Oh, control yourself, lady!
But it’s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost.
Thanks for that.
You’d better not wear your dagger in your cap that day, or he might slap your head with it.
Sister, I have a lot to say about things that concern us both.
Some dungeon.
Oh, that’s ominous!
Ha!
As for him, I never think about him.
It was yesterday, your highness.
I’m going to take it from you now.
Yes, sir.
Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings.
You represented yourself as just a common man.
He was the one who denounced his father.
You know, you’re right.
Treat me like you would treat a dog—kick me, hit me, neglect me, try to lose me.
On top of her?
A constant pain to me!
Well, thank you.
I believe drink did all of this to you last night.
I’ll show you how.
Merciful heaven!
Why do we party until we’re like animals?
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer.
Malcolm!
Now the only person I love, and believe in, and want to look at, is Helena.
Do you want to sleep?
Don’t I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and cannot love you?
Curse your families!
Menas, I’m not going back on shore.
Hey, Grumio!
and patches of righteousness.
Be quick.
Are you talking, you villain?
Yes, please; unleash your wisdom.
Regan, I hope you didn’t know anything about that.—Ah, who’s this?
The two of us will guard you while you sleep, my lord, and keep you safe.
Tell me, you monster, where is my son Lucentio?
What does he look like, Biondello?
How are you doing, Cassio?—Someone bring me a stretcher!
Oh, you’re so lucky!
I think it’s better to call it off.
Bad luck, bad luck?
Is your master coming?
And everything will be alright, I promise you, wife.
His horse is killed, so he’s fighting on foot, risking his life to search out Richmond.
Who’s the one who’s going out the door right now?
I’ll tell you as soon as I know, Richard, because at this point I have no idea.
Now, sir, where is Claudio?
Come, gentlemen, let’s go in.
Then he says I didn’t return some ships he loaned me.
I was sent for a rope!
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow, and this is the first time he’s done it?
But go away now.
Their dying shouts broke my heart!
Sir, you need a drink.
Yes, noble lord.
In my soul, I believe Hero has been falsely accused.
I know you well.
But we already swore, sir.
Don’t simply hide your hatred.
Dearest Olivia— What do you have to say for yourself, Cesario?—My lord, please— My lord wants to speak.
Now, I swear by Apollo… By Apollo, King, you’re taking the names of the gods in vain.
It’s strange that you haven’t heard.
My lady, with your permission, this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss.
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it.
Sir, this is the truth: you and the rest—all the people who have ever talked about her—have all been wrong.
Hey, if I’d remembered something about him, I could have had a good comeback for my uncle, touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine.
Rise, princes, and, with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords, rush to the battlefield: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France; you dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, Berri, Alençon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy; Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont, Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Fauconberg, Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois.
You’re right, actually.
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
You’re busted.
Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive.
Very well.
Kill him rather than let him leave this room.
What is it, Octavia?
What did he say?
Try to get him to do that.
It’s absolutely true, so take good care of it.
But tell me.
What’s this?
Let me see her.
Andrew Aguecheek”
Good running, Thisbe!
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.
Please, sir; crack jokes over lunch.
And don’t we have passions, and a taste for fun, and weaknesses, just like men?
Now I must go to the tomb alone.
If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place.
No, my good knight.
If you were a woman, I’d hug you now and cry, and say “Welcome back, drowned Viola!” My father had a mole on his forehead.
You won’t be seeing anything.—Hold his chair still, men.—I’m going to put my foot on his eyes.
Let me see.
Are you?
He’s alive and victorious, and Mercutio’s dead?
I won’t be a soldier anymore.
Yes, my lord.
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well.
I’m sorry I said anything.
That’s the point.
Take three times your money.
Sir, I can’t.
But tell me, are you speaking seriously?
Were you thinking of spending the night here?
But not for long; Charles will take care of everything.
Calm down, sir, please.
He is made of treachery, and has run away to avoid his crimes.
Please, just wait a minute.
Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said.
Hopefully when I get married, I’ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty.
You’re Lear’s shadow.
No, my noble lord.
Yes, I was, but I don’t want an answer from you.
Now let me see if I can translate it.
I hear someone coming.
No, to the Whitefriars monastery.
I’d better not drink now.
If you lie, boy, we’ll have you whipped.
The devil inside him is rough, but we can’t treat it roughly.
I’ll wait over here.
God, I’m really sick.
That will never happen.
How did this happen?
What do you remember?
It’s getting there.
So you had time as you were dying to look around?
Getting right to the point, I live near the Capitol.
As it dissolves, so shall my life.
Did I do anything good to myself?
Tell me.
It’s not for me to say.
Please, master, tell me.
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses.
Well, first there was the prince from Naples.
I’m glad to hear it.
He has his moods and his ways.
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening, but for now he has no fangs.
I myself, who am more indebted to you than anyone, have brought you this young scholar 
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham.
Let me destroy myself, let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours, let day remain dark and night sleepless, and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart, clean devotion, and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter.
Go away!     
You’re mistaken.
Our business now is mourning and grief. 
So you got what you deserved, and were locked up in this cave, which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be.
Hail, King of Scotland!
He’s married to Octavia.
So young and so cruel?
It’s all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary.
What do you say to that, Malvolio?
That’s what’s clever about it.
Get going now.
I’ll prove with my sword that I’m not scared of you.
And, moreover, God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden.
The king is coming.
Friends, go.
And then, I hope, you’ll be satisfied.
If even then they don’t answer to your satisfaction, you can say that they’re not the men you thought they were.
Iago, who started it?
Take me off to jail?
This means I’ve mistreated Edgar.
Get up, man!
A thin face, which you don’t have; a sleepless, sunken eye, which you don’t have; an irritable temper, which you don’t have; a neglected beard, which you don’t have—but that might not be so telling, since you don’t have much beard anyway.
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover.
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe.
I’m sorry you don’t have time.—Antonio, give this gentleman a reward.
I’ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you.
And don’t say all of that yet.
Oh, this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever.
Most noble Antony!
All this”?
A gentleman?
Talk to him.
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already.
Beware of the devil.
My liege, this was my glove.
Go then, goodbye.
She would have died later anyway.
Poison, I see, has been the cause of his death.
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels!
Enough, Captain.
No, someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal.
I’ll sleep over here.
How are you going to live?
Come talk to me about this.
Caesar, I will.
Me, sir?
To see an elderly, unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus.
Yeah, and he’s going to tame her.
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects.
Call the Duke of Burgundy.
I’m ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say—for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him, not the king.
Oh, in this love, you love your child so badly, that you go mad, even though she is in heaven.
The letters he spoke of may help me.
Why are you acting so angry?
So, tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated.
Pindarus!
When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you.
Don’t shed even one tear.
It’s true, this so-called “god”—he shook.
Stop right now or I’ll throw your dagger over the roof.
Yes, he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life.
I’m beginning to understand what you want me to do.
You do your job well.
Besides, you’re a sponge!
Silvius, keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me.
Do you hear, my friend?
I tell you, Captain, if you look at a map of the world, I’ll bet you will find, comparing Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, see, are very similar.
Tell us about this wrestling.
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents' feud.
I’d tell them that I saw natives like these—since they must be natives—who are graceful and well-mannered even if they’re monstrous to look at, kinder than most human beings you might find— kinder than almost any human.  
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love?
Nonsense.
Oh, that’s very nice!
Good friends, go in and have some wine with me.
Oh, kill me!
You’re both very precious to me.
As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much.
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don’t want any company.
We want Antony taken alive.
Take care of the lady.
Oh, you’re just going to talk about banishment again.
Yes, he is dead.
Is it all come to this?
Get ready, my lord.
We’ll all join hands and sing, and bless this place with our fairy grace.    
I’d follow you to the gates of Hell, you sneaky little devil!
This is what happens when you act rashly.
You’ll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing.
I probably am too young for you.
Don’t come near till you hear me call you.
To Adriana?
If a bloody head counts as a hurt, then you hurt me.
I speak to you as a plain soldier.
Here’s to your health.
What do you think I should do?
Then your lips will feel them more quickly.
Are you over your ridiculous mood?
But I agree, sir, that we were locked out.
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them—which most of our city did, for the sake of friendly trade relations.
Then if he loses, it’ll be his swan song, music before the end.
If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head, I would’ve killed them all in revenge.
Is that so?
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this.
Me neither, my lord.
Wasn’t Don John at dinner tonight?
Lazy people end up at the bottom, and you deserve to be at the top.
Stephano!
Do I know these men who are with you?
You lie, you disgusting tyrant.
The moon sets at twelve, right?
Evil spirit, I want to talk some more.
He’s starving me to death.
No, sir.
All the worse that she stooped this low, then.
Come on, I’ll fight you.
It’s not my fault he acts like that, Helena.
I wish to God that the golden crown that I’ll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain!
Perhaps  What, my love?
Well, well.
It’s all still yours.
Send something along to prove you’re withdrawing the orders.
They only feel the shadow of joy.
Good idea.
Now, no more questions.
He knows no more about the proper practice of war, see—the ancient practices—than a puppy.
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate?
You’re getting in the way of our work.
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood.
What does he say?
The English army, sir.
The more she
For three months.
Master, you were so focused on the girl herself, I wonder if you missed the main point here.
Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt.
Dear master, listen to me.
Hear me out, my lord.
Where is he?
Sir Toby Belch!
I didn’t say free, madam.
If you like, you can rest a while in my room.
I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older.
Reluctantly, I agreed–alas!
Please say no more.
He did, and I gave it to him.
How could I forget, my lord!
I’ve been tricked.
How are you, sir?
Or in the power of reason.
He’s coming, madam; but he’s acting very strangely.
Yes, I think that’s true.
I don’t think he wants to be disturbed.
Well, you’re a liar, then.
Leonato’s daughter had told us everything.
Listening to their frightened voices, I couldn’t reply “Amen” when they said “God bless us!” Don’t think about it so much.
He’s at home, my lord.
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib, since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them, while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed.
Your darling?
Fifteen years!
I’ll cry my tears for Romeo’s banishment when their tears are dry.
Really, I think your other ruff is better.
Then hurry up and tell me what you want.
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me.
I understand now.
Goodness, it’s daylight.
And he doesn’t let go of his target when a distraction appears.
God bless you, my friend, and your music too.
Then it must be Banquo’s.
Do you remember anyone who died of it?
I want my sword.
You haven’t said anything against the Duke of Cornwall, have you?
Your bedroom.
Well, to be on the safe side—so I don’t go back on my promise—I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days.
I am bound by oath, so please forgive me.
Quiet now!
Oh please, go somewhere else to blab your nonsense.
Let me be put to death.
There we go!
If I live to see you get married someday, all my wishes will come true.
Yes, dear little chick, come along with me.—Shut up, man!
You’re not really my daughter, but I still have one daughter left.
Hang our flags on the outer walls.
Soundly, my lord.
Too bad it fell flat.
If not, leave me alone, and I’ll stay away from your turf.
That I won’t stand for.
Caesar?    
But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt.
Yes, sir, they’re ready.
Maria, take care of this poor fellow here.
My name is Thidias.
Great Duke, be merciful to mortal men.
Well, when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites, the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns.
He thinks he’s still playing his instrument.
With that, I’ll be off.
Please, educate me.
justice will be rewarded.
The table’s full.
And request that she come here.
The best news of all is that we’ve located our king and our men.
How are you, my friend?
Is he alone?
What I’m saying is, your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity.
It is three o'clock, and, Romans, before night, we will try our luck in a second battle.
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own.
It’s a lie, you thread, you thimble, you measurement!
My lord, what do you want?
You will listen to me.
Yes, and she was mild too.
I almost recognize that voice.
See you soon.
Oh, my old master!—Who tied him up?
Indeed, my lord.
She’s well.
Your disloyal uncle—are you paying attention?
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.
Are you serious?
You don’t know my voice?
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen.
Let me deal with this.
If you interrupt this monster with one more word, I’ll beat you like a piece of salted fish.
My good lord, I still need you to like me.
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible.
Is it really true?
No, nor could the devil’s name be more frightening.
But what’s he like?
How will I recognize you in the future?
He’s standing ready outside the door.
Oh, eastern star!
It’s impossible.
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that.
Well, the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer.
Come here, ma'am.
But she must be, Friar.
Oh bloody Richard!
Good morning, gentlemen.
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large.
All of you who are looking at her, wouldn’t you swear that she’s a virgin, judging by these outward shows?
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people.
That’s how you’ll talk about me when you’re in this mood.
Richard is looking cheerful today.
I was about to swear that I loved you.
Don’t you care about me?
They shout for joy.
Look, here she comes.
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand.
It’s leaping about like a frisky horse.
Stop!
Darn it, if I’d guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman, I never would have challenged him.
Hermia’s not holding onto me anymore.
Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me!
Good night, everyone.
Duke, the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice.
If I may say so, your Majesty, your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward, the Black Prince of Wales—or so I’ve read in the history books—fought a very brave battle here in France.
At least two hours past.
Please, Signior Gremio.
Where is he staying?
I never saw the necklace, so help me heaven!
You’re making such a fuss.
No.
Now be quiet.
Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?
Please stop turning me around.
I’d like you to, see, because you don’t like it, and because it isn’t to your taste, and because it doesn’t agree with you.
Yes.
Look at the stars, see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold.
Good morning, Kate, for I hear that’s what you’re called.
Oh, my poor brother!
I thank your Highness.
Take him to my sleeping area.
Goodbye.
It’s a very pleasing night to honest men.
He must’ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he’s using it on a jester.
But for one reason they refused to execute her.
How can that be?
Good morning to you.
Destiny chooses when you’ll die and who you’ll marry.
Life, wealth, everything belongs to Death.
Out here everybody can see us.
Don’t make me do it, my lady.
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts.
Hurry up.
Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it.
Hermia is lucky, wherever she is, because she has beautiful eyes.
That may be true, my lord.
For you, I give myself away and I’m ecstatic about the exchange.
And to me, Denmark is a prison.
Go on.
Stop, for God’s sake!
The people have heard it already, and they’ve been told of his accusations.
And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that?
He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age.
How did you like the young German, the duke of Saxony’s nephew?
I swear on my life, which I take pretty seriously, even if I am a magician.
Listen to the noble Antony.
It’s a job meant for a man, but not you.
Not in my husband’s nose.
Yes, every man forward.
I’m a carpenter, sir.
Go to your bedroom.
As for his thoughts, I wish he’d think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time.
Where are you now?
Go and put on your own armor.
Congratulations, lady: you resemble a most honorable man.
Oh, is that Kent?
Be patient.
Good night.
Just give me a moment, please—only a moment.
Young man, when you wake up, if she’s nearby, beg her to cure your lovesickness.
So what?
Make it a word and a blow.
Your master and his servant are here.
A tailor made you.
Come on, sir, will you come aboard?
When did I  Do you know where you are, sir?
For a necklace your husband had him make.
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter.
That was me, but it’s not me— I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was, since I’m so happy to have since converted.
You’ve got a sword, Gloucester.
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic, grammar, geometry, and astronomy, I let my control of the government slide a bit, being too wrapped up in my occult books.
I’m going to let him live.
What do you say, Caesar?
Good fool, good jester, I’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle, and a pen, ink and paper.
But I won’t leave this spot, no matter what they do.
Say anything.
Quiet, I say.
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct, traditional principles and rules of war.
And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy.
I’m watching the play.
I guess it’s only one man—no big deal.
Didn’t I meet up with your allies?
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely.
The king isn’t the one sending you to the Tower, Clarence.
If a Jew offends a Christian, what’s the Christian’s kind and gentle reaction?
Have they come back?
Should we all give up and drown?
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia.
Gentlemen, welcome to Elsinore.
Ha ha, are you good?
Yes, you did, sir.
How green!
Can’t you wait for a moment?
When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better.
I don’t understand why they’re all here together.
The duke of Gloucester, who has command over the siege, is in consultation with an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman indeed.
No you haven’t, cousin.
Right, and well said.
Stay hidden and listen.
I told you not to hang around my house.
I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically.
You can’t do that.
Do you even know what you’re talking about?
Amen to that, Gonzalo.
Did you send for him, sir?
The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you.
Don’t be scared.
Richard.
Did Cicero say anything?
How will you wreck this marriage?
No matter.
Now, what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime?
But who’s with him?
It takes a wise father to know his own child.
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes.
Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it.
Then follow me and listen to my speech, friends.
down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this.
Oh, she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention.
Halt!
There’s only one body here.
I’ll cross myself.
Macbeth is ripe for the picking.
And so, on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought, our scene flies swiftly on.
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns.
As soon as you kill Prospero.
I say my prayers out loud.
Oh, ceremony, only show me your value!
Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust.
Oh, deadly sin!
Romeo?
Show her in.  
You should ask me what time of day it is, instead.
I’m not Cinna the conspirator.
Explain, boy.
It’s entirely possible.
Don’t worry about how I handle it.
Do you know Fluellen?
So do all thoughts.
Let’s follow him, Gertrude.
Sunday is just around the corner.
I hope that God restores you to health.
Give me details.
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs.
He’s laughing already!
They’re all ready to eat dinner.
The father and the master and the king didn’t order their subordinates' deaths when they ordered their services.
He won’t see my face ever again.
Look, love, see how devoted I am?
Tell me your idea first.
Please don’t cry.
What’s the trouble?
Now this joke has turned serious.
Here comes my wife now.
I recognize his trumpet.
Let him command me, and I’ll do whatever he asks, no matter how violent.
This is the man.
Play, I say!
Indeed, they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old.
Let me finish my curse.
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar.
Are you a god, an angel, or a devil, that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up?
Here, take my sword.
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.
Be bold, and get ready.
Sweetheart, go on.
What money, sir?
Come, let’s continue on toward your father’s house.
Why, this was modeled on a porridge bowl!
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe.
I wish I were, so I could deprive you of both day and life.
It is my rival for Bianca.
Well, thank God I’m cured!
Get it ready immediately.
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever?
Is it time, my Lord Constable?
I’ll meet you at your tent.
Here comes my lady.
It’s true that my brother’s daughter is Queen of Tunis, and heir of Naples.
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life, because the instant he strikes, he dies.
I can see in your eyes that you’re starving.
What a righteous judge!
Tell me where you’ve stowed away my money, or I swear I’ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I’m not in the mood.
Gentleness is the only way to go—gently, gently.
Will you kill him then?
No doubt, for you wear too many in the first place, and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer.
So were their daggers, which we found on their pillows, unwiped.
Ah, here she comes, angry and sad.
I’ll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars.
I swear that gown’s for me.
Give me access to them, and soon you won’t have to worry about them anymore.
I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids!
No one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve.
By risking the second arrow, I’d often get both of them back.
I’ll tell him right away, my lord.
Age is the thing that nourishes.
Do your best.
She’s yours.—Come, Ariel!
Our poor father, Clarence!
The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea.
From now on I will, cousin, and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us.
Dear God, thank you!
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums?
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him.
I’m out of patience.
Watch out, boy—remember I can whip you.
Which speech, my lord?
Then why be jealous of a person like that?
Who can prosecute me for it?
That’s too long.—Servants, leave her and me alone.
That’s very likely.
Are you headed to the Tower?
You’re wise!
To put it plainly, I’m afraid I’m not quite sane.
You couldn’t beat the two of them apart.
Go ahead.
I hope you’ll recognize me when we meet again.
Thomas, the earl of Surrey, and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers.
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers?
If there’s enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight, I won’t spend tonight in this town.
I won’t argue with her, so her beautiful body won’t disarm me.—Tonight, Iago.
But I still have a little memory left, and there’s still some fire in my eyes; my dull, deaf ears can still hear a little.
Let me play the lion too.
Okay, to the point.
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes; I’ll scratch them out.
By Isis, I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony, my best man among men. 
Watch me like a hawk.
No.
The heart won’t be reasoned with.
If you get what you want and you’re still not happy, you’ve spent everything and gained nothing.
Today, great duke, she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores.
Because I didn’t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails, or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh.
I’m very glad.
Oh, killing that child was the dirtiest, most merciless deed there ever was!
On me, though I am limping and deformed?
I’ll make him tell me the whole story again—where, how often, how long ago—and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future.
Just ignore him.
Stay here at your own risk.
If only I could spit poison.
Here’s something good.
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here.
I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise.
Now, your gown?
This is old Ninny’s tomb.
It’s not the right time to play.
Hearts cannot think it, tongues cannot speak it, meas-urements cannot calculate it, scribes cannot write it, bards cannot sing it, and poets cannot make verses about it.
What do you say?
Shame, eternal shame, and nothing but shame!
Is it a beggar?
My comfort is that old age, that poor preserver of beauty, can’t make my face any worse than it already is.
Why shouldn’t I?
Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now!
Yes, very bad.
What do you mean?
Very humid, I can’t tell you how humid it is.
How tall is she?
What’s the matter, husband?
I say she shall.—And first begin with her.
Enough of your magic spells, you hateful, withered hag.
I’ll give you the most expensive ring in Venice, and I’ll make a public announcement to help me find it.
Then we’ll be stuffed with news.
We’ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines, just like in a ballad.
Monster, use your fingers.
Who asked you to call her?
I’ll go get my sister and see what she thinks.
I want to measure the extent of your love, to see how far it stretches.
I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle, making your pain linger.
Look at other beautiful girls.
I won’t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me.
What’s her name?
Come break this up, Benvolio.
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard?
My lady would never want to lose him.
If everything else fails, at least I have the power to take my own life.
I am, unless I somehow stole this role.
The  Get out of here!
If not, then this parting was well done.
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity?
Call the messengers!  
Fast work and a little luck are all I need.—Brother, could I have a word with you?
If I were your average fool, or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody, or if you’d seen me first flattering men, hugging them tightly, and later slandering them behind their backs, or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble, only then, of course, go ahead and assume I’m dangerous.
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling?
My lord!
No, the whole day, and all night too.
The money you owe me for the necklace.
Then, hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it.
But when  You take up your duties too cheerfully.
No, it heals gradually.
Yes, on his front.
The Jew will have justice.
You can’t take anything from me that I care less about—except my life, except my life, except my life.
Let me shake your hand.
Oh, that most wicked fiend!
I loved Ophelia.
What news do you bring?
I’m sure it is to knight you, Captain.
And 
For besides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage.
In Orsino’s heart.
You’re appealing to a son who hates you.
The question is, how would being king change him?
That’s the weakness I’ll use to get revenge on him.
My daughter told me everything.
Put the goblets of wine on that table.
You can hope your father isn’t your real father.
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting.
He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish.
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath?
You’re a king’s advisor.
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend.
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws.
I found him here,  Beating?
I will, Caesar.
Come on, you’re fooling yourself.
No, I swear I’m not.
I suspect his friends will join us.
And even if they don’t, at least Hero’s supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity.
Again!
No more talk about killing yourself, okay?
A reason?
I don’t know what to say.
Didn’t you hear her, guys?
Who’s there?  
I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post.
And trust me, love, you look pale to me too.
He’ll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him, that’s for sure.
I’ll head to France soon.
Okay, just stay quiet.
It’s too hot.
Music, listen!
I can only say this about her: if she looked different than she does, she would be ugly, and since she can’t be anything but herself, I don’t like her.
Captain Macmorris, I beg your pardon, but would you grant me a discussion or two with you, see, partly touching on or concerning the practice of war, the Roman wars, for the sake of argument, see, and friendly conversation?
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers.
It’s nice you’re offering to sacrifice her behind her back.
We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us.
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince, anger Claudio, ruin Hero, and kill Leonato.
That will kill our lovers.
Oh, wouldn’t it be great if property, rank, official positions, and other honors were earned only by merit, not by corruption?
I’ll tell you.
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world, and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts.
It would be hard, almost impossible.
Thank you for all your efforts.
God bless you for being here.
Do we have devils on the island?
I have already.
Come along with me.
Is this the king we offered to ransom?
Do whatever you want, and I’ll say your insults are just a bad mood.
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter.
He’s at the duke’s morning and night, accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice.
I’ll send a man to Mantua, where that exiled rogue is living.
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack?
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry?
Please, all of you, stand up.
I believe you, and I ask you to forgive me.
Now I’m scared again.
If it is, I suggest you don’t eat it.
Lucius, who’s that knocking?
What do you want?
If our secret’s known, either Caesar or I will die, for I’ll kill myself.
The wiser the woman, the wilder.
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far!
Let’s go gather our jewels and money.
But I must go there, against my will: servants must fulfill their masters' wishes.
But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures.
I have a good eye, uncle.
He insists he’ll speak with you whether you want him to or not.
Are you all crazy?
Now I see it’s true.
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings.
You look angry.
This guy will tell us everything.
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage.
It’s too late to go to bed now.
I could cure you, if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me.
Well, then, that’s how it is.
You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter?
Now that I think about it, I really want it.
You’re in a hurry, are you?
I could do it myself.
Now get out of here.
I won’t live long enough, and all my efforts will fail me.
Antony will go where his passion is.
Did you mention that Edward’s children are bastards?
No, monster, not me.
If you leave like that, you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good-bye. 
One, so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling, and two, so that when their hair falls out it doesn’t land in their dinner.
I don’t completely distrust you.
Don’t say that—unless you want to be one of my friends.
Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both.
I like your new wig and headdress, though I’d like it more if the hair were a shade browner.
Oh, yes I am, father.
Ride to Salisbury.
What we are is up to us.
By Jesus, he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world.
Gentlemen, go in there and grab him.
Listen!
The man hasn’t done anything wrong.
When I reach the place he’s calling from, he disappears.
Oh, mighty Caesar!
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed.
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights, squires, and brave gentlemen, five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday.
It isn’t daybreak yet.
It’s strange, strange.
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought.
How unlucky am I, having to apologize for doing the right thing!
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do.
The king has heard them, but as yet has made no answer.
No, you’re just reminding me of something I’ve also noticed.
As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin.
I’ll tell my husband what you’ve said, Launcelot.
Twenty-five, sir.
The world’s huge.
The people fear me in the country and the town.
Oh, she’s a fine woman!
How do you both plead?
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom, shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight, and makes himself an artificial night.
I’m sorry, but I memorized what I’m supposed to say here today, and that question isn’t part of the speech I learned.
Then I guess I was misled.
He carries a third of the world.
I’ll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here.
Yes, madam, he lies beyond my reach.
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, Rosencrantz—listen as close as you can!
She could even what?
He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part.
Nurse, give my regards to to your lady.
When devoutly religious men are praying, it’s hard to draw them out of it, because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation.
Neighbors and friends, though we don’t have anyone for the bride and bridegroom’s places at the table, you know there’s nothing missing in the feast itself.
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold.
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won.
And I’d be surprised if he even did that, for he prefers sports, fun, and friends.
How are you doing, Charles?
To leave his wife, his children, his house, and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it!
So that’s what I’ll do, not because I love her but because I’ll get something out of it.
We’ll revenge his death.
Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the best friend I had.
I seek no revenge for myself, but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom, which you sought to destroy, that you must be punished according to her laws.
Can’t do it.
Yes, but how he adores Mark Antony!
You see how kind everyone is to us, how they just hand us gold.
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout, waiting to capture me.
It’s nice to see children playing well together.
Yes, pilgrim—they have lips that they’re supposed to pray with.
Who can tell me who I am?
She was here just now.
Come, Vaughan.
My lord, your promise of the earldom— Richmond!
Yes, your Majesty.
Who are all these people?
Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let this play do him some good.
If you like what you see of the land, the profit that’s possible, and this rustic life, I’ll be your faithful servant, and buy the place with your gold right away.
The change will be recorded as a precedent, and many bad legal decisions will result.
My name is Proculeius.
Here, at your service.
Have courage, man.
It’s worthless.
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned.
Excuse me?  
Bless your five senses!
Now, my dear friend, what lucky wind blows you in from Verona?
Don’t worry about me not swearing enough.
Where is kind Hastings?
Good point, and well said.
Your superiors.
Look, here’s where Cassius’s dagger pierced it.
And aren’t you a Montague?
By the door.
Check on your daughter, your house, your money!
You know, I saw the Duchess of Milan’s gown, the one that everyone praises so highly.
Cast spells with them, and “Brutus” will call up a ghost as well as “Caesar.” Now, in the name of all the gods, I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great?
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position.
It’s on such a high tide that we’re now floating, and we must take the current when it is offered, or lose our campaign.
If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight.
One of them was a man named Pinch: a hungry, narrow-faced villain; a skeleton; a fraud; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller; a needy, hollow-eyed, emaciated wretch; a walking corpse.
That’s no way to pray.
No, noble Romeo, you’ve got to dance.
Why so pale, my friend?
And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all.
I wish I had!
That’s a good song.
Oh, young and noble Cato, have you been slain?
I’d give forty pounds to be safe at home right now.
Get out of my sight!—Dear Cesario, please don’t be offended.—Get out of here, you barbarian!
Oh, are you here, Iago?
Oh, yes, I’m sorry, uncle.—If you’ll excuse me, your grace.
Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me were accidental, without purpose.
Yes, by God, that it is.
I’m happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor.
Mighty duke, look here and see a man who’s been treated most terribly!
I’d rather be wooed by a snail.
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?
He’s lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them.
By his dress I can tell he’s my countryman, but I don’t recognize him.
Then God be praised, it  Petruchio, do whatever you like.
And your experience makes you sad.
What’s going on?
Sir, I think I have the right to speak, and speak I certainly will.
So, possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery, I can’t awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness.
What, everybody falls asleep so fast?
Keep an eye on him.
She was tricked, divorced, wronged, spited, killed!
Not tonight, Iago.
Yes, sir.
I hear their drums.
What kind of man is he?
You’re better off because of your friends.
That’s right, except for the widow Dido.
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Lovers, moan and weep.
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships.
Where are you going?
I’m your advocate, and I’d rather die than give up on you.
Listen a minute.
But you turn that sun into a shadow.
Poison never came from such a sweet place.
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious.
Thank you, doctor.
I have a good plan.
I will, my lady, but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy.
And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?
I’ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven, praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year.
My uncle?
There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better.
Go ahead and ask her.
Well, all right then.
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague’s back, but instead it’s mis-sheathed in my daughter’s breast.
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne, my wife, is very sick.
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king’s crown three times, and he refused it three times.
I’ll help you through this business.
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl.
Oh, the glory of war has faded.
Be free and happy.
My master is being difficult.
He’ll accompany my wife, and bring whatever else you think I might need.
Go forward.
You won’t get any bad cooks from me.
What does he say about our marriage?
In a time like this, it doesn’t make sense to criticize every offense.
Wait.
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason?
And love doesn’t have good judgment either—Cupid, has wings and no eyes, so he’s bound to be reckless and hasty.
Since you love money and power so much, I won’t be your wife.
On the platform where we stand guard, sir.
That’s impossible.
Play, trumpets!
It is that.
Well, let’s hope your good fortune continues!
I was never a thief or a pirate, though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons.
Macbeth!
Please, let’s not talk about it.
The gods forbid!
This is how the candle burned the moth.
You go and talk to the duke so he won’t notice I’m helping the king.
I didn’t kill Lysander.
What’s this all about?
This guy doesn’t pay much attention to punctuation.
I almost feel you.
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o'clock.
A man, sir.
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken!
Pray well, father.
Now, by the world— It’s full of your ugly wrongdoings.
What’s your name?
Angry enough to run away.
To Brutus’s, to Cassius’s, let’s burn them all.
They both begin with the letter “R.” Ah, you jokester—that’s the dog’s name.
But I’ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining, the sons should be their fathers' guardians and manage their fathers' money.
No, sir.
I don’t hear anything, madam.
It’s a deal.
The clock struck three.
But here are other matters to be dealt with.
What’s going on in here?
I am willing to fight you if I must.
Pompey is making the most of our absence. 
Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores.
Why do I have to do that?
Either be calm and polite or I’ll drown you out with the music of war.
That’s my way, when I see a crab-apple.
giving it back to him.
Why?
Darling Kate!
Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight.
I would, my boy.
My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother.
My good King, surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over.
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate, he will mock death, and he will think he is above wisdom, grace, and fear.
How can I help you, sir?
But if you have to swear, swear by your wonderful self, which is the god I worship like an idol, and then I’ll believe you.
Fine, but you weren’t harsh enough.
Keep your money.
Oh, no question—it won’t style itself.
So you couldn’t see his face, then?
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible!
Hello!
He has epilepsy, a disease where you fall down.
I swear by Jupiter I’ll never revoke this punishment.
Yes, my lord.
Good luck.
Only too well.
No, I found it and gave it to my husband.
Come with me.
Mend” me, you impertinent fellow?
Ever since the Duke’s messenger visited Olivia, she’s been upset.
Yes, that’s it.
As my child, I order you to do so.
I’ll say good-bye now.
Yes, he has.
No, please, speak seriously.
Get away from me, witch!” the fat woman cried.
Is this true?
Yes, my lord.
What’s that noise?
I’ve heard about this indirectly, but I will send for him.
Dead.
Sister, let’s eat and stop worrying.
Just look.
He’ll be a good governor.
What is this?
I’ll drink as much as you do!
You refused me both.
Of all places, I don’t like the 
You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one.
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title—in French,  And even this I’m willing to grant if you request it.
But if you didn’t know about it, then you were wrong to get mad at us.
What is it?
Yours are slow and awkward.
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day?
All these aging faculties tell me—and I cannot be wrong—that you are my son, Antipholus.
And weren’t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends, like Aegles, Ariadne, and Antiopa?
What’s this?
On a night like this, pretty Jessica, in a bad mood, said outrageously wrong things about her lover, and he forgave her.
I’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight.
My lord, he will swear on his life that I haven’t kept a thing.—Tell the truth, Seleucus.
Anything.
That’s why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully.
You know that we parted only seven years ago, in Syracuse.
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him.
Oh, you idiot!
I don’t even know you.
If she’s a traitor, why then, so am I.
He’s fine and healthy, madam.
Come on, sir, please.
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you, for the sake of his honor.
Confess and love” is more like it.
What must be will be.
What did Northumberland say about Richmond?
How did her eyes get so bright?
Instead, lend it to me as your enemy.
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract, you’re just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud.
If he hadn’t been drunk, he would’ve really roughed you up.
We shouldn’t displease him.
Kind Tyrrel, will your news make me happy?
Who else should it be?
You look tired.
I’m whipped and tortured— May God give you a good evening.
The river in Monmouth is called Wye, but the name of the other river has gone out of my head.
We will do the same.
In the meantime, be patient.
When you’ve finished, you’ll be a happy man.
Be the person you know you are, and you’ll be as powerful as this person you fear.
Do you make your living by playing that drum?
Treason!
If the world were mine, I’d give it all up—everything except Demetrius—to be you. 
Self-love, my liege, is not so great a sin as self-neglect.
Hide her for a while in your house, and tell everyone that she has, in fact, died.
Make us your agents of revenge, so we can praise you when we’re victorious!
I thank you all.
Just like the rabbit, who lives where she is born.
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets.
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper, which I inherited from my mother, makes me forget how I should behave?
And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play.
Tell me, do I have your consent to kill them?
Ah, leave it alone.
My arm is sore.
I’m telling you, it’s not lost.
Won’t the ladies be scared of the lion?
Oh, go, leave me.
Farewell, then, Signior Lucentio.
If he’s so sad and solemn when he’s young, I can only imagine how much he’ll cry as an old man.
If not, then I have no powers of observation.
Yes, and be brief.
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize, my horse would be a topic for them all.
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you.
But like a misbehaved, sullen girl, you’re whining about your bad luck and your love.
Oh, Sir Toby, stop!
That is the key to long-lasting love.
Call him.
Oh sweet mistress, speak!
Lucius!
Lily-livered coward, what’s he doing there?
Wow, he’s a real devil.
As for Monsieur Malvolio, let me take care of him.
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend?
Have him come to me here, soldier.
Please rise, Queen.
Think like that, and you’ll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself.
He doesn’t know what he’s saying.
What could my sister’s letter to him say?
Who are you, moaning in the hut like that?
Know him?
One servant cried, “God bless us!” and the other replied, “Amen,” as if they had seen my bloody hands.
Even if it’s not better, your first marriage is over.
That’s an odd thing to say.
Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me.
Oh Clitus!    
Let me stand here until you remember your reason.
Not at all!
And so, my words and thoughts will be at odds.
My message is not for anyone else to hear, my lady.
Beware of March 15th.
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly?
What kind of scheme do you have going together?
Is that you, wife?
He’s going after a young widow.
Gravestones have been known to move, and trees to speak, to bring guilty men to justice.
Against my brother Lucius?
You corrupt judge, why did you let her escape?
It’s an outstanding army and highly motivated.
Help me.
Let’s see.
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were, and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is.
No, sir, she’s human.
That’s five to one.
What trade, boy?
If I gave them all I own, I’d have two fool’s caps for myself.
Oh, I wish she knew how much I love her.
The thing is definitely going to be sold.
Apologize?
The king’s a dear boy with a heart of gold, he’s a lively lad, a wag, born of fine parents, good with his fists.
You brazen whore!
If we can do that, everything will be all right.
I’ve always been straightforward with you, so now I’m telling you what I think.
This must be some kind of fairyland.
Nothing that interests me, my good lord.
I think he’s got the money.
Let’s give them room.
Then there must be no lovers in the forest, either, because they’re as good as a clock, marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour.
You’ve said what you have to say now.
God give him health.
Be silent, or else my magic spell will be broken.
You lying brat.
I’m a man, my lady, that God has made for himself to ruin.
I don’t
No, I am a Welshman.
Your words are idiotic.
What do you mean I faked you out?
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by, and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody.
That’s foolish.
Yes, Captain, but with this acknowledgement—that God fought for us.
Bandage my wounds!
If we’re all pork-eaters, we won’t be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon, even if we’ve got the money for it.
Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud.
She’s busy and cannot come!” Is that an answer?
Maybe it’ll come again.
Tell your wife to watch her.
Am I in France?
You mean the man who used to be Othello?
What kind of question is that!
The best plays are still only illusions, and the worst are just as good, if you just use your imagination to fill them in.
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’ possessions, which we seized in Sicily.
I’m smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter.
I swear I’ll smack you if you hit me again.
Then isn’t it just the right dish for a sweet goose?
Then the liars are fools, for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them.
Are you trying to start a fight?
Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head.
Yes, I am.
Oh, no, that was my lady’s voice.
But she’s modest and ladylike too.
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly.
He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me.
Don’t get up yet.
The cold wind’s still blowing through the hawthorn tree. 
It’s cheap and nasty!
How goes the battle?
I’ll think of something.
Our era should be ashamed!
You who are so skilled in cursing, stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies.
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater.
It’s time we hit the road.
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost.
I’m sticking to the contract.
Run to your houses, fall on your knees, and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude.
No, nothing.
This is Caesar you’re looking at.
Is that a lot of      He says his name is Master Fer.
But first, I’ll dump this fellow in his grave, then return to my love weeping with grief.
That is exactly why we wanted you here, your lordship—to avoid the public carping and complaints.
They see, smell, and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands.
The general is talking to you!
Sir, I know I’m not a flatterer.
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you.
I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger.
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night, and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story.
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world.
I was an idiot to take it!
You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister.
We took this pickax and this shovel from him, as he was walking from this side of the graveyard.
Don’t talk to me.
Yes, that’s it!
With any luck, the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind.
I wish I had never seen it!
No, vain illusion, so intricately bound up with a king’s rest.
That’s true.
You could have come sooner.
Take some men and horses and go to her.
He’s walking ahead of me, and he keeps daring me to follow him.
In his greatest need, even they will desert him.
I’ll take responsibility for that.
There are more than enough willing women around.
All right then.
You’re poisoning my eyes.
Challenge the count’s young servant to a fight.
I hear his footsteps.
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss.
Come on, Nerissa, I want to go see this man who’s come so courteously.
Good heavens, those are difficult directions.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy.
Their hounds are unequaled in courage.
Cowards die many times before their deaths.
Ah, how pitiful!
I held the sword and he ran on it.
Alas, why would you heap all these responsibilities on me?
I’m afraid we’re intruding too boldly on your sleep time.
Farewell.
Thank God”—that’s a good answer.
Catesby, fly to the duke.
Quiet!
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it.
Since this prize is yours, Be happy with it, and don’t look for a new one.
Oh, he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher.
True, he has an excellent reputation.
Oh, that bird from hell!
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim?
Well, is it not news that Petruchio’s coming?
Did you see him enter this abbey?
I’m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn’t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion.
How can this be?
Is this well done?
Don’t go,” says my conscience.
Young though I am, I’ve been observing these three blowhards closely.
What, have you forgotten me?
These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they don’t predict my future.
You should be ashamed, generals!
Well hello, my good boy.
Remember me.
And when will that be?
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now.
Go on.
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would.
But enough about that.
You know me too well.
Because it’s dark out, I’m afraid all this is just a dream, too sweet to be real.
Good-bye to you, the last of all the Romans.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no part in the killing, will benefit from his death—receiving a share in the commonwealth, as you all will.
The harvest comes shortly after that.
It’s stopped now—it must be played for some local god of the island.
I don’t know what private grudges they had that made them do it.
My God, I’m the highest-ranking person who speaks this language—if only we were back where it’s spoken.
If I default, he’ll pay you.
But even if I thought you were right, it doesn’t matter.
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me.
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work.
Gentlemen, gentlemen—   Gentlemen, don’t speak.
If you really feel that way, then I hope you won’t kill me.
Stand aside, Captain Gower.
I was ordered not to.
Now get on with your story.
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me.
How is she?
Don’t say anything bad about wine anymore.
I’m not a slut—I keep myself clean—but I thank God I am ugly.
Did God make him?
This is all quite pleasant.
You purple flower, hit by Cupid’s arrow, sink into the pupils of this man’s eyes.
You’re going to lose this bet, my lord.
Now in the factory of thought, create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets.
Oh, where have you led me, Egypt?
If you continue treating Hermia so badly, you’ll pay for it.
Ha, ha, ha!
Let’s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks.
He had his helmet visor up.
Therefore it’s certain that he wasn’t ambitious.
What you say is true.
In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she came to love me.
What do the priests say?
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener.
Did you inform them of that?
What do you call this?
But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman.
It took me two years before I had a single tooth.
Oh, blessed, blessed night!
Don’t swear by the future, because you’ve ruined it before it has even arrived.
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money.
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two?
What’s the news?
This is it, for now.
The watchdogs bark.
Have patience and endure.
I’m coming, I’m coming!
Henry the Sixth, crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy, succeeded him.
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything.
We’ll meet you at sea.
Stop—if you can’t be kind, at least have some shame.
Come down.
Damn it!
It’s like half your soul’s been ripped out.
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra.
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio.
It’s certain.
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world, carrying the name of Rosalind.
Oh, heaven, how did she get out?
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful.
I’ll do what I can to make you even more comfortable.
Here’s mine.
Go release them, Ariel.
If you’d like to talk tomorrow, I’ll come to your home.
That’s the way to do it!
Please, father, since you’re weak, act like it.
In order to find a mother and a brother, I too have lost myself, unhappily.
Give me a little breathing space, my lord, a little pause to think.
Yes, if I know the language and the letters.
If I had seen something like that, I would have quickly pulled out my weapon.
I say it’s the moon that shines so bright.
He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet.
Sir, it’s a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship.
Where is Lucentio?
Sir, he may still be alive.
If you can shape up, you’re welcome to stay in the house.
If he says anything against me, I’ll humble him, even if he were stronger than he is—and twenty punks like him.
Prepare the horses for your lady.
I think it’s important.
I know that, sir.
I can’t remember anything I’ve ever done to offend anyone.
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say.
Your behavior is an insult to all women.
Come out.
I have a daughter.
I know your position.
Yes, yes, this is the rope ladder.
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before?
I think you’re trustworthy one minute and then not the next.
How’s it going?
Montjoy.
So, she’s in on this too!
I have a daughter named Katherina, sir.
But listen, Charmian.
Ha!
But there is no end, absolutely none, to my sexual desires.
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn!
That our grandmother’s soul could end up inhabiting a bird.
He’s been seen there many mornings, crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs.
Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it?
But as for now—before two weeks have gone by, I’m going to send some people packing.
He couldn’t see you.
This’ll be a wonderful kingdom to live in, where they play music for free.
What will you give us?
Sister, calm down.
Let’s get out of here.
What’s wrong?
So, by Christ, I’ll cut off your head.
If she restrained your rowdy knights, she had such a good reason that you can’t blame her for it.
Now, good sweet Nurse—Oh Lord, why do you look so sad?
Is it a habit of his?
Then she was even more an angel, and you’re an even blacker devil!
He was so sharp when he was in school.
He should swear by his two-faced self, and that’s an oath I’ll believe!
Go home to bed, Francisco.
I think so.
But come on, start.
I’ve never been taught how to make anything.
What are you doing here in Elsinore?
Because you gave me something for nothing.
I’m sure Lorenzo isn’t on their ship.
Yes, fashion is fashion.
You’re right.
No thank you, my lord.
Yes, gentle cousin, if it were light enough for you.
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen.
You don’t really love me.
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy!
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off.
I swear by my sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth.
You aren’t wood, you aren’t stones—you’re men.
Those who have done this deed are honorable.
Oh, what misery!
Well, go along now.
Sweet Sir Andrew!
It is.
I wish I knew what is happening.
He won’t listen to anyone’s advice.
Write to him from me—I’ll sign it—sending greetings and gentle good-byes.
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions, which were overwhelming her.
If you can’t answer it— Go ahead!
Let them start something.
We’ll see, won’t we?
The Phoenix is my house?
I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances.
Here comes Sir Toby, limping.
But what am I afraid of?
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready.
I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied.
I’ll think over what you’ve said, I’ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say, and I’ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters.
I’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now, if it’s okay that I’m picking up what others have thrown away.
Well, it doesn’t matter anymore.
Someone adored me once, too.
I’ll leave you now.
She will be pleased.
Absolutely.
If he did that, it would be a charitable deed to hang him.
Yes, alright, go, I say, and bring him here.
Yes, ma'am.
Can’t Lord Stanley sleep?
But oh, how odd it is to have to ask for my child’s forgiveness!
I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood.
I’ve seen her do it.
Oh, they continually urged the king to do it.
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs.
And if she starts to drop off, I’ll rant and yell until I wake her up.
By God, I order you to speak.
Then, like prophets, they named him the father to a line of kings.
But taste my story, and relish it by paying attention.
My dear lord, if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity— I know what you’re about to say.
I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” Answer me!
Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.
I will.
They show their bloody heralds of battle, and something must be done immediately.
How do you feel?
What, are you crazy?
The voice kept crying, “Sleep no more!” to everyone in the house.
Me neither.
I’ll be back quicker than you can think a thought.
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet.
Why is that?
Why, Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant, and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably, as slaves.
So what’s the story, old boy?
Where have you been, sister?
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night, she looks out Hero’s bedroom window.
You get trickier and trickier.
Good-bye for a while.
There’s music coming out of thin air.
But I’ll punish them thoroughly.
My own safety is the only important thing now.
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance.
If you don’t need it for some important reason, then give it back to me.
Right on cue.
If they’ll do neither, we’ll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings.
I wish you were what I wanted you to be!
Meanwhile, their  They’ve said their prayers, and now they wait for death.
He will, sir, if He wants to.
You’re a smart guy.
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them.
Go home!
Have them come in front of the master constable.
And your father was Duke of Milan, and you were his heir, a princess.
This is Decius Brutus.
He has brought you figs.
Then love me, Rosalind.
If you want things done in the right way, you’ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice.
If I may say so, your Majesty, as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to.
But sir, he’s crazy.
That our clothes were drenched with sea water, but they came out looking brand-new.
Gremio, this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca.
I promise I’ll carry the wood faster.
This choice was as foolish as they are.
I’ll torture him.
Go back with her?
You’ll have to bear with me.
In this day and age, if a man doesn’t erect his own monument before he dies, he won’t be remembered past the funeral bell’s ringing and his widow’s crying.
Speak plainly.
Not true, not true.
Something’s wrong, the man sounds panicked.
To our horses, you gallant princes.
Why only a few courtiers, my lord of Buckingham?
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to.
That’s for to me to decide.
I think it’s too rough, too rude, too rowdy, and it pricks like a thorn.
Oh, come on, woman.
But, Lepidus, go to Caesar’s house.
Now I’m alone.
Why, she was dead before you were even born.
Tell me again, where did you leave those lowlifes?
I said so, dear Katherine, and I’m not ashamed to repeat it.
It’s best to rehearse there, because if we do it here in the city, we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play.
Upon my life, my lord, I’ll do it.
But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust.
Don’t you 
Tubal, a wealthy Jew I know, will supply me with the cash.
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill, in sight of Caesar’s navy.
What stunning, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty—but please, tell me if you’re the lady of the house, because I’ve never seen her.
I don’t want anything but that.
Adieu.
I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me.
All right, then.
There is much to be learned from these converts. 
We have consented to all reasonable terms.
Otherwise, I’ll die a virgin, devoted to you.
I’ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say.
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.
A strange fish.
I hope you’re not drowned.
Don’t hurt me, please.
Let lightning spit fire!
I’m sure of that.
Edmund, where’s your wicked brother?
Wait a minute, gentlemen.
Well, how nice, a riddle!
He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it.
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke’s to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
When I have praised Antony, I’ve disparaged Caesar.
Before I open this letter, please tell me how my good friend is doing.
Even if the news is sad, tell me with a smile on your face.
You are welcome here, my friends.
You’re too bitter.
Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones.
Excuse me, my lord?
There have never been orphans who’ve suffered what we have.
She was too good for me.
As for the food, it will be served in covered dishes.
We’re following you not only because it is our duty, but also because we want to.
We have  And one of them is the criminal Deformed.
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string.
We’re to be married on Sunday.
That’s not your fault!
My God, that’s my handkerchief!
Repent and avoid damnation.
Listen to this.
Give me some light!
Is that what he says?
You should tell Antonio what you hear—but don’t do it suddenly, because it might upset him.
How?
That duke who lives nearby is courting her.
It’s time to reassess the situation.
You’ll see, I promise you.
It may be, it certainly may be.
Why do you spit at me?
Signior Tranio, you also took aim at that bird, though you didn’t hit her.—So here’s a health to all who’ve shot and missed.
It’s not okay!
Let’s say I didn’t kill them.
Good night, good night.
We’re sitting ducks for the French, if they only knew it, for there is no one guarding it but boys.
Get out of that position, because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop.
Is tomorrow the 15th of March, boy?
I hope you’re right.
He has one ship bound for Tripoli, another heading for the Indies.
No, by Our Lady, I’m not such a fool to think what I please, and I don’t please to think what I can, and in fact I cannot think, even if I could think my heart right past thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love.
Well, I’m not sorry to hear that, because they have always been my enemies.
All right, I will.
Friends, go your separate ways.
Are you laughing at what I say, as if I were a fool?
We have to go out and talk to them.
It doesn’t matter how I am: he hurt me, and that’s that.
Me too, I swear.
Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this.
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination.
Then right next to him I saw the murderers, dripping with blood, their daggers rudely covered in gore.
Let go of him, peasant, or you die!
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa— What, what, what?
Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts.
Yes, if that would be all right with your Lordship.
If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous.
I assure you, sir, the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below.
She’s a fine woman, all right.
A worthy fool!
Sir, please, don’t be angry.
Call that servant back.
Then she has no choice but to hate you, as you purchased her love with murder.
I got him to leave, and made up an excuse for your trance.
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself.
Good.
He and I will make up.
The next person to strike again dies.
As you were on land.
Leave me alone.
Don’t you have a letter for me from the friar?
I mean, with my head in your lap?
Was he sent by Count Orsino?
I’m ready to hear you.
What’s the news!
Who could have restrained himself, who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it?
What a miracle!
Why are you waiting?
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them.
Hold on a second.
I rejoice in his good fortune.
Lovell, go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
Drive it out of you.
But don’t delay.
It’s as strange as this other thing which I don’t understand.
C’mon, I might as well say the fool’s the fool!
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what’s good for you.
Here comes your father.
Oh, that’s pathetic!
Long live Theseus, our famous and respected duke!
Thank you for saying that, your Worship, but we’re just the poor duke’s officers.
Please give me a little credit!
I don’t know, and he won’t tell me.
Yes, as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint.
Come, come, I know what you’re referring to, Richard.
Just a bit of my dry humor, sir.
I can’t speak any more. 
Do that.
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur.
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there.
Set fire!
Goodbye.
It’s already almost night.
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago.
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady.
What am I, a cane?
You’ll take the mustard or you’ll get no beef from Grumio.
Be eloquent on my behalf.
Don’t look so sour.
In these less dainty times, you’re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him.
Can a good thing hide itself?
Help!
Phoebe wrote it.
Insolent  Oh, the good gods!
I may command the one I love.” Well, she commands me.
My dear Portia, if you knew who I gave the ring to, for whose sake I gave the ring to him, why I gave it to him, and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn’t accept anything but the ring, you wouldn’t be so angry.
They haven’t been commanded to go to the west, mighty king.
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company?
Why are you talking to me like this?
It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself.
Oh, you lowlife!
I want to hear more about this.
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant.
Miserable England, I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced.—Come, lead me to the block.
If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to England.
In short, I’m not.
Don’t do it, sir.
Goodbye.
From Silvius, sir.
Well, the point is, he’s lost a ship.
And Cassio’s killed?
There’s still a bit of daylight in the sky.
The things that threaten me have only seen my back.
Yes, sir, but not when I’m enraged.
Very well.
Look around you, Caesar.
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly?
You think I’m a sponge, my lord?
And you’re my husband, right?
Oh, what a sad day!
That’s noble of you, master.
Because, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
But you’d still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil.
No man must know.” What if this someone were you, Malvolio?
I’m not Stephano, I’m a walking cramp.
If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens.
Armed, sir.
Come on, we have to follow the leaders of the dance.
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy.
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows, and then—with public accusation, blatant slander, pure hatred—Oh God, if only I were a man!
They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.” And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well?
Swear by my sword.
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring.
Let me have your attention for a moment.
Yes, sir, I have.
I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier.
She confessed.
Now please, tell Beatrice to come out.
Is that how the law sees it?
He couldn’t be a lion if the Romans weren’t such easy prey.
That’s my sister.
I’ve said what I have to say.
But God forbid he says no to us!
It’s not in the contract.
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down, crying, “Ow, my butt!” and starts coughing, and then everyone laughs and has fun.
Yes, my lord.
Who are you talking about?
And as king I’ll love you forever.
If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard, then play that.
Be quiet for a while.—Robin, take off his donkey head.—Titania, get the fairies to play some music, and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before.
Come on—kill me and brag about it!
No way, then, I’ll run.
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him?
A king, perhaps— My lord— How is it that the prophet didn’t tell me at the time that I would kill him?
Oh, my son, my son!
Well, I wish you liked me.
We’ll never see each other again.
Being too old to marry someone young.
Well done!
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me.
Go ahead, swear to that, so you’ll be damned to hell for lying.
What else you do know?
He made my heart leap for you.  
Oh, mischief has ruined our plans!
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave?
Iago, I’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you.
Good riddance!—Close the curtains and leave.—I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice.
Let’s not stay here with them.
Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what.
The drink, the drink!
Portia, goodbye to you.
I’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil.
And you have mercy on me too!
By this token, you’ll be admitted to their cell.
Mantua.
That you love my daughter to spite your soul.
Snakes shed their skin there, and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
Give me my fishing rod.
My pretty children, both of you misunderstand me.
Stand up if you’re really a man.
No, let them go.
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world.
It’s been longer, it’s been longer.
How should madmen hear, if wise men can’t even see?
Although I can’t make his ship disappear, I can still make his journey miserable.
But she is wise.
Therefore tell me the Dauphin’s mind frankly and without constraint.
A mischievous child.
Everything we’ve heard is bad.
Well then, sing a lullaby to your generosity: it’ll nap until I come back.
Go bring them here.
Where is the number of our English dead?
Look, here comes a walking fire.
Is it gone?
Get up and listen to me.
My learned lord, kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn’t bar me in my claim.
The bitter one is the other one—that’s you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool, boy?
All this is comforting news.
I swear by my holy order, I thought you were smarter and more rational than this.
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Listen!
That light we see is coming from my hall.
Lucius!
Calm down, Smulkin, you fiend!
I’ll help out, if only because he speaks the same language as me.
Thanks for telling me.
I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits, because then he always has a lot to say.
I ask that none of you leave, except myself, until Antony has finished.
Let’s listen to the moon.
A golden mind doesn’t bend down to choose something worthless.
He’s not wise enough to be brave.
Do so, and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me.
I think he’ll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple.
Are you talking about the crown?
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide.
If you say one more word, I’ll punish you, maybe even hate you.
Let me go with you to Belmont.
But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts.
Were you talking about Juliet?
You need to leave to take care of your own business.
Any villain in Denmark is going to be, well, a villain.
For God’s sake, would someone bring me a mug of beer!
And because I know how fond she is of music, playing her instruments, and poetry, I plan to hire live-in tutors for her.
Kill!
Malvolio, your vanity is damaging your good taste.
Benvolio, who started this fight?
He’ll run after her.
Lorenzo, that’s for sure, and I’m also sure you’re my love—who else do I love so much?
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him.
I’ll tell you at a better time.
The clock’s just striking twelve.
He’s a good soldier too, lady.
We’ll see them immediately.
You slander her, you devil.
My gallant girls!
But are they all safe, Ariel?
Come on, “nothing” will get you nothing.
It’s driven me crazy.
Give us a smile.
I’ve outshot you, and not for the first time.
What’s this man’s reputation like here in the city?
Exactly like that.
Who heard me do that?
If you let her go this easily, Sir Andrew, you don’t deserve to ever use your sword again.
If you do intend to live, then mourn.
What does this mean?
Inside, sir, with the earl.
No, he comes to be married  Lady, do you come here to be married to this count?
Are you the slave who, with your slanderous words, killed my innocent child?
I should have waited to tell you my news.
Anyway, what’s up?
And it’s too bad, Brutus, that you don’t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself.
Oh, he’s good at bending words around!
Faster, Eros, faster.
Then I’d be punished for the sins of my mother.
Your words, like your wounds, bring you honor.
Your brothers?
Why, she’s a lamb, a dove, a child compared to him!
You bring your cauldrons, your spells, your charms, and everything else.
They told me I was everything.
Thank you kindly.
These revelations have overwhelmed her.
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
So young, my lord, and honest.
When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” Well put.
Wake up!
You couldn’t see him, but I could.
What’s this?
I’m feeling very low, and I need to sleep.
The man who killed Mercutio, which way did he go?
You have broken my heart.
Let’s go!
Well then, you must be in love.
Excellently, excellently.
I’m sorry about your daughter’s death, but I swear our accusations were true, and backed up with proof.
Flies can kiss her, but I must flee the city.
What do you think, madam?
Say something!
Is that how it is, countrymen?
Is it feasible?
Oh, to think you’ve been rejected!
Madam, I’d better leave now.
You’re asking me!
Tell me, Friar, in what part of my body is my name embedded?
How long has he been possessed like this?
I’m like the one sick sheep in the flock, the one who deserves to die.
It won’t be long before I’m back.
Have you forgotten who I am?
Yes, as short as a woman’s love.
No, it’d be a sin to think such a low thought.
I’m going to make sure I stay on your good side, lady.
If things go well, bring the crowd to  I’m off.
Let’s dance to “You Jerk.” You mean, “Shut up, you jerk”?
This used to be a great puzzle, but now I’ve solved it.
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness.
And leave you out?
Benvolio is part of the Montague family.
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?
Here comes the good Macduff.
Yes, she’s young and tender.
I’ll do well.
That’s the beginning of the day we see, but I don’t think we’ll see the end of it.—Who goes there?
What features?
When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air.
You lie.
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us.
Tell me what you did with the king’s ship, the sailors, and the other ships.
Yes, you’re right.
Drunk?
She shall be buried next to her Antony.
Go immediately, and do exactly as I wrote down.
In that case it’s good to be a post.
And in return for this gift, he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms.
I swear, I could do so much— Please, no more.
Like medicine for a sick man.
Oh, there’s been a lot of quarreling.
I’ll do it, sir.
Please, young man, don’t make me angry.
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy?
break out, civil war erupts, kings are betrayed, and the bond between father and son snaps.
He told us to arrange it.
Whichever of you acts shy, I’ll swear she has corns.
You’re the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned.
I will fight him there.
He constantly offends me.
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone.
If you see me without it, you can be confident I’m dead.
What disease is he talking about?
You see how the world goes, Volumnius.
I swear I’m not lying.
But why did you tempt the heavens like that?
My lord, I swear to you— Oh, don’t swear!
That’s what Fulvia told me.
Did you see the weird sisters?
We’ll have a couch made up that’s softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful 
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them, like a slow-acting poison.
First kiss me, Kate, and then we will.
His courage is hidden, and when it is revealed, it will shrink.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Hopefully, your wedding day is only postponed.
My lord Sebastian, even though what you say is true, your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time.
With all my heart.—Three or four of you go welcome him.—In the meantime, I’ll read Bellario’s letter out loud.
That’s him.
There’s a feud between the two dukes.
Good duke, come receive your daughter.
You teach me how I should act.
I’ll fight brutally.
Please stand up!
Why, would that have fixed my hair?
God bless you, Bottom, God bless you.
This is the most miserable hour of all time!
Honest, yes, honest.
Doesn’t Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice?
Do you really speak like such a gentleman?
Is that Barnardo?
If only I could somehow relate them to me!
Robin Starveling, you’re going to play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the handyman.
You’ve stained your virtue with your own actions.
If he doesn’t like it, he can go live with my sister.
The tunnels!
No.
Will you be patient?
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable—the most precious things in your life, those strong bonds of love?
Here come the conspirators.
I’ll let you get away with skipping the praise.
What can I do for your highness?
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail.
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio’s dead.
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of.
Who are you?
God protect you from them and from other false friends!
Yes, yes!
He’ll tell you more of the story.
Is this a dagger I see in front of me, with its handle pointing toward my hand?   
I think this country is so kind that if it weren’t for
If he’s ready now, so am I.
You once stole my position; now you get to have the grief that goes with it.
tody of them so I can do what’s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom.
That’s why your desires are wolfish, bloody, and ravenous.
Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has.
Understand?
Yes, I do.
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise.
At this time of night?
You gave money to me?
I have forgotten why I called you back.
To repay her for her troubles, Death Gives her undying fame.
I wouldn’t change it except to make you think of me, my darling queen.
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me, kick me—even kill me.
Now, now, both of you gentlemen!
Let it fly out.
Do it, and shout like the city’s on fire.
Believe it.
No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long.
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor.
Oh, Iras, Charmian!
Your children will be kings.
Did you notice?
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life!
Well, what’s going on, mister?
Worse and worse!
Here I am, your slave—a poor, sick, weak, hated old man.
Don’t saints and pilgrims have lips too?
They don’t want you to go out today.
Oh, conspiracy, are you ashamed to show your face even at night, when evil things are most free?
Let’s discuss it some more.
I had a dream last night about the three witches.
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm.
No, my dearest love, I wouldn’t cheat you for the whole world.
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord.
Now that’s patience!
It’s too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection!
We can’t all be masters, and not all masters should be followed.
Has it come to this?
We’ve been looking for him everywhere.
Conrade, I say!
Now, Eros.
It’s all over now, and so am I.  Let’s forgive each other.
Lay out the gown.
I won’t follow him around with useless pleas anymore.
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men.
Here.
Set it down.
Look behind you, my lord.
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul?
Let’s not talk about it.
I’m at your service.
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back.
Your friends at Pomfret, they’re the ones who need a priest.
It’s time for us to stand guard.
almost read people’s thoughts.
Sir, sir, that can’t be true.
What a worthy man!
Madam, what should I do?
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Me too.
Day has broken.
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, killed!
You can be a eunuch, but I’ll be mute.
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war.
Ah, good old Kent said this would happen—that poor, banished man.
Oh, that’s disgusting!
Give me your hand.
Edward’s sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne, my wife, has bid good night to the world.
In a king, the sight is unbearable.
Take care of the queen!
Come with me, Silvius.
Go inside yourself.
That’ll keep them from being afraid.
You too, Fabian.
Aren’t you Romeo?
His eyes were as green as leeks.
But, tell me, where is the noble Richmond now?
Block up my house’s ears—I mean the windows.
Not if you want to keep your arms!
Do you have any doubts, Antonio?
If I told you I understood Greek, I’d be lying.
What, should I stab him while he sleeps?
You’ll find us both at Crosby Place.
Well, it must have been Signior Benedick.
Knock.
Oh, you’re a clergyman?
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done?
By St. Paul, ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmond’s soldiers could, dressed up in their most sword-proof armor.
If it’s that important, then let the women die.
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up.
Caesar’s speed defies belief.
Because of your advice and your help, I have a high position now.
What’s the matter?
God bless you.
Oh, heaven help me!
Oh, this is terrible!
A boy robbed you, but you’ll beat up the post instead.
I wouldn’t want to stay here and make you angry.
Don’t be offended.
Welcome, Publius.
Is that you, Iago?
I knew from the first it would be this way.
Let’s not argue here in front of both our armies, which ought to see nothing but love between us.
Ah, where’s my servant?—Give me some brandy.—These griefs, these pains, these sorrows make me old.
The men there won’t give a penny to a lame beggar, but they’ll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit.
I was.
Is your name William?
What country is this, friends?
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub.
I’ve come to say farewell to my king and master.
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears?
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty.
Play me some music.
Welcome, traveler.
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta, when you know that I know about your love for Theseus?
But you can’t see where you’re going, sir.
I regret my crime more than my death, and I beg your Highness to forgive me, while punishing my body with death.
Now, daughter Katherine?
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight.
Sirs, never mind.
Oh, good, a knife!
No, with Demetrius.
To escape the decree condemning me
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked.
Here he comes.
But, go on.
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him!
I have no idea what you’re talking about, Hamlet.
I can’t talk now.
You know where I’ll be waiting.  
How did you sleep, my lord?
If you sit down, I’ll carry your logs a while.
What?
I nursed her daughter, whom you were just talking to.
We’ll be there.
Now, noble Buckingham, seal this alliance by embracing my wife’s friends, and make me happy in your unity.
What music should we play then?
I’ll fight at sea.
I’ll be damned if the duke wouldn’t have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus. 
You know me well.
My brother is imprisoned because of you, I am disgraced, and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren’t worth a dime have suddenly been promoted.
I was his daughter when you banished him.
He’s not standing straight enough to hold a flag.
The Emperor is calling for Canidius.
Give me your hand.
I’ll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you.
Master, knock hard upon the door.
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses.
Ha!
What’s the treasure, uncle?
I can’t, ma'am.
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred.
Speak, Claudio, that’s your cue.
It’s the smartest partition I’ve ever heard speak, my lord.
Not true.
Yes she has, and by keeping celibate, she wastes her beauty.
Life is a story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning.
It’s a friend of Antony’s.  
Oh, you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider, that hideous toad!
When I have the juice of that flower, I’ll trickle some drops of it on Titania’s eyes while she’s sleeping.
Murder’s always horrible, but this one was especially horrible, weird, and unnatural.
Don’t you hear me speaking?
But I will tell you this very plainly: I have challenged Claudio, and either he’ll accept the challenge or admit he’s a coward.
Well, do what you want.
No problem, madam.
Everything depends on this: either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions, or leave in disguise after daybreak.
Besides, the king’s name is a tower of strength; the opposition doesn’t have that advantage.
But just be patient until we’ve calmed the masses, who are beside themselves with fear.
That means it’s high time for me to go.
Get rid of your low-class trapping,” she said.
I say that I love you more than he does.
Don’t say that.
It must be something I did accidentally.
Oh, most bloody sight!
Please answer, my good little student.
Think about it.
Oh, this day has turned into a disaster!
But I’m as immovable as the northern star, whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky.
Up to the breach, you dogs!
I wish I’d been there.
You all know this cloak.
While we’re walking, you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night.
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear, an armor-plated rhinoceros, or a tiger from Iran.
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances.
Do so.
Who are you?
Have her send it to me.
More, more, please, more.
Have you seen Master Lorenzo!
Such exercise!
Don’t refuse it.
Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you.
Sir, a word before you go.
Since you’re old and respected, you should be wise.
I’ve been looking all over for you.
Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness’ pardon.
Oh, my handsome nephew, I must not say that.
Why do you want to do that, my lord?
Or else love is blind, and its best time is the night.
He never did harm that I heard of.
I won’t hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people’s searching eyes.
His neigh is like a monarch’s command.
Tell me.
Well, we were all born to die.
Your threats don’t scare me, Cassius, because I’m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze.
What’s she doing now?
Iago.
So, tell me, assuming I win your daughter’s love, what dowry would she bring to the marriage?
No, you should tell him to hold his hands!
She’s been drowned in salty sea water, and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again.
No, sir, worse off.
His body will lie in my tent tonight, with the honorable observance that suits a soldier.
If she won’t tell Benedick, someone else should.
She was filthy!
I came here crying.
I’ll scratch out your eyes, even if they could fly.
And that would be—?
Yes, let’s do that.
It’s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours.
No, it doesn’t mean anything.
He’s praying now.
Go, hurry.
Yes, boy, I’m ready.
Good night, good boy.
There’s no darkness except ignorance, and you’re more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog.
Tell us when you wish to get married, and may God give you joy.
And then?
What’s that noise?
So what’s going on?
I’d rather go without the money.
I don’t think it’s a good idea.
His name!
You’re supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back.  
With God’s help.
No money, I swear.
Shylock, are you listening?
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it.
What did he say?
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature.
Make it eight and eight.
I will perform this ceremony every year.
Do you know him?
Take it away.
I know where he is.
Othello?
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries?
Oh, oh!
Then pack up your instruments and go away.
Sir, your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities, though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin, and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him.
Oh, dear!
No, I swear by my life and soul!
She was worried about my absence, and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong—which I found out at the same time as the news of her death.
Hello, Roderigo!
This messenger is wise.
Where’s Romeo?
And before I make her normal again—I can cure her by treating her with another plant—I’ll make her give me that little boy as my page.
Until then, think about the well-being of Rome.
Meanwhile, I’ll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge.
If we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home, then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation.
An honest guy who’s as poor as the king.
With a needle and thread.
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly, you’ll see.
How can a tailor make a person?
I’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can’t have.
Leave me alone.
Come on, Sir Andrew.
I told him you were asleep.
There comes an old man with his three sons— It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale.
Oh, my good master!
Was it long or round?
I have news—old news such as you never heard before!
You would make a nasty suitor.
Who talks of my nation?
I know you’d never skip school.
Yes, I will.
He hadn’t arrived by the time we finished eating, so I went out looking for him.
I’ll put her on that.
Oh, she’s ten times nicer than her father is mean, and he’s the height of crabbiness.
But go ahead and charm her, gentle Paris; make her love you.
You’ll never hear from the herald again.
I’ll be right next to you.
Once more I come to ask you, King Harry, if you’re ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat.
You’re right.
That was a poor unlucky beggar.
Please, try to act a little more serious, or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me, and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia.
Come on, do you think I can’t recognize you by your excellent wit?
Oh, are you really!
You’ve made up your mind, then?
Where’s America and the West Indies?
You’ve been competing with this king for my daughter.
Heaven knows I am.
Adieu, good Mr. Depression.
But oh, what a deceiver he turned out to be!
Hate it, fear it, do not come inside.
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar.
Yes, yes.
Then I have offended no one.
But you should hurry anyway.
How beautiful the moonlight’s shining on this bank!
But jealous people don’t think like that.
Any minute.
I like her more than I can say.
It’s him!
Do you like me, Kate?
Now I know better.
My lord?
Why not?
Who here is so vile that he doesn’t love his country?
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse.
Oh, excellent!
Is he right?
Pull them apart.
He certainly is.
Why would they do that, my lord?
My prayers, you hussy?
Tomorrow night, when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light (the time of night that always hides runaway lovers), we plan to sneak out of Athens.  
I bet she’ll chew him out.
Come on, I’ll take you, but honestly I’m only doing it out of pity.
Shame on you!
That her father’s brother wants to be her husband?
No, it’s Casca, someone who’s going to work with us.
Well, I wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness, since the boy turned out so well.
It’s probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey, thinking to spend the night here.
Either there are wars in heaven, or else the world, too insolent toward the gods, provokes them to send destruction.
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home.
She’ll be damned for it.
Bring Desdemona here.
If  Well, I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation, in order to focus on the happiness of yours.
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs.
In a way” is the right way to go.
Sit down and rest.
If not, to tell you I will die is true, but not for love, by God.
Please, give it to me. 
My father’s ghost—armed!
If your vengeful heart can’t forgive me, here—take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul, which adores you, can be free.
Yes, madam.
I have to obey. 
I bet you’re a happy fellow who doesn’t care about anything.
The queen and her elves will be here soon.
Well she was, good Curtis, before this frost.
Whenever you’re ready, hostess.
It’s his handwriting, my lord, but I hope he didn’t mean what he wrote.
Don’t wake her.
You know what I intend.
Ask him in here.
First let’s go to dinner.
My master is standing out in the street!
For the sake of your father’s memory, make peace.
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona, which you asked me to steal so many times.
Yes, please tell me.
I think if we had fought, we would have proven too young and strong for them after all.
No, you’ll see, four days will quickly turn into four nights.
Take these too.
Captain Macmorris, I think, see—correct me if I’m wrong—there are not many of your nation— My nation?
Many times, madam.
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together, don’t you?
Because she’s been chosen by Signior Hortensio.
Anyway, Jessica, go inside.
I pray that God ends his life before I die, so I can say, “The dog is dead!”
Sex and marriage are honorable things—even for a beggar, right?
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit.
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations.
At least it’s possible in Denmark. 
Then please, put off your eating for a little while I, like a mother doe, find my fawn and bring it food.
Let playful people with light hearts dance.
The duke will be here tonight?
But Edward is still alive.
If you like, we’ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need.
But I could see that Cupid’s fiery arrow was put out by watery, virginal moonbeams, so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love.
This is beyond words and beyond belief!
That’s a stupid thing to say.
It should work.
It’s a good thing he’s here to recommend himself.
Are you good or evil?
Pass the order along.
It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.
Good-bye.
You’ll make me angry.
Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.
You’re not answering my question.
I’ll ask only Benedick to come with me, for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he’s a joker.
Have you ever cured anyone this way before?
But please, tell him how well I faked a faint.
Don’t go back until I’ve carried the corpse into the marketplace.
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
What should I call you when you’re a man?
What have you heard from her?
I have to eat my dinner now.
I’ve become an enemy to my own soldiers!
The devil’s advice is nicer.
I like it better than laughing.
I’ll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I’d run from a bear.
You sound like a cattle dealer: that’s the way they sell bulls.
I’m a poor man who’s been humbled by many misfortunes.
No, he hasn’t.
Come, let’s have one more extravagant night.
That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports.
This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace.
I’m not holding your hand, sir.
You, will you join with me?
What can I do for my lord?
Oh, my son, what issue is that?
Farewell.
Will they see us?
Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend.
Be quiet, people!
Tell me your secrets.
And I hope you realized I wasn’t very happy about it.
But that’s just a fairy tale.
Have you not spoken to her since then?
Goodbye to you all.
There are parents living whose children you have butchered; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old.
You’re trying to trick me, my lord.
Then sure ones.
Sounds good to us.
Do you remember her face?
My new master is expecting your approach.
It’s a strange snake.
He is indeed worthy of the name “horse,” and you can call all the rest beasts.
Why, you’re absolutely right, cousin.
This is a small house.
Don’t waste any time.
Yes, just now, my lord.
Go in, or we’re done for.
But now we don’t have to!
Please have a seat.
The higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest.
He may recover yet.
Good-bye, son.
Be merciful and say “death.” Exile is much worse than death.
You come with me, uncle of Exeter.
And so do I, my lord.
What’s the matter?
Brutus will lead, and we’ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city.
It’s getting late.
I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die.
What’s this?
I’ll vouch for that.
I’ll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
And as you know, his connections, if he put them to good use, might be enough to hurt us all.
But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrain myself.
So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist?
I’m making a kind offer—zero percent financing.
With the permission of Brutus and the others—for Brutus is an honorable man; they are all honorable men—I have come here to speak at Caesar’s funeral.
Bring us the letters.
I am a villain.
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them.
You don’t need it yet.
Oh, here comes the storm again.
Absolutely, yes indeed.  
I don’t like it.
I’m not interested in being good.    
Come on.
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was.
When storms arrive early, you can expect the harvest will be damaged.
But we can talk more about that tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both.
Do you dare kill a friend of mine?
Things are what they are.
But listen to me; let me guide you.
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing, and the church bells chime—one, two, three.
Hey, let’s have some music here!
No, Lysander.
Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause.
A very nasty meaning.
He calls me “boy” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt.
I’m not going to eat dinner tonight.
But how?
Now you say it was “Knock at the gate”?
She looks like she’s washing her hands.
Who’s there?
Besides that, he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow, and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him, who are at the other, sorry.
By watching their show, you’ll find out everything you’re likely to know.
This week he was sad, moody, and depressed and very different from his usual self.
Thank you, master.
I will, in other words, kill you in three hundred and fifty ways.
Listen to me, good brother.
Then heaven have mercy on me.
Is it possible Fulvia is dead?
I hope that, after I tell you my news, you will think better of me.
If you’re as poor a subject as he is a king, you definitely are poor.
From then on we’ll turn our backs on Athens.
I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart.
Calm down.
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment.
Hail, Caesar!
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did?
More, please, more.
I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock.
Here, 
Lord, how you’ve changed!
What’s the matter, lady?
Hey, bride!
That’s the truth.
Well, we’ll stop, then.
Who are they following?
What a storm!
The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more. 
These are tricks of the imagination, and this place is filled with magicians.
Yes, Lepidus.
I can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive.
All this fighting is because of you.
So please, old friend, give us some good advice.
I’ll straighten it, then play— Where’s the Queen?
Don’t worry about the cost.
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.
Let them go.
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you.
We can’t be in two places at once, both here and there!
Where do I live?
Sweetheart!
Stop, sir, for God’s sake!
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you?
If you had foul words in your mouth, then your breath must be foul, and foul breath is nauseating.
Let the gods judge me!
Or stuff what he says into their pockets.
But his investments are uncertain right now.
That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope you’ll do the same.
In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants?
Then let’s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next.
Who does time amble for?
Get him, he’s a thief!
No, sir.
Were his wounds on his front side?
He swears he used to be a courtier.
Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it.
God will free you from blame.
Is it out of lust?
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime.
We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards, whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone.
That’s enough for me, then.
As for those who have, I beg you to excuse the gaps in time, and the many people and things that cannot be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form.
If you tell your lady I’m here to speak with her, and bring her out with you when you come back, you might make me more generous.
Here comes the noble Antony.
You always know he’s got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto.
God have mercy on us!
He is a noble prisoner!
Yes, that’s the one.
Who doesn’t know that the good duke is dead?
Let’s go, Menas.
So you want to put a man in your belly.
What does he say about Brutus?
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep.
Don’t stand there shocked.
Who’s there?
Isn’t that true?
Now go, leave me.
Nothing, but this is true.
There’s no bravery in an unfair fight.
Oh, I’ve read that.
Yes, like that.
What’s the news abroad?
Let’s go to him.
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world: when we’re down and out—often because of our own excesses —we put all the blame on the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if they forced us to be bad, or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid.
We hope you feel better and find some peace.
But Lysander’s so attractive that he’s turned heaven into hell!
I hope she keeps it short.
I humbly thank you.
I’ll do that, because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him, Rosalind.
Good lieutenant, is your general married?
Nature, I don’t accuse your weather of unkindness.
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner.
I wouldn’t even pee without dancing a waltz.
Some achieve greatness—” What are you saying?
Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only.
Are you making fun of me?
Isn’t that your habit?
Tut, tut, you’ve become rather icy.
Forget your epilogue.
Did he lose his other eye?
If you don’t mind, I need to rest a bit.
Here comes the owner of one piece.
And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so.
No, my good lord.
Then by all means never let her walk in public.
Oh, Bottom, you’ve changed!
My spells are working well, my spirits are obeying me, and everything is right on schedule.
There was no need to tell me to get out of there.
I’ll take responsibility for it.
Yes, why not, my lord?
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city?
He cried out, “Wait for me, dear cousin.
Be good.
Antony.
He’s recruited Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; the King of Pont; Herod, of Judea; Mithridates, King of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, the kings of Mede and Lycaonia, and many more.
Swear by my sword you’ll never mention what you’ve heard.
You are the best of the cutthroats.
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument, hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us?
Go where, my lord?—Cesario, my husband, stay here.
Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true?
Don’t give it away.
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth, the true heirs of each royal house, be joined together!
To Baptista Minola’s house.
In that case, I don’t much care for you either.
As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.
Can’t he pay back the money?
I slept well, ate well, and was happy.
My friend, your husband, the honest, honest Iago.
I did, Malvolio?
The poor thing!
It’s a good thing you’re not a piece of fish.
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous.
Watch out, Ophelia.
My spirit friend, Harpier, is yelling, “It’s time, it’s time!” Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails.
What kind of game is this?
Yes, with Cassio.
Don’t you think so?
Ah, no.
Your guardian angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s not around.
Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined.
We might as well call him a man, since God created him.
Dear Macduff, I beg you, tell us you were lying and say it isn’t so.
Dolabella.
I wish I could work for that lady!
Oh, Tranio, until it happened to me, I never would have thought it possible.
The level meadow, where the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover once grew, has become useless: unmowed, it grows to seed, so that nothing springs up but weeds, rough thistles, barren plants, and burs.
Some people will laugh at anything, and others are so grouchy they won’t even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny.
No gentlemen, don’t get ready to go now.
It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted city’s native citizens, should be gouged with arrows.
Ratcliffe, around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor.
What, you look amused.
You have some plea for Caesar, don’t you?
No.
You’ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before.
No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.
That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long.
I grow old, and all dignity has been thrashed out of me.
Get out of my face.
Tybalt’s death would be bad enough if that was all.
I’ll go and chat with Paris.
And that’s why he went crazy.
He’s as brave as a fox.
No?
How’s that?
I’ll talk to you again tomorrow.
Haven’t you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger?
I’m glad to see you.
The only thing different about me is my clothes.
Stop, for God’s sake!
I’ll follow you, my lord.
Are you always so funny?
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak.
If you let go of your power to attract me, I won’t have any power to follow you.
What then, sick?
I just know I’m not one.
What do you think I’ve got on my head?
You’re bleeding a lot.
Do you love me?
If she and I are happy, what’s it to you?
Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic!
So did I.
You’re on.
Listen, but don’t speak.
Friar!
Whose was it?
Let me unbutton this.
Me, marry her?
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you.
Go back with her?
He’s just as terrified of Sir Andrew.
I will, sir.
Let him run far away.
In my imagination, Horatio.
Pinch my nose?
It’s even stranger when an angel is so angry.
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him.
Oh, the poor bird.
I sent for you about a sad occasion.
Why, Fool?
But quiet.
Come here.
I’m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger.
Leave us.
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints.
Three months from twelve months of the year.
Please let her speak.
A snake did do it, because no snake ever had a more forked, lying tongue than you have.
Why?
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain.
He is close to death, but not dead yet.
I’m afraid it will  I’d love it.
Shame on you, Demetrius!
It’s pathetic to be Caesar.
I won’t be kind to you.
I won’t bother with it.
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians, and you ignored my letters, where I argued that he was innocent; I know the man.
Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love.
It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to attend.
It’s a play about ten words long, which is the shortest play I’ve ever heard of.
There was a noise, that’s certainly true.
That’s true, lieutenant.
Some villain has told lies about me.
She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor?
Give me your hand.
You can heat your iron up in here.
Tell me, you unknown power— He can read your thoughts.
You make me so happy.
In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys.
Now, Iras, what do you think?
I’m not a fighter.
Peter Quince— What is it, jolly Bottom?
No.  
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I’ve ever seen.
Enough, enough.
Can’t a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick, sneaky lowlifes?
Tell me who shall have the better luck, Caesar or me?
I feel sorry for you.
Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him, but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him.
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
Richard loves Richard, that is, there’s just me and myself here.
I’ll meet you there in an hour.
It’s expressly against the rules of combat.
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again.
Most royal sir, Fleance has escaped.
As a child, he took such a long time to grow up that, according to his rule, he should have grown up into a gracious adult.
Do you think they’re married?
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy.
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs.
He wants to be crowned.
Do something about it, then.
Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand.
Get it, sister.
I have no personal reason to strike at him—only the best interest of the people.
Yes.
Give me your blessing.
This song’s about my dead father.
No I won’t, even if you were one of the worst demons in hell.
What does it matter?
person when you’re ready, if you’re inclined.
But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself.
And what is that music?
He’s only known you for three days, but he’s already treating you like a close friend.
As a favor to  I’m delighted.
The night has been chaotic.
Oh, I’m dying, Horatio!
My memory is hazy, more like a dream than a recollection.
Remember what I’ve told you.
So go and put your stamp on the girl.
I’ll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice.
If Echo were as fast, he would be worth a dozen like Belman.
If I find an opportunity, I will give him a piece of my mind.
Of course he is, and so are you.
Give me those flowers.
Your eyes are like stars, and your voice is more musical than a lark’s song is to a shepherd in the springtime.
Sir, you’re old.
You haven’t seen anything, then?
Well, it’s not for me to say.
I’m Trinculo—don’t be scared—your good friend Trinculo.
Be quiet, Signior Gremio.
The lack of time and the risk I’m under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other’s news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long.
Twelve years ago, Miranda, twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan, a powerful prince.
What, are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to?
Harry le Roy.
I wouldn’t have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds, to be paid by the shah of Persia.
Let’s go, we’ll obey you.
He’s welcome here.
What does this mean?
Indeed, before he fell down, when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown, he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut.
I wish he’d go away!
About as old as you are, my lord.
Please—and I’ll pay you plenty for this—help me conceal my identity, and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want.
Speak confidently.
I say “force” because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this.
I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a good time.
It’s two o'clock now.
With all my heart.
What a wonderful time to be alive!
Do not run away.
I’ve never been your enemy.
Here is the count of the slaughtered French.
And like I am for no woman.
Why are you calling him a jerk?
The Lord keep him from the title of king!
I know that my lady’s going to end up hitting him.
Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying.
That sound you heard was the  It was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.
His speech was like a tangled chain.
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace.
And there’s nothing I can do about it.
Come, let’s go.
So the fool follows you.
then I hope I have a life of misery!
You’re not going anywhere.
Don’t worry.
If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this.
If she lives a long and happy life, then all women may as well turn into monsters.
What, did you cheat on us before we deserved it?
You know I’m powerful enough to make you pay for this.
Are you biting your thumb at us?
You’re on your deathbed.
How many, can you guess?
Please walk softly, so not even a mole hears us approach.
Who’s Thisbe?
That’s all there is to it.
His military understanding is all theory, no practice.
Now I’ll offend you whether I give it to you or not.
But oops, when I let go of your hand, I let go of the biggest joke of all.
Right away, Caesar.
If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood.
And still do, I swear by my hands.
I said she was.
I wish you were someone else’s son.
We have to get out of here, old man.
It’s not true.
I would’ve given it to you this morning, but a madman’s letters aren’t Gospel, so it doesn’t matter much if I’m a bit late.
Shame on you, warped hag!
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless.
Tell me, is it missing?
Here, here, sir!
How horrible!
Excuse me?
He’ll be like this for a little while.
If arguing makes us sweat, the real trial will turn that water to blood.
Are you still so cruel?
What a fool I’ve been!
Oh, madam, madam, madam!
Good Enobarbus!
You’re wrong, you madman.
Where do you come from, sir?
Come here, Sir Seacole.
Yes, that’s the idea.
All I’m saying is that strange things have been going on.
And although we’re giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we’re doing, he’ll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold—groaning and sweating under the load, either led or pushed, as we direct him.
Easily, madam.
She’s dead, like a beautiful flower, killed by an unseasonable frost.
I’ll get you for that.
Get me a surgeon!
But did I fall or not?
Shake my hand.
Come, explain.
This isn’t the death of one man.
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother.
He can’t speak, my lord.
Let me go, I say.
We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room.
Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog, as dark as hell, and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can’t run into each other.
That’s true, sir.
Our men have all broken ranks.
Let me go.
You do the same, wherever the crowds are thick.
He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others.
Those cowardly, gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef.
A messenger from Lord Stanley.
Good sir, stay close to me.
Did you hit your head?
I will settle this matter. 
Six Barbary horses, six French swords with accessories, and three imaginatively designed carriages—sounds like a French bet against the Danish.
And I’m going to sleep.
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style.
But not the woman who scolds, anyway, I hope.
With my music playing in the background, I’ll lure fish.
I swear I won’t, sir.
Oh, good Demetrius, will you find him for me?
I’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a good, honest person, sir.
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners!
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Well then, you have good reason to be sad.
How low we can fall, Horatio.
If I live through this, I’ll be good to you.
So I’d like it copied.
Where’s the Queen?
And though I wouldn’t dare to swear that you love me, still my blood begins to flatter me that you do, despite the ill effects of my face.
Either my eyesight is failing me, or you look pale.
Where have I been?
Answer me straightforwardly.
Who do you think you are, keeping me out of my own house?
His most horrible murder.
I can only repeat what I’ve said before.
Is the king awake, worthy thane?
He’s my prisoner.
You did—not just once or twice, but twenty times.
Yes, it truly is.
But as I said, the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now.
Will you be having dinner with her tonight?
And what is the subject?
I’ll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe’s face.
I like singing.
The king will be angry with him.
But you can make it up to me.
You don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word.
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles, traveling on the ice in sleds.
That Lodovico is a good-looking man.
make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills.
Soak your hands in blood and gore, since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors.
Has Banquo left the court?
Because it will make you angry, and that will get me another beating.
Oh, dear!
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband.
I don’t know what I’m doing.
Happy with Hermia?
This is the prophecy that the wizard 
You can’t get out of trouble by praying or crying, so don’t bother.
One criminal punishes another.
Are you ready, sir?
We’ll send Mark Antony to the senate house, and he’ll say that you’re sick today.
Goodbye.
Say goodbye to me.
I’m not sure I can wait that long.
Well said!
Let’s see, how can I
I’m sorry, you were saying?
Yes, my good lord.
Get out of here, good Fleance, run, run, run!
Your voice is loud and commanding, but you look like a working man.
I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say.
That too.
Madam?
How did my master die, Strato?
Drink up.
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut.
Come on!
What do you mean, my lord?
We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday.
Goodbye.
Oh, please, Prince Dauphin!
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that!
He received Caesar’s letters, and he is coming.
If only you were, sir.
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was, but you wouldn’t answer me, instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone.
Right.
Mistress, your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister’s room.
Good morning, Caesar.
When his god falls asleep, the monster will snatch his wine bottle.
You have amazed me.
This isn’t a good moment for jokes—save them till a happier time.
You resent my friends' rise in society, and my own.
If you keep on the way you’ve been going, you’ll kill yourself.
Oh, Caesar, read mine first, for my petition affects you more directly.
Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we’d had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters.
I’m a friend, a friend who knows you well.
I won’t move to please anybody.
She’d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit.
I bet my life on it.
Hail!
Please, just look over there.
For love to appear in his true likeness, he would have to be as Cupid is: naked and blind.
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed.
Follow my mother.
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you.
Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance?
Just cry out, “Ah me!” Just say “love” and “dove.” Say just one lovely word to my good friend 
Cut yourself?
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical.
God should keep me from false friends, but they weren’t false.
You mean, to bear me, not to bear        My protector, Richard, insists on it.
Yes, and a nice one at that.
The marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
I didn’t call you.
You’re cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust.
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended.
He has some wonderful home furnishings—that’s what he calls them—that he’ll use to decorate his house when he gets one.
But let her live.
Tell me what you’ve done with the money I entrusted to you.
You’re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner.
Send for him, dear uncle.
You should be ashamed of yourself, Satan, you liar!
Better, since your lordship was nice enough to ask.
I’m afraid he’ll punish me.
What’s going on, Malvolio?
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands.
I’ll tell you what to do.
My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it.
You’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven.
Tell me one.
We’re in God’s hands, brother, not in theirs.
Do you hear that, men?
You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around.
It’s true, I confess.
Please, leave me alone.
He’ll recover his sanity there.
Someone knocks.
You didn’t do anything else to earn this punishment?
It scares me just to hear you talk about it.
If they refuse to come, get physical—use a whip if you have to, but get them out here to their husbands.
Really, my lord, I don’t know what to make of it, but she loves him with such a passion that it’s past all understanding.
I’m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other.
And I had to be away!
He is like a god and knows the truth.
Here he comes, my lord.
Absolutely.
Anyway, what should we do?
You’re doing the right thing.
Something there isn’t a word for.
But you’re still my child, my flesh and blood—or rather you’re a disease in my flesh, a disease I still have to call my own.
Come, my sweet Kate.
Lucillius and Titinius, order the commanders to have the men camp for the night.
Your delicacies aren’t worth as much to me as your welcome is.
Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldn’t be here calling them merciless.
The poor rude world doesn’t have her equal.
That’s not how I do business.
I cannot blame you now for weeping.
So don’t think that I’m drunk.
She shall, Lucentio.
Write down “Master Gentleman Conrade.”—Gentlemen, are you good Christians, and do you serve God?
But I will go out, for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me.
I wish she’d never let you come.
O Lord, I could stay here all night listening to such good advice.
And now that I have the boy, I’ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong.
He claimed to know that already too, and said that’s the reason he’s come to speak with you.
You wouldn’t have dared, out of fear for your life.
It looks to me like it’s burning in the Capulet tomb.
I see the downfall of my family.
Come, take away the  Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton.
Your answer?
My lord is so heavy!
I wouldn’t do it for a nice ring, or fine linen, or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats.
I think I can do that.
There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again.
Why?
Yes, my lord.
When you have to steal your own wives some day, I’ll wait for you just as long.
It’s true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter, and she loves him—or else they’re putting on quite an act.
And we’ll leave together, like friends.  
Let’s be light-hearted.
Good-bye, great commander.
Run away, I beg you!
I’d rather be a peddler.
Wake Duncan with your knocking.
What are you going to do?
If we do, it’ll drive us crazy.
I won’t miss any chance to send my love to you.
But when our vices become habits—Oh, the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our ruin. 
I will see you tomorrow, then.
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest.
What, are you dead, my dove?
That’s what he said.
Damn it, you’re not listening to me!
As for me, I’m surrendering all my power over to him, giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life.
Okay, who does it trot for?
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up.
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon.
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm, but I’ve come out here to find you and take you where there’s warmth and food.
Go to her and tell her for me.
But whatever misfortunes occur, they can’t ruin the joy I feel with one look at her.
I don’t mean he’s 
If anyone doubts this, let him put me on trial.
Who said that I was disdainful, and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book?!
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear.
Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of tyranny.
That’s one of them.  
Didn’t you go to her for a purse full of ducats?
Give me the goblets.
I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do.
Do you have news from Verona!—What is it, Balthasar?
I’ll look at him and try to like him, at least if what I see is likable.
The next day I explained all this to him, which was as good as begging his pardon.
Then it’s confirmed!
No?
She will have a seat—you heard my daughter tell you how.
He’s right over there.
Macbeth!
Find out the way, and I’ll find the right man.
Since I can’t amuse myself by being a lover, I’ve decided to become a villain.
Sir, the laws of Ephesus will be on my side, and you’ll be embarrassed.
Goddammit!
Where is the fool I sent on ahead?
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy.
I’ve botched the job, friends.
But a lot of old people act like they’re already dead—sluggish, slow, fat, and colorless, like lead.
We seemed to have two separate bodies, but we had one heart.
Let’s go to the temple first.
The day is well on its way.
My cousin’s a fool, and you are too.
I hear his trumpet.
Have you heard any news of impending battle?
I can’t believe it.
I won’t say a word.
Goneril with a white beard?
I, who have heard the rumble of guns in battle—and thunder in the sky (heaven’s version of artillery).
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play.
What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you?
What horrible thing are you imagining?
Pray God your wife doesn’t send you a worse one.
She stood and spoke.
How am I unfaithful?
Like gambling, sir?
Nice to see you.
Give me some trinket of yours, and I will wear it in my hat.
The island must be mild, and have a temperate climate.
I will go lose myself, wandering up and down throughout the city.
Does it mean being truthful?
Do not, Phoebe.
I must leave them and seek some better employment.
This is some monster of the island, with four legs, who seems to me to have some kind of ache.
Meanwhile, we’re the ones who need you.
He brushes his hat in the mornings.
Signed,    The poorly treated Malvolio.” Did he write this?
Shame on Romeo!
Is it good news?
I know the glove is a glove.
And its tears are wet.
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome.
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him I’d given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house.
This morning, they’ve flown away and in their place are ravens, crows, and kites, flying over our heads and looking down on us, as though we were sickly prey.
Please go find out for certain who has arrived.
for the other men, we can make them believe anything we choose.
But please, tell me: is he coming home?
What do you want?
Regarding the Dauphin, you can speak to me.
She’s a remarkable lady, if the rumors are to be believed.
Are we all here?
I’ll follow.
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable?
Sing my praises to your mistress.
He was not born to be shameful.
These men all have one intention, and it’s directed against Caesar.
No, you shall not.
It’s my master who’s not getting the reward he deserves, not me.
This is exactly how she always looks, and—I swear it—she is fast asleep.
Of all the strange things I’ve ever heard, it seems most strange to me that men fear death, given that death, which can’t be avoided, will come whenever it wants.
However, I’ll do what I can for you.
Oh, so cruel!
Goodbye!
They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men.
What if your husband strays elsewhere?
It’s better that you didn’t kill him.
You’ll be back at two o'clock?
This harms my reputation.
Tell me.
It’ll help us more than hurt us.
It’s almost morning, but I’m sure you’re not fully satisfied about what happened.
The muffled queen”?
The Duke’s in a meeting?
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely, but I won’t stay in any case.
Who, me?
They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands.
Who pleaded with me to pardon 
With one little toss of his head, He can scare you off for good.
Leave them alone until he sets off home, and then follow him.
I’ll wear this one and none other.
Please.
Wind and rain can’t wash it off.
Let’s go.
Not now, my sweet Desdemona.
A sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that, even as an apprentice.
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap.
There’d be no work.
You bastards!
You will feel the loss, but the man you weep for will feel nothing.
But if your soles are worn out, I can mend you.
Unless I’ve mistaken his battle flags, which I’m sure I haven’t, his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king’s mighty army.
This is as bad as the tortures of hell.
I hope we have the time some day!
Well, anyway, goodbye.
Take your cues from my own despair.
I’ll break my spells and bring them back to their senses, and they’ll feel like themselves again.
I hope you sleep peacefully.
He’s a conspirator.
Come inside with me, and I will tell you my plan.
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute.
Because my name is George.
Go to the gate.
I’m coming, my lord.
What a sad sight!
It’s half of all my money.
Please, tell us.
But they are dead, and you killed them, you slave of the devil.
But I know you’d never force me to tell you things I don’t want to, so I should be polite and tell you what I can.
Please, marry us.
Look, my love, what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
Alas, you don’t know.
Who do you obey here?
Oh, yes, we could, sir.
That’s good advice.
Me too.
Brutus” and “Caesar.” What’s so special about “Caesar”?
She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband.
Thinking, my lord?
Well, go on your way, then.
From under the earth.
A better example—come on.
It just happens, the way gentle rain drops on the ground.
They want to talk.
Have them come in.
What’s going on here?
Where is Montjoy, the herald?
You can’t get any more money out of me right now.
One of them is too much like a painting of a man—he never speaks—and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy, always chattering.
To hell with this idiot!
This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them, just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile.
Why, that’s my dainty Ariel singing now.
It’s bad news when a country is ruled by a child.
God protect me from these two!
Come on, let’s go to prison.
But listen to me, Gratiano.
How are you, your highness?
Is my father well?
You’re naughty.
It’s clear that someone less noble, less loyal, more bloody-minded than Clarence but not a blood relation, deserves as bad an end as my brother, but he goes free.
Gloucester, Gloucester, I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
Will you meet me right away at Ninny’s grave?
I repeat, spread the rumor that Anne, my wife, is sick and likely to die.
Well, explain—but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn’t used up by talking about it.
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them, separating our nobles from the common men, for many of our princes—alas!—lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers.
According to what I heard, they had no travel plans as of last night.
Speak.
That’s enough for one lesson.
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you.
Good-bye.
Treat me well.
Let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that again.
When we’re in love, we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds.
Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight!
I’d like to get to know you better, Mr. Cobweb.
I’m here, sir.
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming.
If the job had been painful, I would not have come.
Why do you look so depressed today, your Grace?
God bless your Grace with health and happy days.
Are you my son?
I won’t until I’m ready.
You may really be honest, no matter what I think.
But where’s my fool?
I didn’t see him.
This is the air, that’s the glorious sun.
Girls, girls!
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them?
Is this my prize?
In a half an hour he’ll be asleep.
Can I have a word with you privately?
A jealous woman, a jealous woman!
Go hang yourselves, all of you!
Trebonius!
It’s noble Kent, your friend.
Here comes Lorenzo.
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles.
Good night.
Ratcliffe, come here.
Hurry, you slave!
All I have to do is remove it.
My Cesario?
Take him away!
Add details of your own to back up what I’m saying.
That’s true.
Then, if you dare to acknowledge it, I’ll take up my quarrel with you.
The fool will stay.
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours.
Yes.
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty.
What, the necklace?
Well, sir, I’ll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while.
That’s the way to show me friendship.
Oh, ho!
I think I did, sir.
I want the law, the penalty, and the fulfillment of my contract.
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month.
Now, Roderigo, where did you see her?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you saw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a father?—How did you know it was her?—To think she tricked me so easily!—What did she say to you?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives.
Claudio?
So, listen, Hermia.
I knew you’d turn out this way.
Here comes the man who rescued me, sir.
It wasn’t the journey itself, uncle, but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull.
You’ve done a good job, that other men can attribute their murders to you!
Well, I’m glad about this.
He saved me the trouble: here he comes.
You flea, you louse, you winter cricket!
Oh, I remember that very clearly!
How is my Juliet?
But Antonio’s certainly ruined.
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday, and that nothing can delay it.
You’re making a terrible racket out here!
Well, whose is it?
You’re taking a shorter route.
Talk makes him crazy.
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle.
Bring me to my host, Macbeth.
Don’t be afraid.
My father wasn’t a traitor.
May a plague curse both your families.
Wake up when something nasty is nearby.
Once again, what’s the news?
Do you like her, Claudio?
Oh no, not if you say it right.
I am still so faithful, my lord.
Call my sister that.
I’ll warm myself by blowing on the fire.
That’s where I’m going now, so I’ll leave you here.
I swear I will never break this promise of love.
Oh, help me, anyone who wants to live long!
Please lock the door and keep quiet.
And you called the fairy creature harmless, monster.
That was one hit.
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: if you can’t change something, don’t cry about it.
Where are you from?
He mixed that poison himself.
This is beyond weird.
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers.
Shall Kate be my wife?
I’m glad your father isn’t alive to see this.
Maybe he won’t see me.
In exchange, give up your claim to love Helena, since I love her and will love her until I die.
Why, my boy?
When Caesar says “do this,” it is done.
Labio and Flavio, push our armies onward.
I wish we had a signed legal contract.
I’ll bury you in a magnificent grave.
There he is at the window.
Decius, go tell them that Caesar won’t come.
Can’t you find a reason without my giving you one?
I found this pinned to my tent this morning.  
They finished their business with Pompey, and Pompey has left.
Ha, ha!
We have not yet set the coronation day.
I am his brother, and I love him very much.
Her reputation was as pure as the snow, but now it’s as dirty and black as my own face.
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak.
Leave out the water.
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats.
Show us the way.
If you are a devil, I won’t be able to kill you.
No, wait.
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood.
She can’t possibly have done you any wrong.
Then who took my letter to Romeo?
Gentlemen, let’s go make sure Cassio’s wounds are properly dressed.—Come on, ma'am, you can tell us another story.
I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones.
Now my spells are all broken, And the only power I have is my own, Which is very weak.
Oh, you’re wrong.
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go.
Are these wind instruments?
That pretty boy, Claudio?
Dreams are a sign of ambition, since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream.
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain?
One last thing, and this is up to you.
Thank you for his present and your trouble.
That’s treason!
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you.
They got what they deserved.
We age and die because they wear us out.
I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him.
But if he’s resistant and chilly, then be like that too and break off the conversation.
You’re wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles.
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune.
There’s no room for the old man and his followers.
Please be quiet.
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that.
If I decide to get angry at you, just watch out— You’d be done for then, monster.
You promised to take a full year off my sentence.
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you.
He had one yesterday.
Ah, you sorceress!
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now.
Believe me, then, that I have special powers.
What are you waiting for, lords of France?
Did you see him?
We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus!
Wait for me there.
A rebel!
Here.
Let that be enough for you.
We used to think so too.
That’s because the murderer is alive.
It doesn’t look that way to me.
It’s often the case that having something makes us spoiled, while not having it turns out to be advantageous.
I frown at him, but he still loves me.
When you were wooing Desdemona, did Michael Cassio know about it?
Oh, I’m out of breath from this foolish chase.
Honest to God, where’s the sexton?
Is he angry?
That’s how sound a man you appeared.
I’ll commute your death sentence.
Bring me face to face with Macbeth, that devil of Scotland.
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
I am at your service.
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner.
Get to the point, since we already know the truth.
I’m finished, then.
Mine wasn’t wearing a bridle.
For the love of God, help us!
Please, tell me your cure.
I know what I’m talking about.
But please tell me, sir, is your marriage  Let him do his worst.
And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave.
Yes—as you and the rest will find out as soon as he’s home.
Do you have unusual snakes there?
Oh, where’s Romeo?
I’ve brought him a present.
Come on, put it away.
They have wings.
Are you going to write Antony about this?
You’re right.
What did you do that for?
I will.
It was just an accident!
No, you’ll have to excuse me.
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose.
Whatever else happens tonight, I hope the king escapes safely!
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves, and I will be king for my entire natural life.
Until then, we’ve said enough. 
Hurry.
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it.
I knew him when he would’ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket.
I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight.
Seriously, I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa, when we attended the marriage of the king’s daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
With the handicap they’ve given me, I think I’ll win.
Oh, come on now, Kate.
You’d be the funniest person in Illyria… if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking.
I do.
Where have you been, boy?
Tell us, Bottom.
Go to the platform, Brutus.
No.
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice.
You’re famous for it.
Risk everything for lead?
But there was a rumor—you know, people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia.
I didn’t.
If he’s been killed, say “Yes.” If not, say “No.” These short words will determine my joy or my pain.
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me, especially when I’m slaving away busily.
But tell me, monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing?
This is a miracle, if you talk of miracles.
Who are you?
I won’t.
Out, out, brief candle.
He’s pretty awful in the morning when he’s sobering up, and even worse in the afternoon when he’s drunk.
No woman’s heart is big enough to hold all my love.
Well, Petruchio, all this is very encouraging.
Give me what I deserve, and do your duty!
I swear to God it’s true, sir.
Sir, sir, sir—
Has he, sirs?
People don’t cry when they’re mocking someone. 
With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death.
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools.
But let’s shake hands, Menas.
Have you seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?
When you begged to stay, that was the time for words.
Quiet, quiet!
Master, should I watch the door?
I need to hear the truth about all this.
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet’s traditional feast, along with every beautiful woman in Verona.
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio.
Good Portia, go to bed.
Come and get it!
When this wood burns, it’ll weep for making you tired.
If grief doesn’t kill me, I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself—even though I think grief will do the job just as well.
Go find him.
With a hand like this you need to
Believe me, King of Illusions, I made a mistake.
Is he losing his mind?
Then you are damned.
You, my slave, were her servant at the time, as you admit yourself.
Come with me, and let’s smother my fiendish son—who smothered your two sweet sons—in bitter words.
Well then, your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived.
A friend would never see those faults.
That’s really news!
There’s my dagger  Put away your dagger.
I don’t deny it.
My God, it’s nauseating!
But how?
I will, as surely as I am a gentleman.
Look, here are the boxes, prince.
That’s another bad deal I’ve made!—a bankrupt, a spendthrift, who now has to hide his head on the Rialto, a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants.
But how is it possible that Prospero’s alive and well and living on this island?  
For lawyers on vacation, because they sleep their holidays away, with no sense of how time moves.
I don’t think he’d have any choice, my lord.
You mean the sun!
Who’s that?
You mean a devil!
My lord, what I say may be a little confused, since I’m half asleep and half awake.
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night.
A crazy bastard.
Do you have the lion’s part written down?
Be patient, I’m telling you.
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child.
Let go of my hand.
I have to stop you, Cimber.
Oh, it is my love.
Please, give my regards to your mother, Mrs. Peapod, and your father, Mr. Peapod.
Your wife and brother led troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name.
For the enemy, see—and you can explain this to the duke, see—has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours.
Can he deny it?
I never saw you before in my life.
If we look like musicians to you, you can expect to hear nothing but noise.
Let me see your eyes.
I’m done for in this world, I believe.
And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion?
How?
We’ll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors' houses on fire.
And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy.
Antonio and Shylock, both of you come forward.
Will it never be morning?
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet.
So now Sweno, the Norwegian king, wants a treaty.
All women would be angry with you for doing it, even though I’m the only one who’s hurt by it.
Oh!
If you don’t like him you should quit.
We’ve all been duped.
It has no fighting spirit.
By God, I am not selfish when it comes to money: I don’t care who eats at my expense.
Stay near me so I’ll remember.
Say, uncle Richard, if my brother comes, where will I stay till my coronation?
This means we’re having some mischievous fun.
We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up.
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace, that they seek authority, supremacy, and power when they are under an obligation to serve, love, and obey.
Sirs, take up the corpse.
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him.
I’ll be off before you are.
Nobody’s coming?
I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman.
You don’t have a man’s courage.
Otherwise, you’d see me blushing about the things you’ve heard me say tonight.
She’s still at the monastery, kneeling and praying for a happy marriage.
Well, I think that even if it weren’t on record, the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next—all the way to Doomsday.
I’m even happier that I’m not stupid, and I can learn.
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity.
Who are you talking to?
She’s only sad when she sleeps—and not even then.
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately.
But if it’s not double-dealing, sir, I wish you’d deal me another.
Let’s get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall.
Judge for yourself.
Cleopatra summoned him.
Yes.
Keep your word.
Many people, men and women alike.
I can’t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way.
I don’t want to take another man’s second-hand goods.
With his ambition growing like this—do you hear what I’m saying?
That’s him, madam.
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine.
Do you know him?
Have you both really given me up?
I’m being gentle with you, because I’m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself.
Good morning, my noble lord.
It’s over here.
As I sat on the shore crying over my father’s shipwreck, I heard the music creep over the wild waves, calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies.
Hello, Cassio!
If he were dead, you’d be weeping for him.
No, don’t cry, kind Eros.
But here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city.
But his ambition—for that, I killed him.
But this is a sure thing: the snake’s an odd snake.
Take out your sword and come on.
No, I swear on my honor, I haven’t, madam.
We’re lucky that Rome is rid of him.
Look, my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him.
How are you, Guildenstern?
It will likely be a bloody fight.
Once I’ve put my rackets to these balls, I’ll play a set in France, God willing, that will knock his father’s crown right out of the court.
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked, which is as bad as being killed by tickling.
I don’t have the thing that makes time fly.
Oh, teach me how you look the way you do, and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you.
But as for this ring, please excuse me.
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury.
He was wrong to do that.
I don’t believe it.
Oh my Christian ducats!
I’m no more insane than you are, and I’ll prove it.
If we happen to offend you, it’s because we want to.
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel.
His life was gentle, and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world, “This was a man.” Let’s treat him according to his virtue, with all the respect and rituals of burial.
I’m begging you, good Mercutio, let’s call it a day.
I’ll have no halves.
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked.
For you to do it would be good service.
Here’s the indictment of the good Lord Hastings, which has been written out in a clear hand, like any legal document, so it can be read aloud in public outside St. Paul’s Cathedral.
Why is the Jew waiting?
Give me my robe.
Hail!
Don’t reply.
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is.
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails.
I want you to see the difference between us, so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon.
Don’t be afraid.
Yes, like your horse, who, staggering under your boasts, would trot more easily if some of them dismounted.
I’ll write to my sister and tell her my plans.
Aren’t I your Rosalind?
Let’s see.
Please go on.
My story does raise that question.
Show it!
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life.
Liberty!
Welcome, my lord.
What do you want?
What?
You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak.
My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing.
Come, I’ll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns.
He’s dressed like a freak, a total freak, and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman’s valet.
I won’t bet on whether or not any of this is real.
I swear to you, I don’t want to be doing this.
Come on in, tailor.
Now, Signior Petruchio, how are you getting on with my daughter?
I’m glad Casca is with us.
So give me your answer, and we’ll shake on it.
Did you call, my lord?
If you think about it correctly, Caesar has suffered a great wrong.
Coward!
Please spare my innocent wife and children!—Kind warden, please stay with me for a while.
I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it.
Make Cassio angry somehow, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else you want.
Fight to the death” is his motto.
I’ll let you know right away how it’s going.
What a poor, gullible monster.—That was a nice big gulp, monster!
You absolute villain!
Fake, I’m telling you.
And as you said (and you said it wisely), it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them, since she can be too partial to him.
Look, I don’t love you, so stop following me around.
Why are you enraged?
So, goodbye.
Don’t tempt me to suicide again.
Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead.
What did they do wrong?
He won’t have a chance.
You’re going to make me jealous, Launcelot, if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this!
Shake off sleep, which looks like death, and look at death itself!
He sees himself in my two eyes, so there’s two of him.
Well, what do you guess?
Still the same old Cassius!
Can we finish our lunch?
Answer me that first.
While we’re talking here, a royal battle could be won and lost.
What is a traitor?
Oh, yes, Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever.  
Prepare yourselves, generals.
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant.
Don’t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces.
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that.
Yes, by God!
My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
I’ve got my answer.
Or I’ll deliver your insults to his face.
Why, she’s inside.
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money.
Here, take this piece of jewelry.
Conspiracies, fakery, betrayal, and disorder are all that’s left until we die.
Go.
Very well.
Men who risk everything hope to make profits.
Fine, but not enough.
How do you know he loves her?
It’s a wonder you didn’t lose your life and your mind all at once.—He’s waking up.
Take him away.
Is Claudio your enemy?
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing?—Come on, sister, you can be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
Who, me, my lord?
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm, you would’ve told your doorman to let them in, despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world.
I swear, I think my wife’s faithful, and I think she’s not.
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him.
Be brave like the lion and proud.
What are you thinking?
If you cut both their throats, then you are the absolute best.
It was incredible!
What did he do that made him flee this land?
Our regiments are full to the brim; our cause is ready.
But tell me, how is your cousin?
Her reputation is also her own.
So, what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company?
Nurse?
Sir, the person who should sing that song isn’t here.
We all expect a nice answer from you, Jew.
I’ll answer for you.
Why are you yelling at me so angrily?
Sir, I tell you we believe you’re both lying criminals.
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil!
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland?
So you’ll go to hell?
Oliver, your brother—no, not your brother; and yet he’s the son—but no, I won’t call him the son—of that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down, with you in it.
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover?
I did them for Edward’s sake—and look how he rewards me.—Oh God, if my prayers don’t satisfy you, and you have to avenge the wrongs I’ve done, at least punish me alone!
Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger.
A sword’s too heavy for you to wear.
The old priest at Saint Luke’s Church is at your command at all hours.
This is a good agreement.
I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker.
I met the young man at Lawrence’s cell.
Tomorrow, soldier, I’ll fight by sea and land.
All right, now I’m starting to lose my cool.
Who?
And how do you like Lord Bassanio’s wife?
I don’t know about that.
I had no idea she was cheating on me.
You’ll be afraid to hear it.
I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word.
The gods can hear you lying!
Day and night, hour after hour, all the time, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority has always been to find her a husband.
Do you really mean that?
I’m asking you to understand my point of view.
Oh, Cassius, if you could only convince Brutus to join us— Don’t worry.
Yes, sir.
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king.
I know I will too, if it’s the last thing I do.
What do you mean, “in a strange way”?
Oh, noble prince, I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight.
My lord, I won’t miss it.
Aren’t things going well?
Good Mr. Peaseblossom, I’d like to get to know you better too.—And you, may I ask what your name is, sir?
She didn’t ask anything?
Hide yourself, good Romeo.
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial, as I have more reason to mourn than you do.
You’ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty, and yet you, the murderer, look as bright and clear as a star in the sky.
The Lord Mayor is knocking.
You killed my child.
Look, Lucius, here’s the book I was searching for.
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks, torches in their hands.
So I  Your Honor’s actors, hearing of your recovery, have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you—and your doctors approve wholeheartedly.
And here he comes, puffing himself up like a turkey.
Amen to that, lady.
You have guessed exactly what I feared.
Here comes Sir Oliver.
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy, arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was—my trust which had no limit, an infinite confidence.
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons.
Ah, my good old friends!
The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir.
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing, because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe.
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough.
Now I’m afraid we’ve lost your son forever.
You think my uncle was lying, grandmother?
Oh Lord, my spirits are tired!
Listen, hussy—is this man one of your customers?
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought?
This is good.
Oh, you mighty gods! 
I’d send seven of my servants to go get him.
Oh, sir, someone would think I was a good fake.
For Hecuba!
By our Lady, I think that’s true.
Wasn’t he born from a woman?
Will you cry about your cousin’s death forever?
Go inside, Nerissa.
We’ll take you there.
No, I won’t.
It’s incredible—they didn’t say a word.
I’ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face.
He’s gone, and his wife’s dead.
If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe.
Oh, God help me!
A  What’s going on?
Now, tailor, let’s see what you’ve got.
Good luck, sir.
There’s no one else here.
Inside the little rind of this weak flower, there is both poison and powerful medicine.
I’ll go get them, sir.  
The world is a bad place, where you can’t speak what you know.
The king’s in bed.
That means it’s more likely to be fake.
It doesn’t matter where, so long as it’s not here.
But, oh no!
No, not him, though his face is more handsome than any man’s, and his legs are prettier, and as for his hands and feet and body, they’re not much to speak of, and yet they’re beyond compare.
I’m an ass, I’m a woman’s servant, and I’m beside myself.
At that exact moment, Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him, an ass.
I think he really is angry.
I’m afraid you’ll come to me again for ransom.
I’ll speak to them, and then tonight I’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds.
Are you planning to go out?
I don’t like that.
Officer, I’ll take the responsibility from you, and the blame too.
Hello to you too, sir.
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting a man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end.
Lead the way, sir.
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead.
Damn him!
Please tell me.
Shame of what, lady?
Your servants were fighting your enemy’s servants before I got here.
You knew that my sword, weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what. 
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory.
Don’t worry, I’ll be there.
Can a man do it?
Be lenient, dearest!
Look, here’s the necklace.
Good morning, sir.
Toward Chertsey, noble lord?
Shall we get to work?
Why the nobles were imprisoned, and on what charges, I don’t know, my gracious lord.
It’s a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please.
Then you’re a better man than the king.
He’s awfully proud, but his pride suits him.
How can Caesar be a tyrant then?
I had you figured for a piece of furniture.
Oh, hello, father!
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders.
Dromio, tell the servants to prepare for lunch.
And he did.
I leave him in your care—but oh, if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him.
They plan to spend the night in Sardis.
Why, what’s the matter?
Oh, what a villain!
When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper.
Here comes another Jew.
You’ll hear more from me by midnight.
I wish my father could see them with my eyes.
I will do more, though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime, asking for pardon.
Then leave her, sir.
Well, Susan died and is with God.
Come, ask me to do anything for you.
The war’s over and the Turks are drowned.
We’ll meet again at nine in the morning.
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began, “Wonder of nature—” I have heard a sonnet to one’s mistress that began like that.
I told him you were sick.
Count how many times the clock chimes.
Now, madam, undress and come to bed.
Well, well.
Can God be so jealous and hateful?
As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon.
The tragic actors from the city, the ones you used to enjoy so much.
Oh, sun, I will never see another one of your sunrises.
I can be discreet in honorable matters, ride a horse, run, tell a good story badly, and deliver a plain message bluntly.
Orsino, this is the same Antonio who took the 
Who, me?
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him.
Come on, bring them in.
Have I hugged you yet?
Go to the church.
I will walk around and mingle with all of you, playing the humble host.
But where will I lie tomorrow?
Oh life!
What’s going on, my lord?
Young man, have you challenged Charles the Wrestler?
More, please, more.
It is.
I obey all your thoughts.
The person who suffers alone suffers the most.
The other girl did not love me.
There’s other work for you to do.
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice.
If only that were all it is— It is, I promise.
Do you think I’d break my oath?
Why are you so pale?
Why, here is the order to prove it.
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you.
God be with you all.
Please forgive me if I’m mistaken, my lord—but I can’t keep quiet when I think you’re being insulted.
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours, when they plummet, they plummet that much farther.
I don’t have any news to report, my lord.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady.
Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here.
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true.
Give me your hand.
I haven’t seen such a promising candidate for your love.
It’s much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one.
Why do you keep repeating that, woman?
And that’s what you want me to do!
No harm was done.
I’m sending you to England on diplomatic business, and Hamlet will go with you.
He rushed away on serious business.
Should we watch this ridiculous scene?
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message?
Run, run, oh, run!
I’m Christopher Sly, son of old Sly of Barton-on-Heath, a peddler by birth, a  Oh, this is why your poor wife is mourning!
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated.
Even good men have bad luck.
Sneaky, dried-up old coot!
Niece, will you take care of those things I mentioned?
A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them.
Cassio’s a good friend of mine—My lord, I can see you’re upset.
That’s true, my lord: I did get this ring from her.
I doubt it, since you weren’t even three at the time.
Please, my lady, just confirm that you’re the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech.
It’s his fault that he’s all worked up like this.
I did.
Give me a torch.
Yes, my lord.
More shouting!
Look at them.
You think she gave it to Cassio?
But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far, because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, I’ll keep going.
She picks it up quick, doesn’t she?
Be my witness, oh you blessed moon.
I flashed about faster than lightning.
I hear my father coming.
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once, when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear.
The world’s gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments.
Where is my Romeo?
Tell me what it’s about.
But it’d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible.
Well, the tree bears rotten fruit.
The man should be inside the lantern.
If what you feel is really love, tell me how much.
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling?
What kind of loyalty is this?
He would never have spoken to me like this.
No, he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old.
What, you?
Oh, if you only knew how close to success you are, even while you make fun of what I’m telling you!
Oh, noble Caesar!
Damn my suspicious thoughts!
That’s all he asks for himself.
Yes, hand me one too.
Is he still alive?
The moment they planned to act is almost here.
Aren’t the others waiting for me, Cinna?
Let’s all sink with the king.
My beautiful warrior!
Go play with yourself.
I’ll give you mine.
Ah, how will this all turn out?
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come, and, on her knee, she begged me to stay home today.
Does that mean he’s lazy?
The royal tree has left us other fruit, which, with time, will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king, I’m sure.
Let’s talk.
What did I keep for myself?
Is it good or bad?
Was he sad or happy?
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy, I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence.
But in fact it doesn’t say much.
If there is, then heaven help him!
Ah, here comes my messenger.—What’s going on, you crazy spirit?
What’s wrong with you?
See how well she can turn?
And some have greatness thrust upon them.” Heaven help you!
Prepare your troops.
But come, lords, will you come with me to Edward’s room to comfort him?
Call him in.
Follow me, then.
My gracious king.
We have God and a good cause on our side.
By Jesus, I am your Majesty’s countryman, and I don’t care who knows it.
He should imprison the person who named you, instead.
Don’t say anything else.
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything.
March to the bridge.
You can’t stay here any longer.
Yes, with Cassio.
So be it.
Your sister’s the better soldier of the two.
My name is Petruchio, son of Antonio, a man well known throughout Italy.
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar, and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination.
He’s somewhere else in the house.
Oh, monster, we know secondhand clothes when we see them.— Take off that gown, Trinculo.
Then let God grant me that you’ll be damned for that wicked deed.
Say goodbye to your sisters.
My sweet Cassio!
Not the time I saw it.
I’ll do everything I can for you, Cassio.
Give me my veil.
You told me they escaped into this forest.
You stopped me.
You.
If you aren’t weeping, it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have a new father.
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize.
I guess now she’s going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife.
Have more than you show, Speak less than you know, Lend less than you owe.
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer, and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse.
When should the royal day be?
Give a quick example.
Yes, a thousand times.
Come here, herald.—Let the trumpet sound!—Read this out.
This news is absolutely true: Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now.
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved.
I’ve made my choice.
Please go away, both of you.
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit, but who cares?
You would run away from a bear, but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean, you’d turn around and confront the bear.
Come, warble for me.
I beg the court to deliver the verdict.
Well, lead on.
Never, Iago.
Take Cupid’s wings and fly higher than the average man.
But we haven’t made any preparations.
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running.
My dear clever Ariel, listen carefully.
He was my brother’s son!
Don’t talk to me, Emilia.
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl.
I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.
Yes, he knew about it the whole time.
No wonder she’s waiting to get married.
No, not for all of Venice.
No, not at all— All right, all right.
You just said they had to face her.
It’s time to end it, good lady.
That rotten scoundrel! 
Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me.
Your wife, Fulvia, is dead.
Yes, and it seemed twice as long to me, having been kept from your bed that whole time.
He’s definitely the most active gentleman of France.
He’s nearby, and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master.
Well then, here’s more money for you.
Sebastian was my father’s name, and my brother was named Sebastian too.
Ah, my poor princes!
Strangle her in her bed, the same bed she’s contaminated.
Your Majesty, see here—if it won’t offend your Grace—what a complete, rascally, beggarly, lousy rat this is.
I’m backed into a corner with nowhere to run.
I am not a child or an infant.
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries.
Not one, my lord.
Come here, boy.
A man with a wife like that might ask, “Hey, wandering wit, where are you off to?” Nah, better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed.
Tell him my fury will abate, and I’ll take the crowns.
Lend me your handkerchief.
Lysander and I are running away from here.
Gracious Lord, blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again!
It’s true I heard a humming sound, a strange one, which woke me up.
Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil.
Oh wicked wall, through which I don’t see any happiness!
What, isn’t my mother coming?
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples.
Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends, I’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance, grateful for both good and bad.
Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you?
Cesario, you missed your appointment with me.
Damn it, show me what you’re going to do for her.
It was a rough night.
Hey, you!
That will happen before sunset.
It’s a letter from my brother that I haven’t finished reading yet.
Today’s a holiday, so the beggar’s shop is shut.
Or should I say it’s her uncle?
Is the army without a leader?
I can’t stand her.
So be it, Dolabella.
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself.
Why, you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman.
It’s a sweet lozenge that you choke on.
If she rants, I’ll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
Go, lad, and take them to the pantry.
But first I’ll release the fairy queen from the spell.
I don’t know what to think about this.
Be a careful mother, madam, and think about your son, the young prince.
Too quickly, we boarded a ship.
My trusty servant, Ariel!
Is it “chaste in word and action”?
But I promise you, Kate: the older I grow the better I’ll look.
What if she’s pretty but stupid?
Good lady, don’t be angry with the child.
Shush, sir, please!
But you have all the advantages from the harm done.
I wish it were day!
When fools cry, you remain stony.
That’s why it’s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues, like I do.
Kent’s been banished just like that?
He’s afraid to come in.
This speech is going on too long.
What would you like to see?
I’m not going to waste any more time with you.
If it’s true that you don’t need 
You say he’s friendly with Caesar, healthy, and free.
Welcome back from Mantua.
And you’ll speak on the same platform as I do, after I’m done.
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me.” Oh, how monstrously evil!
Good-bye, noble Agrippa.
May a plague strike both your families!
You are not as happy as Macbeth, yet much happier.
None of us.
When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you.
For what favor?
My Italy is full of civil war.
My lord, we were sent for.
Why, he told me so himself, and he said he didn’t care who knew it.
Meanwhile, after you.
You annoying idiot, what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me?
Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table.
See how he stands between two clergymen!
If there are any, speak, for it is he whom I’ve offended.
Hurry up, Audrey, hurry.—I’m coming, I’m coming.
Juliet lies here, and her beauty fills this tomb with light.
It has caused the downfall of many kings.
Where are they?
Tell me what I want to know.
Soon enough.
Yes, it’s Emilia.
Good.
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way, and Cassio couldn’t let it pass.
That’ll be fine.
You told me to do the same, my liege.
So that means she’ll come.
It’s not safe to go near them till we get more help.
But all of you, remember what you’ve said and prove yourselves true Romans.
What’s this, my lord?
Is it possible to be wise, bewildered, calm, furious, loyal, and neutral all at once?
This island contains everything beneficial to life.
Oh, are you going to leave me so unsatisfied?
We are free from his tyranny.
My lord, my lord— I don’t want to hear any more about it.
No?
Tell us, old Egeon: are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia, who gave birth to two fair sons?
You’re my true and honorable wife, as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart.
There’s no place I’d rather die than here by Caesar, and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you, the masters of this new era.
And keep yourself hidden, I command you.
Oh!
Alright, I will.
Stay warm.
I want to be friends with you, and forget all the times you’ve embarrassed and humiliated me.
So let’s see it.
I know how  Too light for a lout like you to catch—though no lighter than I should be.
How did you know what happened to your poor father?
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions.
They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up.
Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case.
I will go straight to visit him.
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you, ex-daughter of mine.
Herald, spare yourself.
And I beg you, please come here again tomorrow.
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind.
How many people who are humble now would be great then?
We need more help!
Damn it, this isn’t funny.
Murder!
Let it all go.
Goodbye to my happiness!
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous.
If you’re Trinculo, then come out.
Oh, he’s a lovely gentleman!
Are you an actor?
It may be honest, but it’s never wise to bring bad news.
Bathe his filthy head with warm, scented water.
How is my noble lord?
I’ll be gentle and mild.
Are you educated?
If you took a good look at yourself, or if you thought about this more carefully, your fear would teach you to act more cautiously.
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts.
I swear I never hated you or your father!
But sir, have you married my daughter without my consent?
What can I tell you?
It wouldn’t surprise me, my lord.
Come with me, boy.
Because he’s so young, I’ve tried to discourage him, but he won’t listen.
We won’t go today—or any day until it’s clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is.  
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin.
I’ve done a bad thing, for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy again.
You there, rogue, what do you have to say about that?
Until then, I’ll walk around town, peruse the markets, and gaze upon the buildings, and then I’ll return and sleep at the inn.
Well, then, we’re awake.
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea, breasting the high waves.
I put my trust in you.
They won’t pinch me, frighten me, push me in the mud, or mislead me unless he tells them to.
Young boy, I wish I could make you believe that I’m in love.
Well sir, good night.
If I took the kingdom from your sons, I’ll give it to your daughter to make up for it.
Let’s hear what Antony has to say.
No, listen to it, Antony.
No, we can just announce the actor’s name, and let his face show through the lion costume, and have him say something himself.
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about.
Yes, my good lord.
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss!
As far as I know, sir.
Stop fooling around.
No–the law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse’s marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself.
You’ve wronged Caius Ligarius.
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own.
Good to see you, Master Antipholus.
And he challenged you to a duel?
And do you mean what you’re saying, Gratiano?
You are welcome here, as are all of you English princes.
God in heaven bless her!
Welcome, welcome to all of you.
He’s an admirable man.
I’m glad to see you in such a merry mood.
Shame on you!
Shall we get started?
And time itself is ended.
Yes, my lord.
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say.
Round enough to be unattractive.
Well then, improve your situation with a show of courage.
Have Montjoy hurry, then, Lord Constable, and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war.
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job.
Look, he’s recovering.
Watch her.
He mustn’t go to prison.
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum.
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero; this girl is heir to both our estates.
It sets you up for a fall.
You’re brave gentlemen.
The news is true, my lord.
Here comes Oberon.
Draw the curtains, just like that.
Now I see that you can’t call anything good except in right context.
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest.
Shall I put it plainly?
I know all of this.
The rain, the wind, the thunder and lightning are not my daughters.
Let’s embrace 
Nothing is what it is.
Cheer up as much as you can.
Your lives are over.
Cassio, how did you get my wife’s handkerchief?
I must tell you then.
No, I don’t—except as a friend.
It seems to me like we’re still sleeping, still dreaming.
I’ll go to Ireland.
Then learn this from me: if you have something, you have it.
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want to hear.
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger.
Charles did the same to the second brother, and the third.
Get lost!
If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases, and that’s his business.
What a pain.
Madam, I will.
The law fully authorizes the penalty, which you have to pay according to the contract.
Good night.
Remind Richard of this, and he will weep.
There’s magic in its fabric.
You shouldn’t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father.
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army.
Adieu.
Who’s calling me?
The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English.
No, you have to swear it.
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant?
If you ever loved your poor dear father— Oh God!
I hope God makes you happy again, like you once were.
This one?
Ah, my lord, this prince is nothing like Edward!
Your friend,      Artemidorus.” I’ll stand here until Caesar passes by, and I’ll give him this as though it’s a petition.
Carry your master out.
Shame on you!
Well then, I know who you are.
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth.
Yes, but that makes me love you even more.
Villains, you didn’t do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar’s sides.
What’s the matter?
I pitied you, worked hard to teach you to speak, and taught you some new thing practically every hour.
I need to get away from you.
She’s very moral.
What my lord said I was.
If we don’t, it’ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives.
If they see you, they’ll murder you.
Shut up, you troublemaker, no more of that.
We’re unprepared for this wedding celebration.
Good morning to you.
I had to send it to him.
I could have sworn he trampled on me.
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him.
For instance, our husbands
Quiet!
This way, my lord.
We have a little dessert coming up. 
Good night to you.
You’re making fun of me.
Come, help me bang on the door, master.
You bastard workhorse drudge!
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; Sir Gilbert Talbot; Sir William Stanley; Oxford; the highly feared Pembroke; Sir James Blunt; Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew; and many other famous and powerful noblemen.
Put on a happy face, and welcome your friends.
His knights are getting out of control, and he himself reprimands us about every little detail.
If you can love me for this, take me.
There, Diomedes, there.
Fair enough.
You killed this king, didn’t you?
If they have spoken the truth about Hero, I will tear her apart with my bare hands.
Don’t be silly!
I’m suddenly afraid.
What shall I do?
Don’t run away—stay where you are.
Are you all good and honest men?
I’ll kiss your hand, and with that I leave you.
I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now.
I have no power over you.
Now start the music, and sing the solemn hymn.
But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble.
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully, if it made your life easier.
If I can’t have an estate by birthright, then I’ll get it by being clever.
When he’s there next time, I’ll send my daughter to see him.
Good sir—
That’s what I said when I first conjured the tempest.
Keep your promise, my love.
Look, she’s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers.
I’m just wandering, with no particular destination.
I believe it completely.
If he loves Caesar, then he can only hurt himself—by grieving and dying for Caesar.
Tyranny is dead!
Thank you, sir.
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food!
I want you.
He’s a good man.
There must be a strange explanation for this—if it’s true.
Help, dear lord, or the battle will be lost!
I know a thousand immature tricks like that, and I’ll use them all.
Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors, which they are going to grow up and become?
Answer me.
Are you afraid to act the way you desire?
Call me when it’s lit.
Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that?
Don’t do this!
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother.
You’ve got something for me?
No, son.
You’re    Pull out your tool now.
A house, a person?
I’ll see her like this.
I can’t say “whore.” It makes me sick to say the word even now.
But don’t I have good reason to cry?
I’m telling you the truth.
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion!
Why, what’s the danger?
Like hell she is!
Thieves!
Where are you, Death?
If you’ve been ordered back to Venice because of my father, don’t blame me.
No.
It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me.
We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight.
Oh, the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress?
In my desperate situation, I have to act alone.
Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.
And there’s a messenger representing a fifth one, the prince of Morocco, who says the prince will be here tonight.
Tell me.
Let’s not, Brutus.
Go, get out of here.
God help you, foolish man.
You take the bill and I’ll take your yardstick.
Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more.
How can they refuse to speak with me?
No, he has only a little beard.
Here’s a sick man who wants to speak with you.
Where did you hear this?
Suffer love!
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
I sent the French queen with him too, for the same reason.
Oh, I’d never be that cruel.
When he stands where I am and sees you there.  
You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that, sir.
That was nothing.
This story breaks my heart.
What’s this?
What, in my presence?
It would be inappropriate—dangerous, even—for me to be seen working against the Moor, as I would if I stayed.
Put
How can I help you?
Did you see the king today, Lord Derby?
What’s new, cousin Lodovico?
Come over here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again.
It was.
Is the duke of Exeter safe?
And let no one suffer for this deed except us, the perpetrators.
Were you here when it started?
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors.
Not really, unless you were ugly.
Oh nature, what were you doing in hell?
But what’s your trade?
And when has he ever been known to wash his face?
My lord, they’re waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio.
Madam, I’m a bit like you in that I can’t tolerate a tone of disapproval.
Stop Harry of England, who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur.
No, he loves and cherishes me.
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you, if I were a woman.
I wonder if the lion’s going to talk.
It’s a messenger from the warships.
Indeed, you have wronged me, you liar.
What do you want me to do with this?
The fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens.
What’s the matter?
What would that be?
It’s not earlier than that, I tell you.
No, follow him now, before he divulges the prank and ruins everything.
No, I’ll walk right next to you, side by side.
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand.
Oh luck, luck.
Two of my brother’s men, all tied up!
Who’d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird?
Oh, oh, oh!
She’s wise, if I’m judging her right.
You who are wicked beyond belief, the only “explanation” I’ll accept from you is for you to hang yourself.
Good night.
If any of my relatives find you here they’ll kill you because of who you are.
And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid, which is bad for my complexion.
They’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother.
Will you have dinner with me tonight, Casca?
I can’t make myself a man by wishing I were, so as a woman I’ll die, from grieving.
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I, though they don’t cry for Edward, as I do.
What are you doing, old man?
I humbly thank you.
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.” So get out of here, disloyal thanes, and join the weak and decadent English!
Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor.
Hey monster, the spirit you’ve been talking about, the one you call harmless, has been playing tricks on us.
To supper?
He’s honest, he’s got to speak the truth.
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse.
I, Wall, have done my part.
I make the laws, not you.
I have nothing to say to you.
Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind.
He turned away twice and almost left him there.
Well, don’t face off with me.
I would choose to take my penalty.
No, not me, sir.
Your husband knew about everything.
To kill the boys with the luggage!
Venus went home again, and her little son broke all his arrows, swearing he’ll never shoot them again, but play with birds like other little boys.
You’re not thinking of leaving tonight, surely?
Now that you speak of paper, I remember a funny story of Hero’s.
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit.
What are you going to do for her?
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage.
Master, if you eat with her, bring really long silverware.
All right, we’ll have a prologue then.
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift?
Me, uncle?
That’s how things should be—straight and smooth.
Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight.
Listen to our horses neighing, longing to be working.
It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but bear with me.
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman.
I’ll fight you.
But you’re a famous pirate!
She has royal blood.
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome.
Oh, my lord, you once said that lazy weeds grow fast.
Give me my armor.
You always slip out of the argument like this.
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king.
Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs.
Oh, it’s as easy as lying.
I don’t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is.
He speaks well.
It’s true I’m not married, Caesar.
Here, madam:     Translate.
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court?
What’s the boy Malcolm?
Everything you told me I already knew.
Well, we can put away our pipes and go home.
I can’t live by pretending anymore.
The Venetians are waiting for their food.
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.
We must remember the gravity of this sad day.
Well, that proves she’s in love with you.
You’re a bitter fool.
Did he cry?
Cicero too?
Romeo!
Here she comes, the brilliant fool-catcher.
The sun will not appear today.
Well there, now you’ve said it.
How goes it, friend Eros?
Let’s go!
The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors.
Brutus, may I have a word with you?   
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant?
Pardon us, dear father.
Oh, I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek.
Continue, then, and don’t forget to perform all of the rituals.
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles.
And because you interrupt us so that we can’t dance for them, the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood, just to get revenge on you.
What, are you mocking me to my face?
Nobody but the fool, who’s trying to soothe the wounds in the king’s heart with jokes.
I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous  I wouldn’t change my situation for anything.
I’ve sent for him.
That’s  Signior Baptista, will you really be this cruel?
Wait just a minute, you brazen hussy.
No, a flatterer wouldn’t, even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus.
Murderer!
Wake up my whole household!
Please go inside.
Oh, then I guess she was old and gentle, and you rode barelegged, like an Irish yokel.
You asked for justice, so rest assured you’ll get more justice than you bargained for.
You barely have the heart to tell me, so you can’t possibly have the nerve to do it.
Clarence is still alive; Edward is not only alive, he’s king.
Please, my lord, don’t be friendly with her.
I’ll be a harsh master to them.
Who’s there?
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead.
I bet it will.
Take out your sword.
You don’t know a thing!
And if it doesn’t go well, then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery, the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation—away from the public’s eyes, tongues, mind, and insults.
May God, who is the best matchmaker, join your hearts and realms in one.
I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey.
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on.
The answer, my dear, is that they didn’t dare, because the people of Milan loved me too much.
Very good!
He’s like a cowardly 
Tell me, Captain Macmorris, have you left the tunnels?
Thank you for saying that.
Weren’t you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night, right after he’d raped her?
That must be because you’re so ambitious.
Don’t listen to the bell, Duncan, because it summons you either to heaven or to hell.
And you, go call my fool.
I invite you all aboard my ship.
Why, dear child?
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time.
Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony.
Set him free.
And then his clerk, who went to a lot of trouble with the writing, begged for mine.
You’re a well-dressed lady.
I’ll be back soon to wake up your generosity.
So give me my nightgown, Emilia, and I’ll say goodnight.
That was my turquoise ring!
No, no.
Oh, Mother Nature, why did you create lions?
The duke will agree with me on that.
Oh, what a relief!
Good Hermia, please don’t act so bitter toward me.
Get over it.
The sky shows countless stars.
You were born from a woman.
You call this sneering?
The only thing you can sense are punches—just like an ass.
Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear.
You too.
My God, this is unbelievably strange.
No, I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick.
May God bring you sleep!
Yes, that’s the one.
Let him come forward.
Tie him to this chair.—You’ll see, criminal— By the gods, it’s disgraceful for you to pull my beard.
Go on, tell it.
That’s better than exaggerating our trust.
You don’t know me.
It’s Orlando, who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant.
Affection!” That’s nothing!
I have no opinion about him.
He has killed me, Mother.
If you want to watch, follow me.
And then throw the seeds in the sea, to make more islands grow.
I’m the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates.
Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit.
Yes, my lord, if you give us permission.
The testament!
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements?
Richard loves neither me nor any of you.
I didn’t say anything.
Some startling news has just arrived, sir.
Now sit down, everybody, and rehearse your parts—Pyramus, you start.
Don’t swear at all.
Here he comes.
But despite all this, your daughters will give you a lot of money—or do I mean pain?—in the coming year.
I’m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced.
Isn’t he here?
With who?
You’re a villain to say this about me.
I did too, and he also swore he would marry her tonight.
How are you, Charmian?
Goodbye.
Oh cousin, cousin!
You’ve only insulted yourself.
These are a man’s words, and his handwriting.
A jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog.
I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost.
Get yourself to a convent, at once.
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep.
Wait, Tybalt, wait!
A second Daniel!—A Daniel, Jew!
It will be to your advantage, because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest.
I hope so too, Madam.
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people.
I meant a crowbar.
My lord, I have news for you.
She’s not going to borrow money from them.
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money.
Amen.
I’ll pick berries for you.
Ah well, my Kate.
Or ask you to leave the room?
Where are these murderers?
I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad—and to travel for all that trouble, no less!
Can you bring me to him?
I’m not in a joking mood.
Give me your hand, Leonato.
Or, if you don’t delay, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.
Oh, this is a painful time!
I’m sorry, my friend.
Who’s blocking the way?
Worthy sir, greetings!
We can’t wait here.
If you’re Launcelot, then you’re my own flesh and blood.
Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood.
Oh, sin can disguise itself so artfully!
My darling Othello!
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond, and Buckingham, backed by a hardy Welsh army, is on the march.
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that!
Call it a match!
Can she give that away too?
Your worst fault is being in love.
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs.” Crisscrossed?
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter?
Oh!
Goodbye, my Desdemona.
But if the cause is not just, the king himself will have a lot to answer for, when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying, “We died at such and such a place.” Some will be swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some for the wives that are destitute without them, some about the debts they owed, some for their children left unprovided for.
I will, Caesar.
My heart’s as black as death.
Bring him to me in silence.
But who’s that coming this way?
But who would dare tell her?
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet.
I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love.
I’ll run, devil.
Yes, sir.
I don’t know him.
There’s a ransom.
I’m Launcelot, who was your boy, is your son, and will be your child.
Exactly.
O Harry’s wife, do not triumph in my sorrow!
If I told you that, what would I get out of it?
Madam, here comes your husband.
His nurse, grandmother.
That’s Enobarbus?
I can’t believe that.
By my father’s death— Your life has dishonored his death.
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money?
And will you have me?
But I’m overjoyed!
Let me ask you something in private.
Don’t even think about refusing.
Two or three men, my lord, who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England.
Shall I include hell as well?
Be  Conrade!
I’m not coming.
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence’s troubles.
I assure you, sir, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
Your mother.
Yes, just like this.
Good.—Now come, Ariel!
If he doesn’t show up, the play is ruined.
Tell me.
Then I’ll call you a serving-creature.
to have a stupid wife.
If its juice is put on someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep, that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees.
Is she dead, then?
A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman.
Oh, don’t fight by sea, noble Emperor!
I’d rather get a husband from your father.
Listen, listen!
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately, and bring me their interpretation of the results.
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall.
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves”!
And you’re not suited for any place except hell.
If you’re my friend, tell me what you’re thinking.
Good-bye, good Queen.
They left me and my servant there, tied together.
I’ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run.
I tell you, though, it’s incredible how much she loves me.
Well, I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up.
Then I’ll tell you.
So, in that case, tell me who’s next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples?
There were no primary ones.
Mighty duke, please allow me to say something.
Yes it is, you half-blood.
It starts, “Shut up.” I’ll never be able to start if I shut up.
Really?
Their names are marked.
When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled.
Go tell him about this.
I couldn’t stay behind after you left.
Since you know all this is true, why do you blame me for loving you?
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar.
My king, they haven’t come back yet.
I’m sorry I was so wrong about him.
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister.
Oh, lying woman!
He’s a coward, a total coward.
And I came with him.
That part is up to you.
And here’s another poem, which I stole from my cousin’s pocket—in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick.
No metal—not even the executioner’s axe—could ever be half as sharp as your hatred.
You wouldn’t tell a sick man he “seriously” has to make his will—it would just make him worse.
His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir.
Fix your example, shepherd.
No, you don’t need to worry about us, Lorenzo.
Like an invitation.
No, my lord.
Octavius, I’m older than you are.
You know that he does.
Go, Sir Andrew.
There’s money in it for you.
Let the rain spray!
If I’m killed, it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead.
Good-bye.
Everything may still be all right.
You’ll find Beatrice there, talking to Claudio and the Prince.
Horatio, you’re the best man I’ve ever known.
We will go in together.
Why would anyone flatter a poor person?
I’ll go with you.
Shall we go see this fortification, men?
Here is the money.
As long as it’s honorable, you can be sure that I’ll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you.
Leave me alone for a minute.
Stop whining, devil.
Go ahead.
The things I’m saying are fair and honest.
Some other time.
Husband?
Beware Macduff.
You’re on very good terms with the duke of Exeter.
Someone who can ride fast, go to the duke of  Here, my good lord.
On my knee, I humbly ask your blessing.
It’s him, it’s him.
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn’t know that our situation was secure?
Let’s drink through midnight.
Well, it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly, too dark to be praised fairly, and too small to be praised greatly.
Please let me prove you’re a fool.
I’m going on alone.
Besides, they’re fresh.
You stole it from her?
Where is Polonius?
What support did I have other than Edward?
Right on time.
Let’s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods, not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs.
Once at Sardis and once last night, here in Philippi fields.
Fled to England?
Tonight I’ll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting—as if they came from several citizens—all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus, and all alluding to Caesar’s unseemly ambition.
Cassio, do you know who might have stabbed you like this?
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness’s mercy.
Rest easy in the meantime.
Where is that moron of a cook?
I’ll sleep here until morning.
The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.
My lord, the enemy has already passed the marsh.
Oh, here she comes.
What does my powerful master wish for?
Hello, sweet lady.
I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast!
Oh, my poor Rosalind, where will you go?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man.
Oh, you stupid Moor!
Wait, let me hire him too.—Here’s my fool’s cap, a token of my gratitude.
If you’re just insane, then get out of here.
Oh, good old man, you’re a great example of that old work ethic, where people worked because it was their duty, not just for the money.
You are my guests.
And they’ve got their swords unsheathed!
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you, Ceres, goddess of the fields and the earth, to leave your rich farms of wheat, rye, barley, oats, and peas, the hills where the
Will either of you give him the message that I’m challenging him to a duel?
Give me some wine and let me say a few words.
After you cast your magic spell on me last time, I sent you a ring.
I wouldn’t allow any commerce.
What’s up, Grumio?
You sing, and I’ll dance.
Oh Stephano, do you have any more of that wine?
I swear on my life and honor, he’ll sit here in the stocks until noon.
If that’s true, which it is, she might as well be in love with a dream, the poor lady.
Now please leave me alone.
Be patient, sir!
On this hill and in despair, with his slave Pindarus.
Yes, monstrous, monstrous!
He has almost finished dinner.
In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it.
I swear to you, many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before.
I’ll rest now.
You won’t, then?
Ladies, you’re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people.
I’m as commanding as she is proud, and when two raging fires meet, they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them.
You’re awfully eager to fight.
Pardon me, lords and gentlemen who stayed awake.
Thank you.
Here it is.
I’ll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen.
Imagine, me, a drunk!
Monster, I’ll kill this man.
The other day I saw him defeated in a
He’s having a fit and talking nonsense.
Now, you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August’s labors, get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here.
Yes, those are the best clothes.
I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia.
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes.
Tsk, you’re wrong.
No, no more than is reasonable.
Romeo cried out, “Stop, my friends.
Is he sane?
Here’s another, stronger than the first.
Write all this
When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn’t feature more than one famous man?
You and I, and honest Casca, we have epilepsy—we’ve fallen.
Curse the day this happened, but it did.
Who was it?
The only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it, too.
You can have anything you want.
Hurry up and get to your horse.
Where’s your master, Dromio?
What are you talking about, man?
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot, does that mean, you think, that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot?
I’ll bring you to him.
These ones, then, will be assassinated.
You can’t tell a story simply when it’s a lie.
Old Montague is here, and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad.
But, sir— Why should you do this, you want to know?
I will be angry.
Don’t “ Yes, Nurse, what about that?
But I’ll go in.
Listen, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
I swear— By nothing, because this is no oath.
My niece Olivia will notice, and let me tell you, no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage.
Tomorrow’s a good day.
You saw my master wink and laugh at you?
Tell her that I’ve been arrested and the money will be my bail.
Yes, my lord.
Since it’s drizzling, stand under this overhang with me and, like a true drunk, I’ll tell you everything.
The demon Hoppedance is in Tom’s belly, crying for some fish to eat.
Are they all ready?
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber.
Where’s Dolabella?
Worse than that, she’s polluted herself, so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce!
Madam!
So come with me.
Oh, you villain, villain, you damned, smiling villain!
For what?
I feel tortured by all this talking.
So go on, tell me the news.
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I’ve strived mightily, with all my wits and energy, to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties.
Quickly, tell me how.
With his own lightning bolts; I’ve shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars; I’ve opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them, letting them out with my powerful magic.
If he has a face like yours, a good scratching couldn’t make him look any worse.
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo—by its bad voice.
Nothing else, for God’s sake!
I’ll obey you until I can make bail.
That’s strange.
Someone who was always near you.
Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart.
There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
I’m not Lear.
While I waited, I’d frown impatiently, and perhaps wind my watch, or play with my—with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing.
What’s the news, my good friends?
Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
The king has agreed to every point: first his daughter, then everything else, as you strictly proposed.
I swear, this fool has an excellent singing voice.
Soldier, why are you wearing that glove in your cap?
Isn’t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it?
Show.
Oh God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
They’re saying I’d be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear.
But I, who have never known how to beg and never had to beg, am starved for food, dizzy with lack of sleep, kept awake with curses and fed with brawling.
Oh God!
You were one of his favorites.
The ship was already sailing.
He looks skinny, like a dried herring without its eggs, and he hasn’t got his girl.
You know what they say.
She was lying even as she was going down to hell.
Can he even get angry?
There’s a nicer piece of work right here.
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy.
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you.
I am not some fiend of hell: you can’t get rid of me with spells.
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.
I saw the handkerchief.
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet.
Friends, come here.
My lord, what are you talking about?
I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave.
But you, my noble lords, may name a time, and I’ll second it on the duke’s behalf, which I don’t think he’ll mind.
Are you a god?
Too bad about the son!
I told you, someone’s at the gate.
In every one of the lords' households I have a servant paid to spy for me.
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking, Edmund.
The most beautiful queen they ever had.
They’re coming.
Shall I stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without you?
It looks that way.
What did he do to you?
Listen up, you slave.
The moon?
Well, aren’t you a good man?
How is it, my husband—oh, how is it—that you have become a stranger to yourself?
Now talk to him in your own voice, and tell me how he is.
So he’s dead?
Well,        Aren’t I right, Jephthah, old man?
Yes, my lady.
Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus.
Bad times?
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you’ve gotten rid of such a criminal.
Good night.
There’s something going on that’s not what it seems.
Good, very good.
Yes, madam.
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave?
I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet.
Yes, my lord.
Horns?
Why are you silent?
I serve the king, who sent me here.
But to say that Tybalt’s dead and then say, “Romeo has been banished.” To say that is like saying that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all been killed, they’re all dead.
Shouldn’t she just accept that?
In fact, she’s crazed.
Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak.
Here I am.
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia.
It’s arranged.
Foolish dogs, blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples.
Oh, Antony!
And I get sick when I can’t look at you.
Hurry, Messala, and I’ll look for Pindarus in the meantime.
In fact, every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself.
Would you like to hear some music, my sweet love?
This is going to be great!
You armor my heart.
No, I’m as honest as I am Christian.
Why should men be more free than women?
Go!
I’ve already sent the proof in my letters.
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on.
His daughters want to kill him.
Fulvia is dead.
We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp.
I know you are loyal and honorable.
Don’t let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom. 
By God, I will tell the king about these taunts.
Yes, I’ll say it again, my lord.
They’re natural enough.” I think these things are omens of things to come in our country.
A lioness gave birth in the streets, and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead.
Oh, these men, these men!
I’m going to Count Orsino’s court.
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did, give me my advice back again.
Yet I wish I could take that promise back, so I had it to give again.
Our Queen is dead too.
Stay down, heart.
What are you going to do for a father?
All this excitement has made the time fly by.
Come, come, hurry up.
This fight will decide who dies.
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed.
Where is that damned wretch, Tranio, who defied me in such a disgraceful manner?
I’m reminding your grace what you promised me.
Indeed, it’s a strange time.
My stomach’s a little upset.
But where is my love?
Don’t you have one word of joy?
They said they were acting for you.
He’s a fool and a spendthrift.
That’s why paintings of Cupid, the god of love, always show him as blind.
My lord, I don’t know what’s going on, but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before.
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns, like wave crests in a storm at sea.
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today.
I have the authority to dismiss this court, unless Bellario comes today.
My legs may be yellow, but I don’t feel blue.
I hear you say “proud” and “I thank you,” and then “no thank you” and “not proud,” you spoiled little girl.
No, you monstrous hags, I’ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world… I will do such things—I don’t know what I’ll do exactly, but it’ll be devastating.
Mine, too.
Welcome, sir.
The enemy gets larger each day.
Well, I’m nearly finished.
Here an angel’s lying in a golden bed.—Give me the key.
To bed!
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt.
His arrow has pierced me too deeply, so I can’t fly high with his cheerful feathers.
Marry her as you should have married her cousin, and I will let my revenge die.
The strangers are all gone.
If he’s got a message from the count, tell him I’m sick, or not home.
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend.
Here.
We’ll put a leash on this danger that’s now running wild.
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him.
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules.
To celebrate a marriage of true love, and give a gift to the lovers.
Oh, sir— Don’t think I’m flattering you.
How awful!
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep.
I’ve told you everything I know.
What would I do besides good?
I do.
Honest, my lord?
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds, as you call them.
Brother, I’m giving you good advice.
Stay, lovely Helena.
You haven’t seen him since?
That’s true, my good boy.—Come on, take us to that hut.
Dido was from Carthage, not Tunis.
Thank you, sir.
I’m going to find out what you’re thinking.
Are you really going to tell me that?
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune.
Hang out?” Who do you think we are, musicians in a band?
Why do you look like that?
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you.
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible.
Oh, please do.
Here’s the east.
Bad friends were.
You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have.
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
Did you say all?
I’m sorry about what happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all right.
They’ve recorded my crimes, and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story.
As for my daughter Katherine, this much I know: she’s not for you—more’s the pity.
He acts like a man in love.
No, my good lord.
I’ll tear it up when it’s paid.
Send the deed after me and I’ll sign it.
What right did he have to scold me like that?
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant, you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed.
Put a lot of cash together.
Very sad.
Agrippa, go start the battle.
Therefore, let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken.
You are my other self, my oracle, my prophet, my dear brother!
Then, in my tent, you can elaborate on your complaints, and I’ll listen.
Now that’s done, I’m going to walk on the fortification walls.
Indeed, my lord, the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths.
By all that’s holy, here comes Katherina!
Oh, Juliet, I already know about your sad situation.
Oh, sir, impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions.
From now until then seems like twenty years.
where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again.
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea.
I’ll get back at him another way.
And just try to remember a few rules of life.
I always pray for them 
End it, then, and everything is over.—Eros!—I’m coming, my Queen!—Eros!—Wait for me.
I will have to go on a journey to death soon, sir.
Have you had lunch yet?
Hey!
Good-bye.
What on earth does that mean?
How long has he been there?
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge, his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved.
If you tickle us, don’t we laugh?
I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill.
If I live to see it, I’ll never trust his word again.
Holy Saint Francis, this is a drastic change!
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours, it would be like pitting twenty men against one.
Well, what was your dream?
He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for him.
If you get nasty with me, Pistol, I’ll stab you with my sword, in fair play.
Good gentlemen, give me permission to speak.
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward.
How unbelievable!
Yes, but I know— What do you know?
Tell your men as much.
What’s the problem?
I’ll take a look at your letter.
No, I have a commitment.
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals.
Do you recognize the handwriting?
I’ll go to the right side.
Retreat!
Make yourself comfortable.
Let us die honorably.
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple.
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence.
On my honor, I swear I love Rivers with all my heart.
I wish you could!
Four o'clock in the morning.
Shame on you—get on board!
My lord!
We answered them, blow for blow.
There’s no face more sincere than one washed in tears.
What should I do that I’m not doing?
Travelers have never told lies, no matter what the fools at home accuse them of.
I see a voice!
Where did you die?
Helena, we’ll tell you about our secret plan.
Let’s proceed.
You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue.
Start the fire, good Curtis.
You think I’m kidding.
I think I hear Antony call me.
Romeo, come out.
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young.
I await justice.
Oh, that splendid Caesar!
He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to Ptolemy.
I’m your master, Dromio.
Now, don’t forget, you promised me something.
Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh!
I don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore.
Give me your hand, first. 
Once there, make your thoughts work harder, and witness a siege.
Is this the madman?
Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony.
I’d wager twenty times as much on my wife.
There’s a time for all things.
I’ll go my own way.
No, gentle madam.
Dear gods in heaven, what’s the reason for this?
The hour of death is approaching.
And now you’ve changed?
Why?
I can’t tell who’s who.
All right.
I remember him well, and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise.
Will you come with me?
He is taking care of it as we speak.
I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando.
This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine.
But, uncle, you know how to bear with him.
And my heart too.
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush, his countrymen, that he’d rather have Antonio’s flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed.
Now I’ve said it twice.
Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten.
Sirs, I ask you to sleep in my tent.
I’m not one of his punk friends who carries a knife.
Just as tall as my heart.
But who is that?
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence  I’ll write “Rosalinda,” Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman.
Neither?
Where do you live, pretty young man?
His son was a minor only two years ago.
What good luck!
Because that’s what you are now.
And don’t be suspicious of me, noble Brutus.
Do you want my true opinion?
Look, here he comes.
Don’t spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath, when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard’s blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made.
I won’t sleep until I’ve delivered your letter, my lord.
Go away and let me die.
Don’t insult me with your distrust.
Take this.
Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages.
Bad deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide them.
If you’re going to lend us this money, don’t lend it to us as if we were your friends.
Cobble you, sir.
After you.
No, none at all.
What do you want?
God doesn’t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him.
Do you want to go hunting, my lord?
I would have met you by sea and again by land.
No, my lord.
Good-bye.
Then run away.
Tell him that when our noble father, the duke of York, gave his three sons his blessing, he never imagined that our friendship would come to this.
If we were in front of our armies, about to fight, I would do this.
But I would kill you by petting you too much.
Who’s shouting?
I can read.
Not offensive at all.
My father—I think I see my father.
Yes, and that’s surprising, because lovers are usually early.
We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars.
That’s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down,            Please, uncle, hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie.
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this!
Now he’s telling the story.
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him?
Hey, Cassio!
Oh, cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe, or I’ll faint from this deadly news!
Then repeat this after me: you can’t expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.
I’m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young, and what he would do now if he weren’t so old.
He is the prince of horses.
You’ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me.
Let those who would mar this fair land’s peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth.
I’ll send my prayers with him.
I’ve been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power.
I don’t want to dance.
I’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria.
Say welcome to all of our friends for me, sir, for in my heart they are all welcome.
And everyone can say “welcome,” which is just a word.
There is a poor old man who, purely out of love, has limped after me for miles.
You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed.
Here comes his Majesty.
Eros!
Nonsense!
Tonight she is shut up in her room, alone with her sadness.
What do you want?
I’ve got to go.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers—where the swords hang.
God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive.
Our love, which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air, may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet.
But Roderigo, if you’re as courageous and determined as I think you are, then wait just a bit longer.
But don’t expect any more than that.
If you’re not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night, then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me.
Spring, summer, fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places, and now the confused world doesn’t know which is which.
God give you joy, Petruchio.
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born.
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed.
Then there’s the Count Palatine.
In short, when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan, he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body, cutting my arm.
I think you’re an ass.
Is she as tall as I am?
I assure you, my man is as true as steel.
How are you and your master getting along?
If you’re the lady of the house, then it’s true you’re stealing your role, because what’s yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself.
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond.
We won’t, sir.
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell.
Do my simple features please you?
I’m very glad about that.
Now you’re Romeo.
Quiet, children, quiet.
She’s obedient—a fine lady.
From now on, take care of your messages yourself.
He’s been captured or killed.
We will speak about this further.
I want my bond.
which any peace-lover can do.
Sweet mistress—I don’t know what other name to give you, or how you’ve figured out mine—you seem as
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus.
Ha?
Made it for me?
May you only give birth to male children, because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine.
The old guy.
He speaks bluntly, madam.
Please, tell my father, madam, I won’t marry yet.
I’m sure he’s out there dancing.
Please stay seated.
You won’t stand and fight.
I’m speaking for the king, but I look like myself.
Well, okay.—I swear to God, both their stories match.
Go up there and second his petition.
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy.
If I let him go, I’ll have to pay his bail fees myself.
Good to see you, Signior Hortensio.
Did you say Caesar fainted?
Until her beautiful life’s end.
Am I not wise?
Let go of his arm.
Good afternoon, good gentleman.
Off!
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld.
Oh, he’s a dangerously clever boy—bold, quick-witted, capable.
You won’t see anything like that, sweetheart.
You who are beautiful beyond words, calm down and let me explain myself.
Go back to your lord.
We’re glad to see you.
I’ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him.
But as a gentleman and a soldier he’s promised me he won’t hurt you.
Goodbye, dear Father.
No, I won’t stay a second longer.
Well, good for him!
I haven’t seen him recently.
Then don’t make yourself too conspicuous.
My noble kinsman, welcome.
Well, you can go now.
Now what?
Go be with your love, as it was decided at your wedding.
Do you know them?
If you had any sense of pity, or manners, you wouldn’t pretend to fight over me like this.
Really, I’ll help.
Please, if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man, buy the cottage, pasture, and flock for us, and we’ll pay you for it.
I’ll get the general’s surgeon.
Oh, I was such a beast to be angry at him.
If you’re happy with what you’ve won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny, Then turn to where your lady is, And claim her with a loving kiss.”
Yes, yes.
Come on, noble captain.
Well, you have given me great comfort.
Then they’re cold friends to me.
I know a lady in Venice who’d walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him.
I won’t refuse you anything.
That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again.
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
But what love could make my Lysander leave me?
Justice, find the girl!
The earth has bubbles, just like the water, and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth.
Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with.
Oh, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.
He wants me dead.
Are you going to let us in?
There they go, Silver!
I have a good reason to cry, but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry.—Oh, Fool, I’ll go mad!
I’ll drain the life out of him.
Ha, ha, ha!
It’s good we’re doing this.
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy.
I’ll go back to sleep now.
If you wish to speak of love, speak more softly.
Gentle gods in heaven, please let me die.
Well, you have made a foolish choice.
You’re less happy, being feared, than they are in fearing you.
He’s married, madam.
Where are my slippers?
Stop right now!
Therefore, in case he does, we must hold him back.
Gentlemen, we won’t stay here and anger you further.
If this were a play, I’d complain it was unrealistic.
A friend.
Look how she rubs her hands.
Demetrius is an admirable man.
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks?
Launcelot, what’s going on?
Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself won’t eat a woman.
Why should he call her a whore?
I swear, I scorn the word.
We don’t want you to think we came here to offend you, except that we want to offend you with our good intentions.
Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud.
Tell the actors to hurry.
Yes?
Each day new widows howl, new orphans cry, and new sorrows slap heaven in the face, until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain.
Everyone’s there except Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone to look for you at your house.
I’m in a rush.
A ship you sent me to find, to book passage out of here.
Have them click their heels together and don’t dare touch a hair of the master’s horse’s tail till they kiss their hands.
Who will thank us now?
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?
Honestly, sir, we say that we are not criminals.
Then tomorrow we’ll find that they feel only like eating, not like fighting.
Into my grave.
I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all.
That’s good advice.
Nothing.
Yes, he was.
Don’t you recognize me, father?
What does  You’d have a great hairstyle if you had.
Peace to you, my lord of Burgundy.
Goodbye.
Oh Setebos, these are handsome spirits!
Two hundred ducats.
They’re just flattering me.
Revenge.
You’re in a bad mood?
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast.
After a brief time—as he is a strong, brave man—
Oh, is that so?
Doesn’t that make you want to cry?
No.
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear.
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master.
Blow the trumpets.
Good Ursula, go wake my cousin and ask her to get up.
Be angry whenever you like, it’s all right with me.
No, Cassius, no.
I’ll tell him the news.
She had no food today and will have none.
I’ve been hurt.
I could be convinced if I were like you.
I’ve told you what I intend to do, and I’ve sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract.
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before, and it’s not natural either.
Go ahead, do your worst.
Even though I don’t see it, this lady thinks I’m a marvelously good-looking man.
Are you insane, old man?
Don’t let them know fear.
Okay, now I’m dead.
If you would have such a man, take me.
And let us swear to our resolution.
Is he married to Cleopatra?
I swear to God, madam, you’ve wronged me, and I’ll tell the whole world.
We are responsible for this. 
Didn’t you just say he was?
Musicians, play us a song.—Prince, you look sad.
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman’s clothing.
Around three or four o'clock, look for news from the meeting hall.
Feeling the loss like this, I can’t help but weep for him forever.
From this, I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end—just as many arrows, shot from different points, converge on a single target; just as many roads meet in a single town; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea; just as the many radiuses of a 
We say the king is wise and good, and his noble queen is getting old, pretty, and not jealous.
Do you know him?
Yes, I’m sure he’s dead.
You’re hitting close to home there.
Oh, it’s dreadful, dreadful, Iago!
He deserves only honor, complete honor.
You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of, whatever it is worth), and I’ll go and pray.
The British troops are coming near.
Whether your banquet is first or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best.
So is my horse, Octavius, and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants.
It’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind.
He did this in public?
From that cabin I’d call out to my soul.
A kind good night to all!
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, on pressing state business.
Call the priest.
I’m listening to you only because I’ve got nothing better to do.
Please, uncle, let’s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you.
What can possibly fix this situation?
No, don’t.
Quiet!
And if they don’t find charity there, they find it someplace else.
You see, we’re not alone in our unhappiness.
As Edgar, I’m nothing at all.
What have you done?
My child, my reason for living, wake up, look up, or I’ll die with you!
How many wonderful creatures there are here!
One of us will stay and stand guard.
Sir, such a life with such a wife is unlikely!
Why are you curious, Iago?
Farewell.
It’s shameful, and we have to make some changes right away.
Me neither.
Sin from my lips?
I’ve been stripped of everything, betrayed.
Hail, brave friend!
Where’s your master?
He’s too argumentative for me.
What, are you busy?
Laertes, I want you to hear what they say.
Yes, sir, very well—I’m here in your orchard.
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you.
He’s not himself because he feels so ashamed.
Everyone join hands.
I don’t think you’ve got much of a reason to love me.
My lord the ruler of Burgundy, I’ll speak to you first.
Thisbe?
Tell him to surrender.
They’re louder than the storm or us sailors.
Let me try: If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do.
My old bones are tired.
Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet.
And return to us immediately, bringing Messala with you.
Hunting what, Curio?
Why are we talking about this?
I hope he’s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him.
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes.
I can’t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse.
I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty.
You disgust me, you little bug!
Let’s not get gloomy in our reminiscing, since there’s no reason for sadness anymore.
There, where the torch is burning.
We’ll go to the river.
It’s almost five o'clock.
The wooing is like a Scottish jig: hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion.
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her.
Come here, captain.
And she is very smart.
Wait, here’s a coin for you.
I’ll do whatever the king wants.
But you didn’t, even though you had every reason.
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests, okay?
Why are you so sad?
We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time.
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye?
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.”
But with you it’s different.
Don’t sleep so close to me.
A Roman.
It might happen that these strange signs, the unusual terror of this night, and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today.
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you.
I just meant that our hearts are joined, so we can almost think of them as one heart.
Why, Dromio?
Huntsman, look after my hounds.
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia’s African servant.
I can.
Let’s go inside.
He loves Caesar best, but he also loves Antony.
Thank you.
Claudio!
Listen, my lords— We’re in a bit of a hurry, Leonato.
The captain who brought me to shore has my women’s clothes.
Lovely Katherine, if you will love me well with your French heart, I’m happy to hear you confess it in broken English.
I’ll wake him, because that’s my job.
Cry, “whoa!” to your tongue, please.
Are you really as in love as your poems declare?
What did that gentile fool say to you, hmmm?
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point?
He got there too late.
Keep an eye on Cinna.
I won’t beg the gods to punish you, or caution you to fear their judgment.
So I thank you all, and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone.
Speak.
No, no, he’s dead.
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed, but I am a virgin, and I will die a virgin and a widow.
With the quick, intelligent wit she’s rumored to have, she can’t really be such a bad judge of character that she’d refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick.
Antonio will guarantee it, hmmm.
Do you see this sweet sight?
Stay with us tonight.
You seem a little depressed about this.
The English army is near, led by Malcolm, his uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
Go find those herbs for him, before his madness puts his life in danger.
Welcome back to Denmark, my lord.
I’m so sorry.
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war, since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot.
God knows I waited for you in anguish, pain, and agony when I gave birth to you.
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock.
So, if they die unprepared, the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they’re finally being punished for.
I was told that you were violent, proud, and sullen.
And I’m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little, I need to scratch.
That’s like hot ice and strange snow.
And now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk!
Was a man ever as dirty as me?
It’s good you hunted for yourself, sir.
You’re looking for Lord Hamlet.
No, keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well.
Oh, I’m talking too loud.—Where’s Malvolio?
The other half goes to the state.
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute?
The tyrant I’m serving now can go to hell!
Richard, a fiendish spy for hell itself, still lives, but only long enough to buy souls to send below.
That man always looks so sour!
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.
We heard it very clearly.
Richard, the duke of Gloucester, is very dangerous, and the queen’s sons and brothers are haughty and proud—it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects, not rulers.
Forever and forever, farewell, Cassius!
Please, don’t forget to leave me a tip.
Let me come clean.
Listen!
Yes, as kind as snow to a harvest.
He was crazy to run away.
Welcome, good Cambio.
I’m not sure, my lord.
Here.
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place.
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide.
Where’s Antony now?
Your clothes aren’t spattered with my family’s blood, and you aren’t affected by my curse.
Never a moment of peace!
God bless you, sir.
Yes, that’s quite likely.
I love you all the more for not liking it.
Father, take pity on him.
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
Please, hurry.                    
Don’t trust rotten planks.
You have forgotten, and you think it’s a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean, or run on the north wind, or do business for me underground when the earth’s frozen solid.
I said “your husband.”—Do you understand that word?
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her.
Take comfort.
Her eyes are like April: full of showers.
Oh, I can buy twenty husbands at any market.
And this is Metellus Cimber.
She’s full of good advice.
But really, are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind?
Yes, here it is.
All right then, confess and live.
Well, that’s a fine answer.
Nonsense!
Now get out of here!
Pretty, Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her, smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans, which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them, undoing what they did.
Because who is this man they follow?
It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks.
Passionately”?
But come on, let’s see you do your dance.
The day will come when you’ll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous, hunchbacked toad.
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting.
I’m sure you both remember me.
Hello, spirit!
Sleep well there on the ground.
A drum, a drum!
Here it is, I think.
You’re a cobbler, are you?
He’d really be your proxy if he married you.
I don’t think so!
Come on, let’s go inside.
Let’s do that.
We were somewhere where I couldn’t pick a fight with him, but I’ve decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again, whereupon I’ll give him a little piece of my mind.
Well then, saint, let lips do what hands do.
Into God’s hands.
I’m not a paid messenger, my lady.
Some of them give me money, some invite me places, some thank me for the kind things I’ve done for them, some try to sell me things.
I am no tyrant but a Christian king, whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons.
He doesn’t have children.
So hurry up, because we have twenty miles to cover today.
Why?
Put on your nightgown, in case someone comes and sees that we’re awake.
Are all the cups and glasses in their places, the tablecloths laid out—everything in order?
When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything?
Yes, let her die and rot and go to hell tonight.
I think this night is just like sick daylight.
Those are only two of his weapons.
Go and tell them this.
Go away!
I wish I could sleep too—it would stop me from thinking.
I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s.
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply.
Now all is for nothing.
It’s a disgrace to us all.
That’s right, uncle, talk to your heart, like the  Good morning to you both.
Under Captain Gower, my liege.
When did I ever do you any harm?
Why, what do you imagine his name to be?
The Queen is here, my lord.
I will kiss your lips.
Oh, Cassius, I’ll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me.
You will.
And just for today, Oh, Lord, just today don’t think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown!
I know the sound of his walk.—Die, villain!
Do you hear us, sir?
But it’s enough to know that the day will end, and then the end will be known.
The “passionate” duke?
She shall not.
He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it.
So long.
Go away, now.
You’ll get there two days before me.
Watch out!
Get up and tell me how you came here.
It’s locked away in my memory, and you’ve got the key.
Listen.
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano’s talking about, because he never lets me get a word in.
I’m only trying to keep the peace.
Take revenge for his horrible murder, that crime against nature.
Here, catch this box.
Come now, keep your oath.
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night.
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies, enchanting everything you put in.
It’s a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal.
If that’s true, I think the same thing about you.
We’ve advanced too far.
Call out my household servants.
Who sent you this time?
In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome.
I know that my hour has come.
Have I waited so long to see this morning, only to see this?
What an idiot this guy is!—You’re a rotten piece of work!—I beg your highness, beat him up and take his wine bottle from him.
So confess your sin freely now.
Take my advice.
You’ve already stained our sheets with your lust; now I’ll stain them with your whore’s blood.
I’ll do any decent thing, my lord, to help my cousin get a good husband.
If you choose the one that contains my picture, we’ll be married right away.
But I won’t let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows.
The British forces are on their way here.
Good morning, General.
I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position.
I did, my lord.
What’s that trumpet?
I’ll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood.
Oh, goodbye!
Hey, hurry up, hurry up!
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies.
Stay where you are.
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago.
I’ve done no more to Caesar than you will do to me.
If she was young and passionate, she’d move as fast as a ball.
Why, sweet Othello—   I haven’t done anything to deserve this!
I thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
Good-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye.
We’ll take care of it.
He’s not your relative.
Look at you!
I humbly say goodbye.
Run, everyone, run!
It’s as silent as a graveyard here.
I don’t understand all dat.
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we’re talking all about her.
Gertrude, he says he’s found out the reason for your son’s insanity.
Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are.
I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others.
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier?
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome — The actors have arrived, my lord.
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams.
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands, and great warriors aren’t  Ha, ha!
He’s an honest man who detests evil actions.
It doesn’t matter.
Come, Grey.
You’ve got it wrong, old man.
The chicken is burning, the pig is overcooked, the clock has already struck twelve, and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek.
I thank my heart—the poor fool—for it keeps away from seriousness.
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness.
Oh, please let me.
I don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words.
Yes, I know her age down to the hour.
I’ll be nearby.
My dear Gloucester!
Then Antony offered it the third time.
That’s a Cornish name.
Send him on his way quickly.
Wait a minute, Jew.
Give me one good reason to think she’s cheating on me.
You can’t have anything but the penalty, to be taken at your peril, Jew.
That’s some nap.
After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else.
And to you, most noble Caesar.
Yes, my lord.
Look, I have a weapon, the best sword a soldier could have.
Yes, and more.
Yes, it’s definitely nippy.
Whatever seems best to you.
Here, sir!” You stupid, unpolished dolts!
You drunken slave, I sent you for a rope, and I told you what to do with it.
Oh, immortal gods!
If not, the Fates are on the side of the traitors.
Who is it?
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia.
Could that be a lawyer’s skull?
I’ll stop your mouth with a kiss.
Listen!
Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent— Look behind you!
I wish you all the best.
He is in love with Hero.
These lovers are saying some strange things, Theseus.
Whoosh!
Our troops are deployed tomorrow.
Doesn’t my wit suit me well?
What is this fuzzy logic?
It’s lovely to see you.
Sister, you know he promised to give me a necklace.
If I owe you anything, I’ll pay you in clubbings.
You’re wrong, sir, very wrong.
Not good ones, please.
If it turns out he wasn’t, certain people are going to get it.
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda, who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day.
I can see what’s in broad daylight.
What garment would your Honor like to wear today?
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding.
Where will the old duke live?
Yes, that’s my husband’s name.
What is it, Agrippa?
Let them come—I don’t care.
Why have you come here in such a mob?
But I have the meantime.
You’ll know about that later.
He’s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king.
Another hit.
Death didn’t conquer 
It is not courteous, you know, to assume you know my meaning before I’ve finished talking.
Oh what a curse marriage is!
He was a great human being.
How old are you?
You can hear them all night long.
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room, with the stinking water covering them up to their chins.
Oh, please be true, please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you, my dear brother!
I’m going to England.
Do you know any, Hero?
Take off my armor.
Here I am at your service, my dear lord.
Isn’t that strange?
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s good for you.
Soon we will toast around the table.
What if I had a rat in my house, and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated?
You’ve already done something you should be sorry for.
Go blabber with your gossiping friends.
I will, my lord.
Here he is, here he is.
Let’s do that, Lysander.
He will have only justice and his penalty.
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.
Let thunder flatten the spherical world, crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings, and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow!
What marvelous music!
And your lies caused this murder.
Are you down in the dumps?
Let’s have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises.
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince, who has compromised his honor by making the match, and Claudio, whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who’s pretending to be a virgin.
And since we dream at night, time passes quickly then.
I’m an honest Puck, and I swear that if we’re lucky enough not to get hissed at, we’ll make it up to you soon.
No, you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation, quiet and pleasant.
Come with me to see the duchess.
Caesar was a tyrant.
Pompey has a strong navy.
She is so generous, kind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can, even more than she is asked to do.
You talk to him, ma'am.
And it’s definitely better to cry because you’re happy than laugh because you’re sad!
Because of me?
Really, cousin, it’s him.
Since you left, I’ve been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams I’ve ever had, my lords.
Oh, horror, horror, horror!
You may think that I don’t love you.
What do you think will be the result of this storm?
No, you must see them as your father sees them.
Do you carry a pike?
Silly babbler, how you talk!
Scum!
Caesar’s talking.
May God in His mercy forgive you.
The poor people died.
Ambition shouldn’t be so soft.
Please, tell me some of them.
Oh no!
Give me your hand, Kate.
Your words have moved me, and maybe it’ll do some good.
I’m terribly sleepy.
Exactly right.
Tell me to tear up this contract.
Quiet there!
These were sweet omens!
It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that.
Indeed, the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they’ll beat us, they have such an army.
No, not sure ones when we’re talking about something unsure.
Okay.
Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore.
Leap and dance for him.
Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time.
The clock says it’s daytime, but dark night is strangling the sun.
No, it’s certain, Iras.
They can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true.
If things are the way people tell me they are—and they’re only telling me this to warn me—then I have to say, you’re not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show.
If I were, I wouldn’t need to ask you what happened.
Tell me, how did you get in here?
No, this fun is not for me.
Oh, I hate looking at his face now!
You look like a person who knows the business of war.
Hold on a moment, and listen to my advice.
Will you take me, my lady?
Let your anger fall on me then, even if its sharpness pierces my heart.
Tomorrow is the day.
That villain, Romeo.
I’ll leave him alone.
The king is getting up.
Honestly, no.
He’s dreaming.
You’re wrong, sir, I do care about something.
With this in mind, speak, my lord.
Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied.
The foul plan backfired on me.
Can you feel your legs?
Yes, sir, I’m here.
I pay you because you’re poor, not because you want me to buy this.    
If we welcome our punishment, we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly.
Oh, she could sing a wild bear to sleep!
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon, I’m the man in the moon, this thornbush is my thornbush, and this dog is my dog.
Then the wrong man is dead, and sweet revenge has gone wrong.
Go, bring him here, boy.
But you had better get back to Egypt again.
If I can believe my eyes, this is a fine sight to see.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
He’s the only worthy man in Italy, aside from my dear Claudio.
I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him.
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms!
Not at all, Touchstone.
One?
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man?
That’s a wise idea.
Sad or happy?
Yes, kind sister.
We’re still waiting for one more.
Come on, Iago.
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is—
You get my point, don’t you?
By this sword, I will.
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements.
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home.
I might as well go before the King of France, who took my youngest daughter without a dowry, kneel before his throne, and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive.
Cruel, cruel news!  
This is Casca.
When they feared death, they escaped with their lives; and now where they imagine they’re safe, they perish.
I know, prince.
I’ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors.
Read it, Mark Antony.
I repeat, he’s in love.
The hand of death has taken him.
Are you kidding?
Anyway, even if he had the money now, the Jew probably wouldn’t take it.
That’s not good.
I wouldn’t commit so serious a crime for anything.
There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face.
I’d like to introduce you to my friend.
I’m tired of you.
I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea.
Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant, gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him.
I’d never play pranks on you.
She is dead.
Not if you go away, there isn’t.
Fathers, never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent.
Antony” was divided between her heart and lips.
What’s new with you?
How is my wife?
No, you’re just taunting me.
Who are you, slave?
But you’re lying out in the cold.
So how’s my nephew Hamlet doing?
Did you hear this, Gonzalo?
It’s a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea.
It’s Brabantio.
Goodbye, my sweet lord.—Goodbye, my sister.
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition.
I haven’t come to steal your loyalty, friends.
If you refuse me, the laws of Venice have no validity.
He has a ring of mine, worth forty ducats, and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it.
My lord, he’s afraid you mean him harm.
I’m just stating the facts as I see them.
Too bad it’s spoiling our pleasure tonight.
Today our hopes are at an end.
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness.
If they seek battle with us, have them come down or else clear the field.
The general should be informed about this.
Get out, you horrible bastard, or I’ll gouge out your eyes.
Let me at her!.
Don’t bring me any more reports.
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house.
It won’t annoy you like me, because it doesn’t have a voice.
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home.
Is that called for in the contract?
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
What, I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I’m doing?
Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition.
If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success.
Three miles from here you can see it coming, a moving forest.
Why are you talking like that?
She says she thinks this is a prank.
Oh Scotland, Scotland!
I told him what I thought.
Please get him, my friend, I beg you.
No, most likely.
In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man.
Please just listen.
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her.
Hurry, go!
Who’s calling?
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit.—Regan, I’m bleeding.
Let’s fall on our swords.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
I’ll challenge him.
What do you want to do, Desdemona?
I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him.
Good-bye.
Just watch!
Ah, soldier!
How are you, soldier?
The will!
He’s got an answer for everything.
What else?
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes?
Eyes, look out for the last time!
She is not, madam.
It’s obvious.
But no more spooky visions!—Where are the messengers?
I’ll find you another horse.
Ha!
You have my consent.
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I’ll show you.
Even if he were as important a man as the devil—as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself—he’s required, see, your Grace, to keep his vow.
I’ll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church, if it’s at all possible.
I want you to live, since to me, death is happiness.
And then Pyramus showed up.
My lord.
How dare you serve it to me this way!
You go pale, you stare, and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens.
I told you before, and I’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor.
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves, and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror.
The day, my friends, and everything await me.
Please go inside.
This is what it’s all about— Please, I beg you— No, my lord, I’m comfortable like this, thank you.
Here comes another group looking for you.
There’s nothing like good hay, really sweet hay.
Follow her.
I won’t fail.
You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
Only God knows when we’ll meet again.
Look at me crying—what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy.
Killing pigs.
Now I’ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence’s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward’s sons.
Good night, Lord Brutus.
I remember he’s already occupied.
What, all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop?
By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk.
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind.
But quiet, be quiet a minute.
Are you that impatient?
But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth.
Where did you leave him?
They did, Fluellen.
I would’ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her, the lowest-ranking grunts and all, as long as I didn’t know anything about it.
I’ve stayed up all night many times before for less important matters, and I’ve never gotten sick.
I remember very well where I should be, and here I am.
I’m not sad, my lord.
This is what happens when you visit whores.
Are you sick?
This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors.
Good!
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind.
I never thought any less of him.
Welcome back!
Up here you can’t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks.
One thing is certain: he’s out of control.
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up.
I’m tired of it, and you say you’re tired of it too.
Go, you old housewife, go.
No, lieutenant—God, gentlemen—Help—Lieutenant—sir, Montano—Help, men!—The night guard is coming!
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land.
God knows why, but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey.
I’ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master’s.
Then I guess the whole world is one.
Oh, poor shepherd!
No, madam, no.
You couldn’t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew.
I must admit your offer is the best.
I’m sure everything will be fine.
Leave it alone, you fool.
A drum!
My friends told me as much, and I knew it, too.
But look, Cassius, Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they’ve been scolded.
I’ll take all who served Brutus into my service.
Go.
Could the lead one contain it?
Help!
Hurt him in eleven different places.
Tie him up, I tell you.
Cure her of that.
I like this girl!
What three things does drink make a man do?
Just tell me.
And that’s true too.
She’s talking.
What news can you tell me in this fast-moving, unsteady state of ours?
You’ll fall backward when you grow up, won’t you, Jule?” And she stopped crying and said, “Yes.” Now you stop too, Nurse, please.
Master, master, I’ve been on the lookout so long, I’m ready to fall down dead—but I’ve got one, finally!
I know who you are.
Madam, we have to go: the Prince, the Count, Signior Benedick, Don John, and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church.
And yet I do love you.
That’s not good, and no good can come of it either.
What can you do but be happy?
I plan to fall into the blackest despair.
I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be lying.
And what about that?
Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over!
Or maybe there’s a chance he didn’t drown.—What do you think, sailors?
Kings and noblemen served him.
No more, please.
Hold on, then.
And no doubt he is, gracious madam.
Yes, and I’ll keep crying a while longer.
Who is this?
It’s a very sad day.
My lord?
The spirits that know the future have told me this: “Don’t be afraid, Macbeth.
And has anyone ever won her, as I’ve done?
Oh, they say that dress surpasses all others.
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again.
But that’s not part of what I’m supposed to say.
Do you lie still?
For some reason he’s in prison now on some legal technicality, on Malvolio’s orders.
Bottom, you’re Pyramus.—And Flute, you’re Thisbe.
Hello, my friends!
Lucentio, sir.
Please, don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are.
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help?
Who’s there?
And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then France is yours and you are mine.
You’ve stunned him.
Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll stop here.
I don’t know what “poetical” means.
And what did he say?
Well, so-so.
And didn’t I finally arrive to comfort you?
And he’s not going to do any tomorrow.
Does Leonato have a son, my lord?
Haven’t I resisted even Brutus, begging from his knees?
Here’s Romeo’s man.
Is she dead?
It’s Mercutio’s relative, noble Count Paris!
He’s eager to see your head.
You’re overstepping your bounds now.
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you’re a relative, she doesn’t approve of your behavior.
Who’s that coming over here?
What news, man?
There is no better one on earth.
I’ll call it “Bottom’s Dream” because it’s so deep that it has no bottom.
I can’t go any further, sir.
But tell me what you’re fighting about.
I haven’t done anything to you.
No offense taken.
Caesar, you thought this would happen.
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you.
Cassio’s not dead?
Don’t worry about that.
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home, they cannot escape God.
Very pale, sir.
Retreat further, my lord, retreat further.
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy. 
Good evening, good evening.
You can trust me.
Certainly not!
Antipholus has gone insane, no question about it.
No, good goose, don’t bite me.
Since she belongs to me, I can do what I want with her—as the law says: I can either make her marry Demetrius—or have her killed.
I had no reason, no reason.
If you stop up the keyhole, it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke.
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland—always an unreliable neighbor.
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room?
If you can think of a more awful title, I’ll call her that.
Yes, yes, Curtis, so hurry up and start the fire.
Why have you collapsed?
I’ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you, and for no other reason.
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold.
If you go outside, arm yourself.
This is as rude as it is strange.
I still have the smell of blood on my hand.
If that’s all, gentlemen, I see no problem.
Isn’t it a pain that I can’t choose or refuse anyone, Nerissa?
Women are made for 
I think you’re denying what you really are.
The forests, the skies, the mountains, everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds.
I think it is, sir.
Your authorization is ready.
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed.
Go walk the path that you will never return from.
My songbird, we have beaten them to their beds.
He’s been killed.
And isn’t your husband an honorable man?
Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are!
You will always be welcome to me. 
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this.
If he’s caught the Benedick, he’ll lose all his money before he’s cured.
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it.
That’s enough.
No, uncle, I won’t be married.
This is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men.
I can tell that you don’t know who I am.
Well, at least that’s something.
What’s that, you runt?
Duke Solinus, my husband, and both my children—and you two Dromios, who marked the day of my sons' births with your own—come into the abbey with me for a new christening.
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me.
No, indeed, my lord.
Good friend,” he said, “say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt, and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire.
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive.
I took the hint and spoke to her.
Are you trying to sleep with him?
I wonder if you’d be so good, you lousy, rotten villain, to grant my wish and my request and gratify me, see, by eating this leek.
Sweet Desdemona!
Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession.
Someone else has the same name, but he’s a better man.
I’ll knock your teeth out, sir.
The king my father?!
What are you saying?
You’re standing.
I sent him there, sir, but his crimes deserved a worse punishment.
I won’t keep you very long.
She has been in a man’s bed.
And look, here’s Publius, come to fetch me.
God defend and guard us innocents against them!
Don’t believe any of us.
What a crazy island this is.
It’s not good for your health, either.
And she’s loyal, as she has proven.
What victory does he bring home?
I need people as trustworthy as you.
Bless you, master.
What is my nation?
What do you mean, lady?
What can I give you that you want, my lord, except the one thing you can’t have?
I swear, it must be thirty years.
There’s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea.
But if I ran away from the Jew, I’d be following the advice of the devil, who’s the very devil himself.
Away with the doddering fool!
Come on.
Now that you are down there, you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb.
And go away, witch, go away.
They’re really being spoken, sir, and they’re true.
Or just a foretaste of it?
No, in its tongue.
It has been done already, and the messenger is on his way.
Good night, madam.
I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news.
Oh, you excellent young man!
Look at him.
Madam, I will.
Signor Bassanio!
No, add a couple more syllables.
If we meet again, then we’ll smile indeed.
Me too.
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful.
Excuse me, sir?
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes?
Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep?
Horny animals!
Now be quiet.
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats?” Or should I bend down low, and in a humble and submissive voice say:
I’ve come to take you to the senate house.
Tomorrow, my lord.
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory.
Better late than never—and it’s never too late to change.
I took good care of you—piece of filth that you are—and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter.
I found it in my room, and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes.
Though we have lost a generous king, we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king.
It’s always like this in times of change.
My darling, when I gave my love to you, I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins—that I have noble blood, but no money.
Well, do your best.
As God is my witness, you know you’re mine.
We don’t know.
I overheard him and his plans.
That can’t happen.
Relent, and save your souls.
A nice stool.
You have to be patient, madam.
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom.
As a favor to  Nope.
I’ll go to lunch.
Phoebe, keep your promise to marry me, and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me.
Farewell, good Strato.
Bring ink and paper, Charmian.
Boy, your words can’t excuse the harm you’ve done to me.
But I’ll stop rebuking you.
No one shows mercy because he has to.
To which we all appeal.
I’ll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit.
We don’t need to hear it.
As eagerly as I ever came from school.
You’ll know more about it later.
Is Marcus Luccicos in town?
You’ll be my wife, dearest, and I’ll serve you forever.
I’ll listen to Cassius, and we will compare their reasons.
Tranio got you that time.
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now.—You know your job, brother.
And I followed him because I loved him.
What I think about this, and about what’s happening here in Rome, I’ll tell you later.
Let’s not leave him out.
Let’s go.
We came into the world as brother and brother, so now let’s enter hand in hand—not one before the other.
I’ll call you a minstrel.
Claudio, take my daughter, and, with her, take my fortunes.
Sir, is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly?
Who’s closest to him?
You are to bring his daughter to the supper.
I’m sure you do.
Well, let’s hope you stay in that noble frame of mind.
If I remember correctly, I can’t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately.
I won’t be gone long.
Alas, she has been too long exiled from France, whose crops all lie in heaps, rotting with ripeness.
Good.
Have you forgotten all the talks we’ve had together, the vows we made to be like sisters to one another, all the hours we spent together, wishing that we never had to say goodbye—have you forgotten?
What’s the matter?
You’re kidding!
Oh, how awful that a lady who’s been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one!
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt.
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man.
What handkerchief?
Yes, it’s just clothing.
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve, I already told her to come.
Is he really married?
Where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on?
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight.
But if you die before I return, you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts.
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections.
I should really leave right away.
Go back to my sister’s.
Don’t argue against it.
He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep.
Where is that poor rash man?
I could do it easily now.
Petruchio, let’s stand over here awhile.
have lost, and the indignity we have endured, for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back.
Here, take away the dish.
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest, who can tell you what marriage is all about, marry you.
Where are you going?
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt?
If you dare to fight today, come to the field.
I came from Corinth, Your Highness.
That’s him.
Here he comes.
Give it to my wife, and get your money.
I’d do anything to bring them back together, since I really care for Cassio.
I’ll be nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him.
I’m going to go drown myself.
Damn that crazy madman!
And when you do— Cassius, calm down.
I’m afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar.
This strong poison’s overpowering me.
And I know that by now they’re waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey’s theater.
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor.
And I think this is his house.
I’m telling you, this house is dark.
What an idiot that monster is!
What have you done?
We’re strangers here.
I must be gone.
I don’t expect him to answer for me, and yet I’m determined to fight vigorously for him.
My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now.
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind?
Quiet!
What?
He struck me from under your arm.
Oh, sir, the problem goes far deeper than you realize.
I also hope that we can be better strangers.
May God in heaven bless you.
You’ve said it well.
You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so.
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once?
Dead, dead?
What are you doing with a sword?
I’m hanging on every word.
When you’ve finished, go back to Pompey’s theater.
We’ll meet Macbeth there.
Oh, now I really need that priest who spoke to me today!
Doesn’t he deserve it?
How  What, are you jealous, Oberon?—Fairies, let’s get out of here.
In suicide, gods make the weak strong.
God keep me so.—Heralds, go with him.
Sir, sir!
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves.
He’ll do whatever Hastings does.
Edmund is dead, my lord.
And you’re all sizzle.
This is Lucentio’s house.
Come to think of it, I am feeling sleepy.
Well, that’s certainly out of this world, all right.
Farewell to you both.
That’s true, they are.
I will lower my voice.
Consider how young you are, and question your feelings.
You should know I’ve earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John.
The only glory princes have are their titles.
You won’t lose any respect.
It sang about my crimes.
It’s true, he died on the day my sister turned thirteen.
So, thank God, there is no real need for me, as I wouldn’t be able to help you much.
Are you ashamed of me?
Quiet!
Go get Aliena ready—because, look, here comes my Rosalind.
He wouldn’t say that.
I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again.
Very good, sir.
The servants Macbeth killed.
So is Lysander.
He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length.
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small.
Therefore, willingly and yielding.
May God’s arm strike on our side!
So have your money ready.
Why should you fall into so deep a moan?
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of.
I go over hills and valleys, through bushes and thorns, over parks and fenced-in spaces, through water and fire.
If this letter doesn’t make him fight, I don’t know what will.
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness, but if I went on I could outdo it.
He said he did—I don’t know.
The clock hasn’t struck yet.
You know I gave it to you just now.
Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy.
The earth sings when he touches it.
From now on this is what I’ll think of your love.
You opposed my taking part in the war.
I’ll smear my face with filth, put on a loincloth, make my hair matted and tangled, and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing.
She’s weak and will die unless you comfort her.
I’m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash.
A murderer should look like you do, so pale and grim.
Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from behind.
Seyton!
I hope you think I’m faithful to you.
We don’t think so, my lord.
How will that kill this marriage?
That’s true.
Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person.
Can someone fall in love this quickly?
Good morning, old Sir Thomas Erpingham!
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen.
With her, on top of her—however you want to say it.
If only his lord were more like him.
They can’t move till you release them.
Oh, quick, before I’m gone.
Tennis balls, my liege.
Do as I say.
Sweet Moon, I thank you for your sunny beams.
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony?
I have received letters that say the same.
Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility.
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.
Honest Iago’s arranged that.
Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in?
My sweet, so do I.
Come, firebrands, over here!
Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be.
Oh-ho-ho, sir!
Where’s the Master, Boatswain?
He will if he lives long enough to become a man.
That was excellent, really excellent.
Isn’t that him?
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand, sharp and dipped in poison.
Eyes, do you see?
A mature age.
How strange that they all got so sleepy!
If I’m lying, then
My heart feels like it’s about to explode.
And, in fact, I think they’re meeting together right now.
Look, sir.
Eat.
If we have sweet-smelling breath, I’m sure they’ll say “it’s a sweet play.” Now no more talking.
Deal?
God bless your Worship!
My food, my fortune, my sweetest hope, my heaven on earth, and my entrance to heaven.
The crown was offered to him three times?
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow, then sorrow would be highly prized.
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything.
Yes, making a big fuss.
I really want to sleep now.
Please, sir, restrain yourself.
Unfortunately, I love myself.
Or maybe I’ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay.
You are all most welcome here; please make yourselves at home.
Flies are like free men, but I have been banished.
If there were anything inside their heads, they could never wear such heavy helmets.
Tell me.
Birnam Wood.
When I tell him he hates flatterers, he agrees, just at the moment when I’m flattering him the most.
Hold your tongue.
Poor Tom’s chilly.
Very serious, and I’m sure it’s because of Beatrice.
Oh, you devil, you devil!
Go after her, go.
In private?
If you send them word that you won’t come, they might change their minds.
Go with me to the tomb.
Please don’t make fun of me.
The queen is dead, my lord.
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed, then it would be best to get it over with quickly.
What are you doing, wearing your best clothes?
Give me too much of it, so I’ll get sick of it and stop loving.
Hortensio, good friends like us can get by on a few words.
I’ll frown at them as they pass by, and they can react however they want.
I gave him the material.
Come, lady; you must die in order to live.
My God, it’s the same one I gave the judge!
Now please go.
Will you let me?
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan.
Then if we lose this battle, you’ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome?
Which plays, what music?
Can you hear me?
My beautiful Rosalind, I’m only an hour late.
Isn’t she proud of such a match?
We’ll see about that!
By God, I wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me, I think—not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory.
Oh, please, I’m begging you, don’t mention him again.
When did you become so fond of singing, boy?
The poor thing, he is so shaken with a fever that it’s terrible to see.
Sometimes you get a bit too wild, and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude.
I’ve got nothing to do with you.
Go!
Don’t I deserve more than this?
Please let me go.
This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love.
Stay, then.
Good day, Lieutenant Bardolph.
A devil like you could lead me to hell.
Be honest and helpful, and I’ll repay you for your efforts.
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch.
If I can’t do it myself, I’ll find someone who can.
This is a guy who’s been praised for his honest bluntness, and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words.
And did you see the handkerchief?
Madam?
And why are you so pale?
Why should I stay— In this vile world?
Give me the necklace!
Whom do you serve under?
Good gentlemen, look like you’re rested and happy.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo has been banished.
Get out, insolent eunuch!
Bring out the stocks!
Come on, Casca, you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise.
His imagination is making him crazy.
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine.
So you’re saying you’re not a whore?
My own flesh and blood turned against me!
Don’t tire yourself out, monsieur.
But what about your guilty conscience?
Referee!
But look, even if my dishes are poor, eat them with my best wishes.
I’m glad about that.
You are very welcome here.
We want to hear Caesar’s will.
Our fate depends on this chance.
Why, no, sir.
Get yourself to a convent, fast.
Macbeth!
Eighty ducats!
It’s the truth.
Sweet saint, for goodness’s sake, don’t be so angry.
What is your name, young man?
I’m only crazy sometimes.
What makes you say that?
Everyone who can hear has heard about it.
You’re shaking with emotion.
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb, and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven.
I can’t recall where I slept last night.
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland?
Oh, Cleopatra!
Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning.
No, sir.
Why, she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian.
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having.
Don’t you have any manners, you savage?
We’ll maintain that she died the instant she was accused, and everyone who hears this will grieve for her, pity her, and excuse her actions.
No, my lord, it’s been four months.
Give me comfort.
Is it lost?
He’ll have to kill both of us, and indeed we’re both men.
Since the wall is conscious, it should curse back at him.
We have slashed the snake but not killed it.
Don’t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea.
No, by no means.
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture.
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone?
Where, good Miss Mary?
No?
They were lusting after each other.
Who’s she?
It’s not manly to cry.
Now I’ll go see my priest, to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck.
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings, and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps.
Not from crying.
Pretty lady, I’m much ashamed of your shocking behavior.
It blushes, is easily embarrassed, and stages regular uprisings in a man’s heart.
Take credit, God, for it is no one’s doing but yours.
What is that bloody knife?
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master.
What do you think about it?
She’s a perfect woman, it’s true.
I’m not like that now.
As
What are you going to do?
I won’t have anything to do with it.
Come on, let me wipe your face.
You did it?
Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles.
Live, and from now on, say a madman mercifully told you to run away.
Well, I’ll hurry and put these papers where you told me.
Three-time traitor and whore!
He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” I’ll assume I deserve the very best.—Give me a key for this one.
Remove your armor, Eros.
I tricked your own eyes.
But why am I telling you this?
Well, I won’t.
Please, sir, I beg you.
And yet you’re the one who wants to teach me about restraint!
How did they die?
Here’s a drink.
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface.
What hope is that, may I ask?
Go, take your sweetheart and leave him to me.
No.
As for myself, I didn’t dare laugh, for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air.
I’ll look for him and secretly help him.
You’ll introduce me to him as a eunuch.
I tell you, there are good men born at Monmouth.
Most noble man, will you die?
He ran out that way, sir, when he couldn’t— Follow him, now!
Our friends are all waiting for you.
He is worth no more than that.
Great Queen Juno is coming.
Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love.
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great, I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey’s camp.
Her eyes are vicious, but yours are comforting.
Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school.
Goodbye, sir.
Only really cruel people can be called deformed.
A friend.
Why, too much freedom leads to woe.
Oh, let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to 
Why do you say that?
Don’t worry, sir.
Write them together—yours is just as good a name.
I can tell you’re furious, but I don’t understand what you’re saying.
This is that time.
And she screamed at me, right?
There is nothing distinctive, nothing remarkable left in the world.
But I’m running ahead of myself.
Listen to me, for I have something to tell you.
Near  How large is his land army?
Play your flutes!
If you have poison for me, I’ll drink it.
Oh God, Iago, what can I do to win my husband back again?
Whose house?
Why, man?
I curse her.
It’s too bad.
I don’t want to hear you sing.
And hello to you, fair sister.
It’s nothing, my lord.
Well, sir, go inside.
But it is his handwriting?
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork.
We won’t hold back any of our wisdom.
If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to?
Shall I accompany your Grace?
Look here, this is the entrance to his room.
Oh, what a fall it was, my countrymen!
They’re pretty busy in there.
Yes, my lord.
And now I’ll do it. 
I never saw it or suspected it, so it never hurt me.
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn’t have nerve enough to stand up for herself.
How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven?
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends.
He’s still sleeping, ma'am.
Then, to answer every man briefly, wisely, and truthfully—wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
Cruel, cruel Death killed her.
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me.
You are welcome here.
Actually, it’s my arm.
Oh, Cassio, where did you get this?
Let him come in.
Dear son, you’re alive!
Heaven keep you safe!
She’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
It doesn’t sound as sweet as it did before.
Please, be cheerful.
Take me to the garden.
There was no harm, I’m telling you.
Oh, my heart, my heart is rising into my throat!
Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
Ah, revenge!
Would you like to be king of the entire world?
From the Earth’s womb, many different sorts of plants and animals come forth, and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment.
If you still love her after that, then marry her tomorrow.
What’s your message?
But I haven’t eaten anything yet.
And I swear to God he’s very smart.
Are you joking?
I only partly believe it, for I’m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering.
What?
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night.
Where will we meet in the morning?
I am resolved—to let him live.
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers, do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it?
It goes along with being born to greatness, but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about.
On me, though I am barely half the man that Edward was?
I can’t wait to hear him call the drunkard “husband,” and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant.
Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain!
Oh, let me speak!
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows.
Well, the difference of a horse!
How the hell does he know our language?
What symptoms, my lord?
Now, welcome, Kate.—And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
Oh, spite of spites!
Agreed.
Amen to that!
And they’ve been plotting things together.
That’s it!
The Queen is coming.
If you want to read it, as I haven’t heard it yet, though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.
I’ve worked it out.
Prepare yourselves.
What is, my lord?
Even if she lives till the end of the world, she’d keep burning an additional week.
Your scolding is somewhat overblown.
Oh, dear husband, don’t believe everything you hear—or if you must believe it, don’t let it all make you angry.
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to.
The best thing about me is that I’m hardworking.
I’ll go put my armor on.
Bring me a bigger one.
For that reason he sends you this good news—that this very day your enemies, the queen’s relatives, will die at Pomfret.
That’s the right answer—it shows your love.
Yes, for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who’ve been married forever.
No.
Oh,” he said, “Did you fall on your face?
The humiliation is all mine.
God Almighty, there must be some essential goodness even in evil, if men would only look for it.
Yes, but the mustard is probably too hot.
Go get me a crow.
Oh, Lord, if they were married, they’d drive themselves crazy within a week.
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak.
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff.
The word is too good to represent her wickedness.
Why don’t you answer me, man?
With this marriage, all the petty jealousies that now seem huge, and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves, would disappear.
This is the door.
Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off.
He plans to leave tomorrow.
Strange things are about to happen, Edmund.
Tell him so yourself, and see how he takes the news.
Then there’s still a chance.
Yes, I want it, and I’ll get it.
I really think it was him.
I’ve been up all night.
No more than that, my lord.
Her husband, you rascal.
Like a good doctor.  
Excuse me, sir, do you know anything about this?
Give him the goblet.
What’s all the noise in here?
But now, I tell you—keep it to yourself, though—those enemies of mine are being put to death today, and I’m better than I’ve ever been.
I have to leave right away.
What’s the name of this forest behind us?
We know you have a job to do, Brakenbury, and we’ll do what you say.
Never mind.
Won’t he join us?
Don’t try to find out more.
If I ever come back, I’ll bring you good news.
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck.
Don’t be disturbed by my illness.
All my pretty little children?
Brother, I’ll go and bring it to you.
Didn’t they pass by you?
Oh, he’s acting just like Juliet, just like her.
That’s all I wanted to know.
If I died right now I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life.
Set down your honorable load, men, if there is ever any honor in being dead.
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war.
But what’s the joke?
You’re thinking something.
Here.
Show your slaves how mad you are, and make your servants tremble.
Absolutely, you idiot.
Oh, let us be merciful anyway.
Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin.
Who, Hero?
My husband!
Sir, I must get that diamond ring back from you.
You mean this is the whole problem, that she is shy and hasn’t said everything she means to say and do?—My lord of Burgundy, what do you have to say to this lady?
Make these men work.
Very near, my master.
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot, and together those twenty could only kill one man.
Thank you, sir.
Which ring did you give away, my lord?
Is it possible?
Why, what’s the matter with him?
I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her, but I won’t use one on her.
Lead the way.
What, an argument already?
Then you and I and all of us fell down, while bloody treason triumphed.
That your interest payments are like Jacob’s sheep?
Now I feel my soul leaving.
I was born and raised less than three hours from here.
Not at all, not at all.
As soon as the deed is done, you will be in my favor and I will promote you.
She will not.
I want my bond, so stop talking.
You’ve heard a lot.
Know the glove!
Hear me, you wrangling pirates.
I’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself.
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
You’re still here?
Yes, revered Queen.
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill.
She can turn and turn, and then turn on you again.
My door is locked.
I beg you to let me go.
It’s true, Hero says so.
That’s you, right?
Certainly, your grandmother had a worse match.
Until I know for sure, I’ll humor her.
Tell the hot-headed duke that I… But no, not yet.
In Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all.
I wish this trick would be over.
And that Mr. Shore’s wife has nice feet, cherry lips, pretty eyes, and a very pleasant way of expressing herself.
Saddle up my horses.
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act.
Don’t worry, I couldn’t care less.
Merciful God!
Right now I’d give a thousand 
Go ahead, then.
I know the people of Venice well.
Mercy, mercy!
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
Isn’t my name Hero?
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword.
And has my armor been put in my tent?
Be at ease.
I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around here.
Help!
I love you so much that I’ll send your soul to heaven very soon—if heaven will accept anything from me, that is.
Is he dead?
Your hand is  Well, I hope so.
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged.
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Yes, absolutely, no question or ambiguity about it.
And I’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with. 
Bring down that top sail!
That must mean a sword.
Say no more.
As I neglected practical matters, being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine, I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother.
Relax, gentlemen.
I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife.
I have a pretty good ear for music.
Now you’re sociable.
Was this ambition?
Now, I’ll begin: first, we came down a steep hill, my master riding behind my mistress— Both on one horse?
It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself.
But wait a minute.
Good idea.
Are you in your right mind?
You’re sick, yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker?
There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you.
That’s the way great men ought to endure great losses.
Don’t dishonor your mothers!
No, don’t throw any of it away.
How will you get proof?
But that is a false conclusion, since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves.
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that?
But it’s dark out, and it could be a trap.
Down with the Montagues!
Besides, he brings his fate with him.
Honestly, sir, I’d need to use words to explain why, and since words are so unreliable and false, I’d rather avoid using them in a serious discussion.
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill.
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree, with the help of her powerful assistants, and left you there for twelve years.
Follow them straight to the cottage.
I’ll go alone.
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage.
I will go out.
Officers, what crime have these men committed?
Listen!
No, I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you.
She is in a better place.
Portia, are you really gone?
Come on.
Come on, brother!
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— No, heaven forbid!
Oh, he’s really gone.
I won’t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers.
He’s as 
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped.
He really plays well.
Don’t shed any blood, or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh.
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn’t give you, as long as it didn’t damage my honor and self-respect?
Oh Lord, who’s that crying?
Farewell.
As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I thought I saw the forest begin to move.
That’s exactly what they said.
Look how lush and healthy the grass is!
A nice message.
Are you begging, brother?
Pain, yes indeed.
Yes, my lord.
Well, I’m the man you’re speaking of.
I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady.
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome.
It’s come again.
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city?
Since you’re letting me leave, I’ll hurry.
That’s a nasty garter belt.
Drunk?
I am the son of Marcus Cato!
So go away.
Well, that’s an  Stay, fellow.
I’ve got a plan that will fix everything.
Of what city, may I ask?
You haven’t lost it unless you think you have.
Oh, you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has “Benedick” and “Beatrice” written all over it?
I’ll do it right away.
Are you drunk?
Who are these men?
Where is that messenger?
What, are you crazy?
Did you hear that?
Romeo will thank you, my girl, for both of us.
Leah gave it to me before we were married.
I’ll deliver the message.
Maybe I’ll never go home again, Iago!
Does anyone here know who I am?
Your wit is too courtly for me.
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth, no more or less.
You may, Mark Antony.
Oh, she’s slow!
Oh, go away!
Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours.
But don’t go.
Oh, lieutenant!
I’m begging you.
Statilius waved the torchlight at us, but he hasn’t come back.
The work we enjoy is not really work.
Do you want me to lie, madam?
Seven days and seven nights?
Oh, wine is the devil!
Once she exclaimed, “Sisters, sisters, shame on you!
You may do whatever you want in the world.
Now I have to leave.
Kind gentlemen, I won’t forget the trouble you’ve taken for me whenever I think of this day.
Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed.
And you won’t tell me who you are?
You’ll do no such thing.
There, take my fool’s cap.
We’re safe from my father for at least three hours.
Buckingham, I need to have a word with you.
So, so, so, so!
Women are lucky, then.
Come with me, I’ll show you, and along the way, you can tell me where you live.
I found Orlando under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
Do you mean the king?
It’s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn’t introduce them.
Be sure to burn his magic books.
Pyramus is coming up to the wall.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
I’m in a mood to beat you up pretty good.
I can’t believe that.
Madam, his majesty asks for you, and for you, Duke of Gloucester, and for you, my noble lords.
I don’t owe her any duty—it’s you that I submit to.
What is the matter here?
It seems to me that your voice has changed, and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be.
You’re absolutely right, your highness.
Is it my mother?
For God’s sake, send somebody else.
Good Lord, how bright and splendid is the moon tonight!
Do you recognize this face?
Herbs, plants, and stones possess great power.
But, sir, here comes your servant.
It only looks a little paler.
Learn to see better, Lear, and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice.
Goodbye, then.
Did you say Cassio?
On my honor and by my word, if you outstay the ten days, you will die.
Oh, if it turns out to be true that he survived, then that storm was kind, and the ocean was full of love!
Oh, he’s like a snake disguised as a flower.
A friend.
What traitor hears me and doesn’t say amen?
With all my heart.
And then he’ll … he’ll … wait, what was I about to say?
She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to you.
I’ll go to him.
I can’t sleep quietly in the Tower.
Okay, I’m ready.
It won’t last.
For when you cut your shin.
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore?
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt’s corpse.
By the way, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
But I’m still fairly high-ranking.
Now that I’m done, Wall can go away.
If you can leave your body so easily, then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch, which hurts but is desired.
Gentlemen, let go of him.
It was Kent, sir, the exiled Kent, who, after the king treated him like an enemy of the state, put on a disguise and followed his king, carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave.
That he had sex with you.
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news.
Go as fast as you can.
I cannot speak your England.
The count’s messenger, Cesario.
Gloucester’s eyes?
Who does it stand still for?
Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away.
Finally, the ceremony done, he called for wine.
That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to.
Show us the way without further delay.—Trinculo, since the king and all our comrades are drowned, we’re the heirs of this place.—Here, carry my wine bottle.—Trinculo, my buddy, we’ll get that bottle refilled soon enough.
It’s nine o'clock.
And Walter couldn’t get his dagger out of its sheath.
I’ll do it with all my heart.
His highness is not well.
I honor him for being brave.
Damn it all!
You can go straight to hell!
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns.
Wasn’t he here?
A friend.
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions.
All right, then.
I must join the duke for lunch.
If you refuse, let an eternal curse fall on you.
Go to the harbor immediately!
But I’m sure he’ll get even with you.
I will not do them wrong.
Ah, Juliet if you’re as happy as I am, and you’re better with words, tell me about the happiness you imagine we’ll have in our marriage.
But where’s the money?
She’s not even fourteen.
He’ll make your palace tremble for this insult, even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe.
Come on, you and I will go soon.
I’m growing a beard.
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born.
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night.
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other, in the ordinary and equal clash of battle?
When I send for you, come out wearing masks.
You take your beauty sleep now.
It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more.
Gallus, you go with him.
And so will I.
What else?
But you know, sirrah, we customarily say that the dead are well.
Love’s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters.
I’m speechless.
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed.
Thirty ships.
The deal is closed.
I’ll go on with my speech praising you, and then I’ll get to the point.
Oh, please, tell us, sir.
Be patient until I finish.
Now that he’s old, we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws, which have turned into deep-rooted habits, but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age.
Was it mine?
In heaven.
She’s been dead for some time.
You don’t look well, Antonio.
I can’t find it.
Farewell, old man.
But tell us, did you hear anything about Antonio’s loss at sea?
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane.
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for!
My brave relative!
See, now I have you.
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me.
I wish they had stayed!
Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart.
That will be a good thing.
What should I say?
I tell you truly, in true English: I love you, Kate.
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with.
I’ll go get Beatrice for you, who can walk here by herself—she has legs.
Who’s his lieutenant, do you know?
I’ve locked it up in my room.
You good-for-nothing, let me in.
My soul depends on it— A thousand times good night.
But wait a minute, please.
Your Emperor is still a king among gods.
And don’t be proud.
Who was that?
Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time.
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan, but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband’s still alive.
ate at home, but the jeweler says he didn’t.
Informed them”?
Twenty crowns?
Varrus and Claudio!
First, I ask you what they’ve done; thirdly, I ask you what offense they’re charged with; sixth and lastly, I ask you why they’ve been committed here; and, in conclusion, I ask what they’re accused of.
him terribly.
We’ll be there, and there we’ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully, truly obscenely.
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from heaven.
If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place.
He’s thirty years old.
Tell us about the letters that you got from France.
Well, I’m going to break in.
They grow like savages—like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood—surrounded by swearing and stern looks, ragged clothing and everything unnatural.
Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye.
I’ll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother!
You stay on the left.
Lights, lights, get us some lights!
Go wake Juliet.
He’s got my vote as I die.
He got what he deserved.
You’d better get me  But does he know that I’m here in the forest and dressed in men’s clothing?
For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced it firsthand.
Mistress, you have to go see your father.
Wake up, sir, wake up.
Now come along.
How will we pass the time without some entertainment?    
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges: she doesn’t want to add perjury to her list of sins.
I’ll find Romeo to comfort you.
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here.
You’re not responsible for my death and my father’s, and I’m not responsible for yours.
I want this to provoke confrontations, so I can give him a piece of my mind.
From my house, if I had a house—” “The sixth of July.
You’re not being a good friend, Iago, if you even  Please don’t ask me to tell you.
Good morning to you both.
You lie.
How can it seem like I’m making fun of you, when my tears prove that I’m sincere?
He’s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour.
Let them marry your children!
Then why am I worried?
So be cheerful.
What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset.
The prince has far outgrown me.
I can hear the lark singing.
Is there any news about my husband?
As old and white-haired as you are, and you’re such a traitor?
O noble English, who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces, leaving the other half to stand by, idle and laughing.
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime, I can endure her death now.
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite?
Lock the doors, my lord.
And let the wise man run away.
But if you were married, you’d wield some influence.
Here, madam.
To tell you the truth, they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition.
I can’t say no.
With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds.
You may leave.
I have nothing to do with what you’re talking about, my lord.
The king has strictly forbidden it.
Here, my lord.
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments?
Oh, go away, you’re a boring fool.
It’s definitely Maria’s handwriting.
My lady Olivia’s inside, sir.
It was some devil.
Excuse me, sir.— Tom’s chilly.
Even if marrying her meant I died.
But my dear, when I said I was worth nothing, I was actually bragging—I should’ve said that I was worse than nothing.
Yes.
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind.
It’s the blessed sun.
I’ll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort.
Sir, pardon me for what I am about to say.
Look at this, here is the man—scarred, as you can see, by traitors. 
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
I led them on in this frightened, distracted state, and left sweet
No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff.
Who deserted this morning?
No, let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood.
She’s lying on the ground just like him, blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
But you’re no such man.
Now go, and hurry back.
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken.
I just speak directly.
Yes, you’re absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him.
That’s true.
I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest.
Oh my, my bones ache so much.
Let go of me.
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected.
Does she?
What time is it?
Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do.
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said, but to say what  I think there’s a lot of sense in what he says.
But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love.
What do you mean, do I think so?
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave!
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age.
Take a good look, and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester.
Will she go to bed now?
The king is not responsible for it.
Try again.
Yes, his chest!
I did kill her.
Oh, sir, you are too good at predicting the future.
Yes, that’s why you have to die.
You can speak to me.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you’ll find me in a grave.
The sound is going away.
May I speak, Caesar.
I’ve told you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick by you. 
Descend.
Yes, they have.
Tortured, 
Well then.
Cassio!
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter.
I’ll trust my determination and my hands, but none of Caesar’s men.
You will never fall victim to Benedick’s charms, my niece.
But before they reached us–let me say no more!
You and I cannot be held within the confines of a country’s arbitrary customs, dear Kate.
Read it instantly.
He doesn’t speak Latin, French, or Italian, and you know how little English I speak.
If she wants to be proud, or “honest,” as she calls it, she can just marry her own pride.
I used to love you.
Leave him alone.
It’s Hortensio, isn’t it?
I’ll never believe a madman until I can see his brains.
You mean an officer?
Fool, do not flatter yourself.
What does the silver one say?
May my wrinkles forbid that!
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead.
They are full of pity for Caesar.
I’d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun.
And if you rattle on about mountains, then let them throw millions of acres over us.
They would like me to be as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs, which goes against my manhood, because to take something from another’s pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing.
Come, let’s be off!
I didn’t do anything.
You, Nick Bottom, have been cast as Pyramus.
Go to the church: take the priest, the clerk, and some reasonably honest witnesses.
What didn’t you like?
Yes.
Good evening to your Worship, good Captain James.
Stop it, I order you.
And here comes the warden, just in time.
Rub his temples.
Live, Brutus!
And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones!
You are Dromio, you are my servant, and you are yourself.
Is that true?
Come here, Sir Andrew.
What’s the matter?
Let me work on him.
You’re lying.
But so what?
They’re forgiven, then, if they don’t see what they’re doing.
Listen!
You’re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else.
Come on, Balthasar, let’s hear that song again.
Now I must return to the wedding.
What happened, sir?
As I vowed, I will unite the York and Lancaster families.
It is.
Come on, boy.  
This may end without anyone getting killed. 
And so I’m dying.
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse.
He’s left them to you and to your heirs forever—public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax.
He’s a very proper man.
I’m torn.
You pale face!
Oh, except for the widow Dido?
We will, my lord.
Good morning, neighbor Gremio.
But you must not attract iron, because my heart is as true as steel.
Whoa, man, you dare to support someone who’s been proclaimed a traitor?
If your wife’s not a madwoman, and you tell her how much I deserve this ring, she won’t stay angry at you forever if you give it to me.
I have news from Rome, my good lord.
Go to bed right this minute.
What are you saying, mistress?
What do you want from me?
Yes, do you hear me, Balthasar?
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious.
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men, flattering them into turning Roman law into children’s games.
He won’t fight with me, Domitius?
Am I a married man or a bachelor?
I hate it and want all good men’s love.
Say something.
Good-bye.
Caesar has sent— Too slow a messenger.
The dog returns to its own vomit, and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle.” You’d take anything for a mistress.
I’ll back you up.
Yes, Celia, we kept her here for your sake.
I’ll tell you privately.
No doubt, my lord.
Then I’ll listen to her.
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair.
Yes, good fool.
My father’s dead, and his fortune is mine now.
And this is the man who has now become a god, and I’m a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way.
You will never be able to say the same about me.
Carry him to my best room—gently, so he doesn’t wake—and hang all my erotic paintings around him.
It will be as the gods see fit.
It’s a big prize for such a small sin.
Next he slung his arm around the bride’s neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo.
My library was a large enough dukedom for me.
Oh, on my soul, my cousin has been slandered falsely!
Yes, you did.
The whole town will riot!
Yes, God be praised, I have managed to earn his favor.
Did you find my daughter?
I’m telling you, just watch his face.
My good man Norfolk, hurry to your post.
Sure, to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest.
You can push my buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool.
Why are you so strong and good?
Where are my father and my mother, Nurse?
Not me.
Farewell till then.
Sometimes she tickles a priest’s nose with a  Enough, enough!
Am I sorry that I only had one child?
I’m coming in peace.
Oh, and monsieur, be careful not to break the honey-sac.
By my faith in love, I will, then.
You’re taking it more seriously than I meant it.
Come with me.
We’re near his room now.
And you’re right to do so.
The silk came from sacred silkworms, and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts.
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you’ve been ordered to stack!
Why not?
Then where would you have me go, Adam?
A husband?
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, is that what she says?
If this is a dream, let me keep on sleeping!
Some people in the street are crying “Romeo.” Some are crying “Juliet,” and some are crying “Paris.” They’re all running in an open riot toward our tomb.
I’m not competitive like Antony.
Yes, my lord.
You are right, it’s for my mistress.
What do you say, James  Well, I don’t know what to say.
And if we don’t shake hands, when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I’m happier to see them than you.
I’m losing this duel of wits.
Go ahead—say “Amen.” No more talking.
These lords seem so astonished that they’ve lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes.—But whatever the reason for your losing your senses, you can know for sure that I’m Prospero, that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed, and became the lord of it.
If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens will be our rulers.
Well, no, not literally.
Let Caesar do whatever he wants.
Your humor is a spicy sauce.
She’s dead to me.
A horse, a horse, I’d give my kingdom for a horse!
You’ve come to face a ruthless enemy, an inhuman wretch incapable of pity, without any feelings of mercy.
You’re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop.
They tell me he died well, and settled his scores.
Why, so did you.
Well, well, let’s go.
What do you mean by that?
Pay attention to the music.
And me too.
In Sicyon.
No, please good Meg, I’ll wear this one.
My Lord of Norfolk— Here, most gracious king.
What name, madam?
I’ll come at you with the old proverb: “Should I make myself at home?”  
He must do this, or I’ll recant the pardon I just delivered.
So be it.
Let’s proceed to the field.
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know.
My Cordelia, even the gods admire how much you’ve sacrificed for me.
No.
Call my guard, please.
I’ll write him a taunting letter, and you can deliver it.
Can’t you see for yourself?
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion, master of these servants, and queen over myself.
But, my good lord, the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself.
By eight o'clock.
Only when they’re dead can I start to count my gains.
Give me the letter.
Tomorrow I’ll send the messenger.
I’ll show you where to get fresh water.
Yes, if your memories do you no good.
Oh!
Poor man!
Mankind is so beautiful!
It doesn’t matter that I hit him first.
Yes!
Are you riding far?
Sir, I believe this piece of trash, Bianca, has something to do with all this trouble.—Hang in there, Cassio.—Come here, bring the light.
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch!
Goodbye, my lord.
Even for a  Good morning, lieutenant.
Look at you, standing there in a stupor!
Take me.
Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right.
You bastard!
Here’s someone coming in his pajamas, with a candle and weapons.
Tell her to put her mind at rest.
Oh, poor Romeo!
He’s written you a letter.
No, who are you talking about?
What do you say, my fair  I do not know dat.
It’s too much.
I know you for what you really are, but as your sister I’m reluctant to criticize you.
Time, you thwart my dreadful plans.
It wouldn’t hurt you to be charitable.
Me too, Lord!    
Edmund and I have talked, and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril.
There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his bravery, and death for his ambition.
I’m afraid that may be the case, madam.
While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here.
What are you thinking about so seriously?
Where is he?
Oh, how bitter it is that Edward—the real “true, noble prince”—should still be alive!
My brother thinks highly of you, and because of his affection, has helped arrange your marriage—but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy.
It’s a nice hand, an open one.
Oh God, Benedick will plague him like a disease!
How do you know?
So get prepared.
No, I don’t know you, and my lady didn’t send me to get you, and I’m not supposed to tell you to come speak with her, and your name is not Master Cesario, and this is not my nose, either.
What could you possibly ask for?
Is it possible?
I’ll be good, sir.
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today?
No, sir.
I’ll be at your service.
I met him in the street—he was there with that man.
And who is that?
Are the others waiting?
Are you rich?
I’m coming.
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor.
Which one will start yammering first, Gonzalo or Adrian?
I swear by this hand and my father’s soul, the whole thing is a disaster.
You’ve kept away from me for a week?
Wasn’t that letter from Jessica?
I see you’ve met with the jeweler.
But I’m still afraid.
You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do.
Me too, I won’t, I swear to God.
Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying.
Just listen this once.
But I swear I’m not the person I’m playing.
No, Cassio wasn’t killed.
Admit you were wrong.
Why are you leaving, my angry friend?
What are you thinking?
Hurry up, Robin, and make the night dark and cloudy.
I saw a thousand shipwrecks, a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone, huge anchors, chunks of gold, heaps of pearls, and precious jewels—all scattered on the bottom of the sea.
A pound of human flesh taken isn’t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef.
I beg your pardon, sirs.—Please tell me your name, sir?
What was the second noise for?
Oh, if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren’t working today.
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I’ll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow.
Go to Francis Seacole, the constable of the watch.
I’m sure I can answer for him—he doesn’t know any, either.
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt?
So go.
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you, and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me.
Romeo must die.
Take good care of him.
What fate is that?
No, I’ll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail.
So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John— And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will.
What’s the matter?
Good countrymen, let me leave alone.
I could find it in my heart to beat him— Come on, kiss my feet.
No medicine in the world can cure you.
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world, and has nothing to do with her property.
Because it doesn’t have eight?
Nothing?
He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him, but because you feared him.
It would be easier to do it in the dark.
I’m wide awake.
How can that be?
If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die.
Please, write down “Borachio.”—And yours?
You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before.
Come on, you’re being too hard on yourself.
Oh, that devious Egyptian spirit!
These are ugly antics.
We won’t take their garbage.
Will you come with me?
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life.
Isn’t she a well-mannered young lady?
Yes, yes, my lord.
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces?
My creditors are getting mean.
Hello, do you have any news?
You should know, my loving lord, I’ve heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany, to the earl of Richmond.
Get up, I tell you!
Not yet.” Well, the time has come.
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner?
Next month he’ll stay with us.
At the bottom, any change is for the better.
Many people have told me so.
We respected the beat of the song, sir.
We’re trying to be reasonable while you’re so upset, and we understand that you’re old, and… But Goneril knows what she’s doing.
I wish she were in her coffin here, with the ducats in her coffin!
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it’s gotten rolling?
I won’t break this promise.
I’ve acted like such a villain!
I gave you everything— And it was about time too.
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it.
Listen, listen!
What, he never made you laugh?
But when push comes to shove, they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl.
Stand still.
If I stay longer, I’ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying.
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison?
I’ll kill myself to save myself from slavery.
Ate at home?
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren’t willing to beat it back.
Let me shake your hand.
Corporal Nym, be a man and put away your sword.
Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them.
He did, and he snatched my ring right off my finger.
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock (as mine does) and bring you home on its own, without the need for a messenger.
You can see for yourself.
I beg you to continue to be patient.
If I’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this, whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish.
My friends, remember that you’re my guests here.
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees.
That’s true—if the devil’s judging her.
I’d rather be anything besides a fool.
I have to go.
This is a rotten song to sing at a man’s funeral.
And in a P.S.
I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother.
Who pays their way?
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping?
Yes, quite a large one, with many cells and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.
Hush, Hortensio.
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness.
This is what Calphurnia’s dream means.
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced?
So use your discretion.
I’m happy about that.
Everyone else will have to stay single.
I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world.
Listen to him talk about war, and you’ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles.
How are you doing, brother?
To that end, I presented him with the tennis balls, the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity.
Brother Anthony—
He’s evaded love once or twice, and since then Cupid doesn’t dare to shoot at him.
If they have done this thing, my noble lord— If?
What are your names?
Though I said my name was Benedick, I heard this news with Claudio’s ears.
Good-bye, kind Charmian.
A very candid reply.
How did you tolerate prison?
Only men whom you wouldn’t trust anyway would swear oaths, and for the worst reasons.
You gave us the slip, sir, the slip.
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he’s preparing for war.
If I miss this, let me be boiled alive.
I will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your forgiveness.
What’s this all about?
Oh, dear.
There’s something else.
Goodbye, old friend.
Oh, Antonio, I’m sorry I caused you so much trouble.
What, you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I’m warning you about?
That’s a nice hand you dealt me.
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her.
Who did this to him?
I’m your neighbor and came courting first.
Please pardon our brother Clarence.
And when that time comes, then you can mock me, but please don’t pity me, because I won’t pity you.  
Not the one I gave you, I hope.
Come, come, you weak, ungovernable worms!
Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church.
Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall!
You’re alive.
That’s him.
The more I suffer, the more spiteful he becomes.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Tell us.
I can’t blame her.
Shylock, they’re offering you three times the money you lent.
Then we’ll go out, even to the marketplace, and, waving our bloody swords over our heads, let’s cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Kneel then, and wash.
For God’s sake, Sir Toby, you’ve got to come home earlier at night.
Madam, please be patient.
Nice Grumio, bring me some.
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel?
I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard.
Your ear is good.
What’s the play called?
Let’s go find him and cheer him up.
Whatever has already been done can’t be undone now.
Is there more work to do?
I’ll torment them all till they roar with pain.
Take them away.
Please come closer.— Make the music louder, please!
I’ll put up my shield and battle you.
Where’s my son Edmund?
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for?
But please tell me, who’s his best friend?
Yes, with the sign underneath him that says: “Here lives Benedick the married man”?
But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife.
Your Juliet is alive.
Wait!
Gentleman, I am not the same man I was before.
Calphurnia’s face is pale, and Cicero’s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol.
Now, fellow, what have you got there?
And so you do.
The handkerchief!
My servants might overhear, and old Gremio is still hanging around, so we might be interrupted.
So order the armies to rest, and let’s go home to share the glories of this happy day.
Goodbye.
Ingratitude is always hideous, but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster!
But let him come.
God be good to you!
I hope not, Madam.
What’s done is done.
How do you feel, Laertes?
The Duke’s in a meeting right now, and he’s sent for you too.
You’ve lost your resolve.
We’re three of them.
They’ve switched their operation to the sea today.
What’s the matter?
How is your majesty doing?
You’re talking in such a crazy way, sir.
Here.
Thanks to your majesty.
Why?
Hastings loved the prince’s father so much that we won’t be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince.
Let me say “amen” quickly, before the devil comes in and stops my prayer—because here comes the devil, disguised as a Jew.
I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly.
I pray to God he isn’t.
My mind is too great for that.
Brutus, my lord.
Come on, tell me in broken music—for your voice is music and your English broken.
Where are you going?
Right in the middle of the fight, just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral Egyptian nag—May she die of leprosy!—suddenly became frightened, and turned her ships around and fled.
You must have figured out who I am.
Caesar hanged him for this service.
Not in my house, Lucentio.
So why does it seem so particular to you?
Let me at him.
Alas, you misunderstood everything!
And then return to you and nothing else?
I think I hear them.
I swear, somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money.
The queen is here on special business, and her army has moved on.
He hasn’t told this to the king, has he?
Go ahead.
Hail, king!
What’s this song?
Romeo will answer the challenge.
And you’re not to utter a syllable of Tranio’s name.
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina.
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn’t warmed himself with ale.
Yes, she saw me quite clearly.
There’s still a spot here.
Who’s shouting?
Please put up with my weakness.
Now I want her more than ever.
In any case, Antonio assured the duke they weren’t with Bassanio on his ship.
If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of 
Hitting his wife?
Crude slaves with greasy aprons, rulers, and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see.
What do you want, fellow?
An old Italian fox is never that generous, my boy.
My friend Antonio, all I can say is thank you.
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else.
I’m glad to see you go.
So, to answer your question.
Besides, his cottage, his flocks, and his grazing rights are on sale now, and since he’s not there, there’s nothing to eat at our house.
My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter.
Yes, and I’ll give it to him for free.
I’ll do anything you ask.
For her I’ll be strange and condescending, and I’ll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away.
The criminal is the one who stole the nest.
Dress me up in motley.
Is Clarence dead?
Therefore, the fact that you’re awake this early tells me you’ve been upset with some anxiety.
What heir of the York family is there alive other than myself?
Each of you, give me your bloody hand.
But did you see them dead?
What did I promise, my dear?
Yes, for three months.
Oh cousin, cousin, cousin, my sweet little cousin, I wish you knew how deep in love I am.
That’s what’s driving her crazy.
You gave an excellent performance.
You’re rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages.
No, not until we see a hot January.
I admit I’m only a woman, but I’m still a woman from a noble family—I’m Cato’s daughter.
You’ll never see me again, whether or not he’s dead.
I’ll join you, sir.
We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here.
Lead’s too crass to hold her.
If you can prove that I’ll ever be so in love that I can’t be brought to my senses with a good round of beers, you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet’s pen and hang me on a brothel’s door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes.
Would I dare do something like that?
I’ll go see my mother soon.
Will you do that for me, Silvius?
And to make it even clearer, we can tell them that I’m playing Pyramus but I’m not really Pyramus—really, I’m Bottom the weaver.
See the wound that Casca made.
While he was alive, I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies.
He looks calmer than he did before.
Carry me, good friends, to where Cleopatra is.
What, are we playing with interjections?
She’s alive.
Am I all alone?
Drink when I order you, servant-monster.
What’s his name?
Show him in.
I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this.
Are you scared?
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours?
Knock, knock, knock!
If you have me, you have me now at my worst; and if you have me, you’ll appreciate me better and better.
If we meet him at Philippi, these people will be at our backs.
We thought you ought to know about it.
To invite my former boss, the Jew, to dine tonight with my new master, the Christian.
I beg your pardon, sir— What did that guy say?
No, no, put your hat back on.
I’ll walk up and down and sing a song, so they’ll know I’m not afraid.
Leave me alone now, Iago.
That’s terrible!
Stanley, Richmond is your wife’s son.
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and impose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were my own son.
If you were as young as I am, if you were in love with Juliet, if you had just married her an hour ago, if then you murdered Tybalt, if you were lovesick like me, and if you were banished, then you might talk about it.
In the mud.
Don’t take my love for granted.
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck.
Why do you think I’m making fun of you when I tell you I love you?
I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant.
You’ve won the wager, and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you.
Well, that turned out well in the end.
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it.
There are ten thousand— Geese, you idiot?
Is he talking nonsense?
She’s dead, my Queen.
A wise man and a fool.
Isn’t that what he said?
Though science can explain them away, disasters still come after eclipses.
Where, sir?
Here’s a goat for you.
And those who leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men though buried in your dunghills—they’ll be remembered, too.
Why, then, it’s my body’s doomsday.
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her?
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught.
Your praise has beaten you home.
Look, here comes Cassio and my husband.
If I know my own thoughts and desires, and I’m not dreaming or crazy—which I’m sure I’m not—then, dear uncle, I’ve never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you.
Oh, proud Death, what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke?
What are they doing on the road?
What role did you play?
Follow that gentleman now, and be careful not to make fun of him.
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare.
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage?
There’s a picture of me inside.
If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here.
Let’s go back to our bedroom.
And even then, in order for me to catch the fly your cousin, she must be blind?
So good night to everyone.
Dear God, please make him normal again!
He was an admirable king.
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn’t want to be a Roman?
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud, just like the crocodile.
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes, I can tell you who’d be on the ground.
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show, though he now lies at the base of Pompey’s statue, as worthless as dust!
I thank you, Sir John, with all my heart.
It is for your ears only.
If you were ever yourself, and this sadness was yours, you and your sadness were all for Rosaline.
As a wandering lunatic, he can do whatever he wants.
Who sent you here?
Not very well, but I’ve met him several times.
But if you remember, I didn’t tell you to parody the style.
But let’s see once more what the gold one says: “He who chooses me will get what many men want.” That’s Portia!
You’re wrong to kill me for loving you.
My lord, his throat is cut.
My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion.
I’m not afraid of anyone but him.
What’s up, man?
I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do.
I scolded you for obsessing about her, not for loving her, my student.
Oh, I’m dead!
Madam!
I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt.
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship.
Well then, God forgive me!
Good.
What are you saying?
Listen to this, King: as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover, the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons.
We’ll watch them starve to death first.
But you see my finger doesn’t have the ring on it.
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar.
I mean a husband.
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore.
Farewell, kind master.
They’re speaking to him.
What’s going on, Dromio?
I’m finished.
Is it true that good King Edward has died?
He is called Ensign Pistol.
Now he’s a little crooked.
I could really use his advice right now.
Let’s be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.
My husband is alive on earth, my vows of marriage are in heaven.
Yes, my lord.
Why, a bad action is just a wrong in this world, but when you’ve won the whole world, it’s a wrong in your own world, so you can make it right then.
Mine, neither.
She’s cheating on me?
But that would ruin his reputation!
No, by our Lady, I don’t think he can.
My dream told me that dreamers often lie.
She has betrayed me and shall die.
She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him.
I don’t know, madam.
I hope she doesn’t have a crush on me!
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal, I had tears in my eyes—but they were tears of laughter.
My noble brother!
Go wisely and slowly.
Lovers, it’s time to go to bed.
I changed my mind.
But since Laertes is better, we’ve given him a handicap.
You’re a man with a good reputation.
Welcome, my friends.
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
I doubt it.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Take up the body.
Look how they kiss and carry on!
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon.
Must I bite?
We can all go together.
You coward, did you run away from me?
Yes, the leader of the team; the one that gets you if you can’t pay a debt; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them, “Have arrest.” Well, sir, stop your joking there.
Let them last forever.
A man’s virtues will always show themselves, and that’s the end of that.
It’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us.
Come, husband, let’s go to lunch.
Come, Dromio, let’s go.
That counts for everything.
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living, breathing saint.
Is it because of 
Since you are a lying hypocrite, we must look after you.
The king has bet six Barbary horses, and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories.
Hey, Mountain, hey!
Oh God of battles, bolster my soldiers' courage.
I’ll leave you without revealing any emotion, like a man of steel. 
Don’t spend any more time here.
Get out of my sight!
And if anything important happens, find me and let me know.
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support.
You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells my ruin.
My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow.
Go wherever you want.
Then tomorrow at dinner?
I myself am the King of Naples, since I saw with my own eyes—these eyes that haven’t been dry since—my father killed in a shipwreck.
I was killed in the Capitol.
I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to.
Go then, slave.
Farewell!
Let me see, let me see.
Your heart’s going to break.
That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools.
Just looking at you makes me sick.
If I’d been a common laborer and hadn’t taken him up on his offer, to hell with me.
That’s like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses.
Within three hours Juliet will wake up.
Whom you swore you would protect and defend.
Yes, my lord.
There are rats and thieves and pirates—not to mention storms, winds, and rocks.
The owl made noise all night.
I hope he is, but mothers get to have their doubts.
Don’t say that, my lord.
This is a sleepy tune.
Their bodies may remain here in England, but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already.
I’ll always be loyal to you, sir.
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death.
Come on, let’s put him in a dark room and tie him up.
Or else their guardians and advisors said no— What hell, to have your love life determined by someone else!
What do you want?
He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” That’s nicely put—because who’s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves?
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder—that was your idea of heaven.
If you really love me, you’ll find me.—Nerissa and the rest of you, get away from him.
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia.
He needs to see you right away.
Come here, Ariel.
The life”?
He goes forth to war bravely.
Am I your servant?
Let’s hope we never need your help for anything.
No!
Do you know me?
Are you going to Scone?
Come on, put your sword away, my little soldier.
I’ll fix you, I swear.
I learned to do this from you. 
It’s my exercise time.
Well, it’s a fault I wouldn’t trade for your best virtue.
I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off!
That would be a little extreme!
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds!
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results.
Why, wouldn’t you?
If she glares, I’ll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew.
When you have said your lines, go hide in that bush.—Everyone else, go there too when you’re not onstage.
This is healthy talk.
I’ll try to make myself worth your knowledge.
That doesn’t matter.
But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?
Here comes the lady.
And, if you need to, approach the subject of me: tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward, my noble father was fighting in France.
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection.
Your lord knows what I think.
Sir, my brother is very fond of you.
Please hear what Goneril is saying.
That sounds like the voice of Friar John.
A snail?
God save the charitable organization!
I swear, before I die I’m going to see you sick with love.
Wasn’t Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
My God, who knows?
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome.
The things men are allowed to do!
I’ll lock up the doors, grab some more ducats, and be with you right away.
You were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly, a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body.
Only Antony was at fault.
Why, isn’t all this joking better than groaning about love?
I’m glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you.
Friends of this country.
Neither good nor bad.
I’m not here.
Was it you that he rescued?
But I’ll get you a candle and paper and ink.
To tell the truth, though, I think the duke hasn’t lost a single man, except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph—I don’t know if your Majesty knows the man.
I swear, at the moment I really couldn’t tell you how I ended up here.
What is his name?
Let him be the devil if he wants to, I don’t care.
My lord, he refuses to come.
Just know this before I begin: I can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note.
Let’s go, then!
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man, but he was always my enemy.
Tell me anything you remember.
I curse him, but he loves me.
I’d better stop up my ears against this siren’s song.
Oh, I’m dying of hunger.
As moral as me!
To this day, the kings of France follow this unspoken rule, even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line.
Not that I know of.
If Caesar chose, Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend.
No, my lord, unless I could have another husband for the work week.
We don’t want it at our festivities.
What do you mean, the seventh cause?
We’ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us.
What’s your profession?
Well, then, I thank you, though I’m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much.
Therefore, great king, we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy.
There’s certainly not a boy left alive, and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle.
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus—your ancestor—who would’ve let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule.
Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut.
That’s the next thing on the agenda.
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little.
That’s me.
Do you acknowledge the contract?
It will give you some protection from this storm.
The moon has set.
Goneril, you aren’t worth the dust the wind blows in your face.
They’re out to get me, and I won’t stand for it!
Why, so did you.
If you hang around me for two more years, you’ll forget the sound of your own voice.
Come out, I order you.
And you, sir, what’s  Well, compared to a fine workman, you might call me a mere cobbler.
What can I say?
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke.
I won’t wrong any of my friends, because I don’t have any to mourn for me, and I won’t have wronged the world, because I don’t have anything in the world.
No, taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it.
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye, madam.
Claudio!
Well, I’m glad that everything has been sorted out.
I shook you and shouted at you, sir.
Don’t get wound up, my good man.
I’ve heard my father mention him.
Well then, Margaret, Ursula, and my cousin have been very much deceived, for they swore you did.
Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me.
My old brain is troubled.
Then don’t move while I act out my prayer.
I admit I’m only a woman, but nevertheless I’m the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife.
This is amazing.
May the gods destroy you!
I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine.
Bring me some light, gentlemen, I’ll bind the wound with my shirt.
I have a ship full of treasure.
Do you hear me?
His feelings don’t move in that direction.
Did he beg my pardon?
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one.
Give me one kiss, and I’ll go down.
Besides, I have some business to take care of in town.
I don’t know what to say.
Tell me what you want.
M”—why, that’s the first letter in my name.
Go now and get cash.
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well, without owing my master anything.
And Cassius too.
And I think she’s at least thirty.
I’m serving under him to take advantage of him.
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss.
And you say he’s not jealous?
Yes.
I’ve changed my mind about that.
My royal kinsman, are you teaching our princess English?
Until that happens, let me be who I am and don’t try to change me.
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
May God choose you to receive his grace.
My lord?
Good-bye, sir.
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor, naked, two-legged animal like you.
So tell me, Grumio, how goes the world?
I’d like to think all men have some hope.
The guilty speak volumes even when they’re silent.
Well, other men have bad luck too.
You’ve done well at sea.
Let’s go.
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower, as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse.
Who?
He’ll tell them so.
If we don’t obey them, they’ll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue.
Do I ask you to follow me?
What have I said in my grief?
So good-bye for now.
Come on, let’s get to the banquet.
Poor Tom will take you there.
So the lion disappeared.
Enough to buy everything you have declared.
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect, but not with affection, nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me.
I didn’t see anybody use you for kicks.
Let go of me!
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee, but can you take possession of his health?
And as surely as I am alive, I am a virgin.
Good morning to both of you.
No.
If not, you can kill me.
Here are my keys.—But why should I go?
Will you have me?
My freedom.
I am ready for you.
Try being sick, great greatness, and see if ceremony can cure you!
Not for your entire fairy kingdom.—Come, fairies, let’s go.
As long as hell and Richard want it.
You might just as well say, “That’s a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion.” Yes, exactly.
My lord, I will help you, even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight.
Let me see.
What, from myself?
Where did they disappear to?
I don’t know, sir.
Isn’t that the reason you told me all this?
Weren’t you banished on pain of death?
Give me your hand.
No, if they try to lead us to harm, I will leave the dance floor at the next song.  
What news?
I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis!
Excuse me.
At five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it.
Let’s go greet him when he lands.
This toast is for Lepidus!
I’ll pay you.
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress.
Do that, my friend.
He’s just Launcelot.
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking?
Listen, Hortensio.
And that’s all there is to it.
Then if he dies, his death serves him.
Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.” I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
You would take it back?
You know that the style of a man’s jacket or hat or coat means nothing.
Farewell, sir.
I spoke angry, foul words to him, and with that I will kiss you.
Love each other and be friends, like two such men should be.
She will not come.
No, no, I can’t, really.
I took your hands in friendship, but, indeed, I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar.
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well, and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things.
She’s a good little woman, and she adores me.
I’ll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part.
I’ll pull on these smaller legs.
I hope I enjoy wearing it, for my heart is very heavy.
What a day this is!
Don’t put me in the stocks.
Here we’ll shake hands good-bye.
Go find him, please, and bring him to my tent.
We’ll do it.
But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic.
But I surrender all this magic now, when I’ve summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell, as I’m doing now, I’ll break my staff and bury it far underground, and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank.
No more talk about my father; you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days.
Goodbye, Jessica.
You don’t think you can teach her?
Therefore, every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do: clear his conscience of any stain.
No, come on, one more time.
Are you going to watch the race?
For God’s sake, find a house to duck into.
No, don’t pause, because I 
And mine say two hundred.
Didn’t they ever whisper?
I can’t remember how I cried then, but I’ll cry all over again.
No, I’m not wound up.
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire, and they are coming after to warm themselves.
Oh, there’s the problem.
Stay here.
So, I won’t.
Is this servant of yours a smart man?
Your two sons?
The king wants to speak with Cornwall.
Even  What, were you all snarling before I arrived, ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs, but now that I’m here, you turn your hatred toward me?
Early in the morning we’ll both rush to Belmont.
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—Trumpets, blow!
Your Honor’s is unhealthy talk.
We’re available.
I don’t know what to say.  
Tell him he’s not going to speak with me.
I swear he’s the better dog.
Invite all my sad captains.
Not many, and no one important.
Good question, my girl.
It’s the lark that sings so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
The king rode out alone to view their troops.
I’d give it all up—yes, I’d sacrifice them all to this devil here—to save you.
And I departed in a rage, right?
crowned by the golden sun, observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature, French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years, since they were babies.
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles, your hat flying off your head, your sleeves unbuttoned, your shoes untied, and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery.
The court has sent for us.
You’ll both help me, right?
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully.
There’s nothing else.
I could go around the world in forty minutes.
Wholeheartedly, good young man.
Ah, the countess is coming!
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable.
The prince has done neither; therefore, in my opinion, he isn’t really protected by sanctuary.
I loved one speech in particular.
If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.
Good night then, Casca.
The door’s right here.
What infinite peace do king’s give up that private men enjoy?
Last night she got no sleep, and she won’t get any tonight.
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others' tools, that fisherman should play with paints, and painters should play with with fishing nets.
As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done.
No.
Your husband.
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you?
And her sister’s dead too, poisoned by your wife.
True,” she said, “a fine little one.” “No,” I said, “a huge wit.” “Right,” she said, “a hugely awful one.” “No,” I said, “he has a good wit.” “Exactly,” she said, “it’s good and mild; it doesn’t hurt anyone.” “No,” I said, “Benedick is wise.” “He is certainly,” she said,  She cried a lot at that, and said she didn’t care.
Good sir, calm down.
Thank you, madam.
The woman I love is beautiful.
But in this way, grief and comfort appear together.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Dorset, embrace Hastings.—Hastings, express your affection for the marquess of Dorset.
How is that possible?  
I can do anything!
He just said that they’re no good at acting.
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows.
After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits?
And what an excellent piece of work it is, too, madam lady!
Hello, sir.
I don’t trust you.
So what if I killed her husband and her father?
I mean when I wore it at your daughter’s wedding.
Why, what a complicated case this is!
Take my remark in whichever sense you like.
I don’t like sports.
But let me place this wreath on your head.
Here’s my servant.
I don’t know.
Agreed.
Yes, thoroughly.
Why, sweetheart?
You’re welcome here.
Curse my father’s ambition!
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl.
I’m not sure it’s true, but just the suspicion is enough for me.
What’s that?
He  I can’t tell what’s going on.
My eyes itch—is that an omen I’ll be crying soon?
That’s burglary, that is.
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does.
I’ll put the juice of this flower on Titania’s eyes, and fill her with horrible delusions and desires.
It’s a lot to ask of a maiden.
Myself?
At least tell me where you’re going.
It’s your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins.
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence.
If you say that, you’ll only be telling the truth.
He’s dead and rotting in the dirt now.
Ha!
The East is very seductive.
Where’s the Master?
We’ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back.
A crow without feathers?
Good morning, Prince; good morning, Claudio.
I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave.
It’s better here than outside.
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria.
Good Volumnius, you know that we went to school together.
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief.
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely?
But tell me seriously who it is.
Look, here it is.
I’ll be there early.
You’ll “never trust his word again.” Come on, that was a stupid thing to say.
Come on, you.
Has it been so long?
Give it to me.
What about it?
Ran off with a Christian!
Damn that Toby!
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
He might have treated me like that, because I’m as unused to abuse as a little child.
I’ll stay, my lord.
She’ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her.
If you were the noblest of your family, young man, you couldn’t die more honorably.
Uncle, I’m coming out!
Is her voice pitched high or low?
My poor husband, my dear Edward!
Well, should we head to the Tower?
For no man, sir.
Really?
Your lily-white lips, your cherry-red nose, and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone, gone forever.
Oh, you should have done it without telling me!
Now we can shout, “Congratulations, congratulations, my lord and lady!” My Lord Bassanio, and my dear lady, I wish you all the joy I can wish for.
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose.
Bring me this plant, and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles.
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands.
Knock, sir?
Cassio’s been wounded.
He and I will be there.
Because you’re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell—you keep interrupting my thoughts.
Because their business lies outside the home.
Take a little vacation in Mantua.
I’m dying an innocent woman.
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened.
What does this say?
You kiss like you’ve studied how.
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea, singing loudly, wearing a crown of nettles, thorns, hemlock, and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields.—Send out a hundred soldiers to find him.
I’ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies.
Be patient with him, Brutus.
Speak, man.
Take away this fool, gentlemen.
What if I went no further and chose this one?
That’s Claudio.
Don’t hurt me.
He says that for Brutus’s sake he finds himself indebted to us all.
Good night to you both.
Good!
and affection, even if it’s just an act.
More and more light.
Be patient, because you’re staying with me.
Anyone who says you’re a man must not notice how young you are.
Why are you talking about robbery?
Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?
He did touch on women a bit, but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon.
Here comes the Duke now.
A gentleman.
But the really unbelievable thing is—and this is incredible— As most unbelievable things are.
Wrong, evil traitor.
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them.
If the Jew cuts deep enough, I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.
Oh, I wish I were a man!
Sir Toby needs help right away.
It makes me mad.
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love.
Keep an eye on her.
I’ll die  You’re of royal blood, and we obey you.
Husband, I’ll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you’ve pulled.
Meanwhile, I’ll make a list of props that we’ll need for the play.
Wait for mine, sweet soul.
You there, sir, come here please.
Where’s Potpan?
Said what, sir?
Just say it.
Your children caused you trouble in your youth, but mine will bring you comfort in your old age.
I couldn’t see you, Lysander, but I heard your voice, and that’s how I found you.
I’ll be with you right away.
Claribel, his daughter.
Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms.
The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable.
Oh, royal Caesar!
Leave him to my wrath.—Edmund, go with my sister-in-law.
Is Fleance going with you?
By this sword” is an oath, and oaths must be kept.
Good shining, Moon!—Really, the Moon shines very well.
You’re the one I have to obey.
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now.
A worthy fool!
I’ll bite my thumb at them.
I’ll have nothing to do with you.
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.
He’s rushing on his way here right now, and Regan’s with him.
He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine.
Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts.
He seems cheerful.
I’m not such an idiot that I can’t keep my hands dry.
Do you have anything else to tell me?
She’s a virtuous and holy lady.
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers, and you wouldn’t give it to me.
Strato, you’ve slept this whole time.
But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.
Can you blame him?
Oh, let her live, and I’ll ruin her manners and her beauty.
Oh, will it never be day?
If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him.
That’s the way of the world.
Hello, sir.
Tell her that the king, who has the power to command people, asks her.
He is definitely not there, sir.
What do you mean by “furniture”?
I was afraid this would happen, because he was a noble, brave man, but I didn’t think he had a weapon.  
O flesh, flesh, you’ve turned pale and weak like a fish.
But sir, there is no such house, no such maid, and no such men as you have dreamed up, like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece, a Peter Turph, one “Henry Pimpernell,” and twenty more men of this sort—who never actually existed.
The wildest animal isn’t as cruel as you are.
What’s this noise?
Would you mind if we woke up the king?
Come on, please sing.
I’ll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger.
You were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything.
Take my sword.
I’ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me!
We’re friends!
I’ll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us.
Seyton!—I’m sick at heart when I see—Seyton, come here!—This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne.
And to you, good sir.
You should know this: much luck is on my side, and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island.
Come with me now, and help me out.
So cheer up, there’s still hope for you, man.
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you.
I should go to the barber’s, monsieur, because I think I’m getting really hairy around the face.
There she is, over there.
I hope not.
Now, Brutus, you have only yourself to thank.
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta.
Wait, don’t stand next to each other.
Look at me now!
Yes, and one other place, if you’ll only let me name it.
Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage.
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you.
And bring the ship’s captain to the castle.
I’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding.
God alive!
Everything’s out of control.
It’s dark, like my shoe.
Oh yes, I heard them all, and more, too.
I can’t even be sure these are my hands.
I hope they don’t attack us now.
I’m ready now.
If I’m not mistaken, that’s Portia’s voice.
We will wait on you, your majesty.
There’s hardly a bush for miles around.
Oh, I wish you weren’t, you poor, frightened soul.
Where have you been hiding?
Yes, I swear.
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned?
How did we manage to get ashore?
Shall I come down?
I’ll come see you right away.
I hear some noise.
Let him mount the pulpit.
I hate my name, dear saint, because my name is your enemy.
No.
Eat and sleep.
No, before!
He’s without equal!
I don’t know.
I know the real reason.
Calm down.
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy.
Thank you, dear Nurse.
If this letter falls into your hands, think carefully about what it says.
If I break the door down, slave, you’ll be sorry for this.
Yes, you already hurt me in the church, in the town, and in the fields.
But what about the bloody handkerchief?
It was armed, you say?
Father, go ahead.
Priest.
Is the Prince’s punishment any less awful than doomsday?
I don’t like her name.
Don’t you know that I’m a woman?
Brutus, do not provoke me.
I’ll do as you say, father.
Dromio, you drone, you snail, you slug, you idiot!
Now, most noble Brutus, the gods are friendly with us today so that we, who want peace, can live on to old age!
Are you good at those kinds of things?
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good.
Are you talking about Caesar?
I don’t like what you’re asking me to do.
Go ahead.
He speaks roughly, but what he says is smart, and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him.
I never saw such a shameful act.
Do you want to go in and join the party?
Babbling senselessly?
No one except her maid and a holy hermit.
Well, then, help me.
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin.
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it, and deserved it too.
Bridegroom?
That’s the curse of military service.
If you’re joining together to right these wrongs, I’ll go as far as any one of you.
I recognize your face perfectly, even without a sailor’s cap on your head.—Take him away.
I’m satisfied.
But I’ll open the curtain and let you see the picture.
Come on, you can go.
Master Fer!
All right, sir, I will.
He taught me how to recognize a man in love, and you’re not a prisoner of love, I’m sure.
There is a way, ma'am.
My brother whom—aside from you—I loved more than anyone else in the world, I trusted to run my state, which at that time was the strongest in the land, and Prospero the number one duke, famous for my dignity and my education.
Meet with the ambassadors.
So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear.
We’re ready if our minds are ready.
Draw your sword, scoundrel.
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio.
Bring your master home.
And that’s how she died?
She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore.
Or thorn-bushes.
Look who’s here!
Here.
Very near, and approaching fast.
No, I’m telling you, put on this robe and beard.
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction?
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn’t even arrived to tell us whether they’re coming!
Not even one success?
I’ll poison you, or beat you with a club, or stab you with a sword.
More or less.
Let’s go, Tom.
How are you, Roderigo?
But don’t be easily won over.
How can you test them like that?
Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me.
So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer.
What do you have to say to me?
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that’s about to pour out its contents.
My dear Caius, I’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to.
Enobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous gifts besides.
Pardon my crime, sovereign, but not my person.
Every one of us is a criminal.
You were never with me for anything if you weren’t there for the goose.
We’re not getting any younger.
Let Rome fall!
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper.
What?
I hope he’s grown a lot since I last saw him.
But I reversed the death sentence.
Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”?
Come with me, sir.
He has a very gloomy attitude.
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs.
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world?
That guy’s funny.
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance, then I’ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly.
They’re just fine, my dear madam.
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him.
Are you going to start eating worms and flies?
Your answer is so strange!
Let me tell
Oh, was she now?
If you who are so wise can’t help, please be kind enough to call my solution wise. 
Lorenzo, please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back.
You’ll be my witness that I’ve been forced, as Pompey was, to wager all of our freedoms on one battle.
I tell you, I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream.
Welcome.
How is my generous sister?
If not, I’ll challenge you to a duel.
If you leave like this, my dear, I won’t ever use my sword again.
And look how he’s repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty—penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter.
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime?
The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more.
Tell him not to send any more messengers—unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news.
Can you do that?
What is my nation?
Good day to both of you.
Otherwise I would have been perfect, as solid as a piece of marble, as firm as a rock, as free as the air itself.
What’s the news with you?
No.
I agree— Put a mark next to his name too, Antony.
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia?
Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea.
His beard was gray, right?
I’m afraid he will.
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs.
Therefore, drink up.—Servant-monster, drink a toast to me.
I did that to him.
I’m left with nothing to do in this weak, idle peacetime, unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about 
As you can see, these lovers are looking for a place to fight.
But don’t do that.
Since you’re giving me new assignments, let me remind you what you promised me but haven’t come through with yet.
Not that we love words more than fighting, like you do.
But I need to remember I’m related to him by blood, not behavior.
What’s going on?
Only Adam, Rafe, and Gregory were ready.
This is Illyria, lady.
We’ll leave you here. 
Goodbye, Launcelot.
Help, help, oh, help!
My voice is ragged.
It’s hell in our house, and you helped cheer it up, like a funny devil.
Well, God bless this marriage!
Yes Signior?
Remember to see me today.
Do you know where I’m going?
I need a doctor.
Who’s that?
So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy.
A nice coincidence, my lord.
Farewell.
In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other, more serious matters that concern you.
What, there’s going to be a masquerade?
Yes, madam.
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt?
They say that this town is full of deception—illusionists that can fool the eye, dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind, soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body, disguised swindlers, fast-talking fakers, and all kinds of other unchecked sins.
Why, anyone can see what this means.
Brother— Quiet.
Why did you send so many?
He is, because he told Antonius to tell you he’d be there tomorrow.
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it.
You won’t regret this.
You’re smiling?
You’d better not make that suggestion, Agrippa.
Until you get back, Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows.
I insist, don’t be more distressed than I am.
I don’t think there’s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government.
But honestly, I should have been a woman.
It’s strongest in the strongest people.
Good and noble young man, don’t mess with someone who’s desperate.
Madam, I’ve come here to try to make you like him.
We’ll watch a whole play tomorrow.
Where’s he going?
But I made an oath, an oath, an oath in heaven.
But Miranda is so much more beautiful, you can’t even compare the two.
I’ll catch it before it falls to the ground.
It will be made even heavier soon—by the weight of a man.
Is Othello angry?
My lady Olivia, your niece, disapproves of your late-night partying.
We’re overjoyed to see you sane again.
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it.
I recognize something about that voice.
Oh, my dear mistress, I won’t be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest.
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king.
Go ahead, you fool.
Goodbye.
What?
The partygoers have arrived.
I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead.
From down here, I thought his eyes looked like full moons.
I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it.
He’s certainly crossed the river Somme.
And in the morning I’ll take you to your ship and we’ll sail to Naples, where I hope to see this loving couple married.
Listen, will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn?
Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind.
Oh, that was unbelievably low!
Who do you want to work for?
Where are you, Demetrius, you arrogant bastard?
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life.
Sir John Falstaff.
Oh, if only I were a man!
Give me my robe, because I’m going.
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then, I ask you for justice now.
Don’t damn yourself.
Pronounce them—it is just as nice to say.
Prepare yourself, please, for this trip.
May God’s blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good, and enemies into friends!
I’ve left our luggage on the ship, and I bought the oil, balm, and liquor you wanted.
Come, put it over my face. 
Oh Cassius, I’m tired out by many sorrows.
You’ll be pricked all over, and it’ll sting like bees.
So you’d better not stay with him, Antony.
No, not too upset.
Noble Mercutio, put your sword away.    
Listen to me, because I’m older than you, surely.
Oh, wait, sir.
You are their heir and sit on their throne, and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins.
We don’t doubt it.
Well that’s good.
Go back to bed.
Get to the point now.
It’s my daughter!
Then sing it.
Yes, they are.
No, my good lord.
I ask you, if you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so.
Bless your heart.
What do you think?
Always give him his way.
Be happy that you’re alive.
The Moor’s killed my mistress!
Tell me, so I can cut it out of myself. 
You’ll have wine enough, my lord, soon.
Now please go in.
If that’s the case, tears wash my eyes more than hers.
You’re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised.
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless.
I wish I had two fool’s caps and two daughters.
I tell you, you can use it to get your shoes fixed.
Then that’s the way it may turn out.
man’s cheeks.
Where are his eyes?
Oh, how strange!
Add defiance to all this and, by way of conclusion, tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him, whose death sentence has been pronounced.” My king and master’s message delivered, my task is done.
We’re still just beginners when it comes to crime.
Caesar?
Listen, Dardanius.
When the barrel’s empty, we’ll drink water.
I’ll do so.
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much.
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape.
Amen.
Sir, here’s the Queen.
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester, where, if you’d like, we can retreat to.
With those plays in mind, we hope you’ll receive this one kindly.
How do you do, sir.
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature.
He knows I recognize him.
He’s furious because you insulted him, and he has a right to satisfaction.
Pay attention.
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt.
Good day to you, Captain Fluellen.
Did you plan Cassio’s death with him?
Let’s go forth, dear countrymen.
If I know nothing about pity, that must mean I’m not an animal.
Portia is dead.
Oh, one child is one too many!
No, Kate?
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit, and I’ll have fun there forever.
So let me be brief here.
Let those who will hear me speak stay.
Have you heard something of her in your letters?
With whom?
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen?
We You won’t pay for the glasses you smashed?
Sometimes snakes wrap around me, hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy.
Grandmother, this would have been a biting joke.
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people.
He’s more of a soldier than a wise man.  
But how long will her beautiful life last?
Cassius, go to the next street and divide the crowd.
Do so.
Tonight I’m having a feast that we’ve celebrated for many years.
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes, and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon.
That’s a good point.
I’ll be right here, silent.
Grumio, get me my horse.
Give him your arm.
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, Vitruvio’s widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, My fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
Let’s look in his pockets.
Get them in here.  
He said she was unfaithful?
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss.
Oh Nerissa, my poor little body is tired of this great big world.
Oh, I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens!
And on their graves, I trust, the story of this day’s work will be written in brass.
When they choose, they only know how to lose.
Accept it in body and spirit.
God will protect me.
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark.
I’ve told her father, and he’s given his permission.
Alas, he is too young.
If it’s for me, don’t keep it from me.
Stay in the dark.
What proof is there?
Emilia, go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened.—Will you please go now? 
Answer when I call your name.—Nick Bottom, the weaver?
A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance.
In that case, if I can wear a mask, let me play Thisbe too!
I’ll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does, despite his youth and manliness.
Go, go, good countrymen, and to make up for having done wrong, gather up all the poor men like yourselves, lead them to the Tiber, and weep into the river until it overflows its banks.
I beg you, turn away and cry for her.
Whenever they meet, there’s a little battle.
Do your job.
Kate, my wooing is fit for your understanding: I am glad your English isn’t better.
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” You’d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you.
No, my lord.
The princes left your daughter here for dead.
You’d better shut up!
I hope what she’s saying is well, sir!
Pay for something I never got?
Hurry now, get the job done.
I admit two sleeves.
So prepare to die.
Indeed, he’s not right for this.
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins.
The Lord Grandpré.
I’m telling you this story for a reason.
Well, then, here it is: you must prepare yourself for his knife.
So can I.
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome.
Cassius, don’t take it badly.
Please, sir, be patient.
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first, so let me drop.
No, you’d answer, “The slaves are ours.” And that’s just how I’m answering you.
Madam, he’s well.
Just now we put him in the abbey over here, and now he’s over there.
Go ahead.
What’s your name, please, friend?
Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate, and together with some others they’ve set off for Dover, where they claim to have powerful friends.
What a backward world we live in!
She  I can guess her answer.
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her.
Saints don’t move, even when they grant prayers.
Where are they?
If you got what you deserved, you would learn some respect.
Just a moment.
If it’s work for a man, I’ll do it.  
Then I’ll pay you for doing what you like.
And who are you, good sir?
What business is it of yours?—Father, be quiet.
It isn’t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw, cold morning.
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved, with her children dead before their time.
Here is the cap your Worship ordered.
Yet I wish I could.
Words before fighting.
For God’s sake, let me hear it.
God bless you.
Why did you leave the dining room?
That, stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, he’s coming to England to claim the crown.
No, that I don’t remember.
Don’t follow me.
Where did you learn that song, Fool?
Ranting and raving to my own shadow!
I don’t like your faults.
Why didn’t I just adopt a beggar’s child left at my doorstep, whose shame and dishonor I could have denied, not being its true father?
If Cleopatra heard you, you would be well punished for your audacity.
Come on, don’t quarrel with us, good old man.
You had this child with the help of heaven.
Here, Peter Quince.
Let me see them.
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions.
Who’s that?
The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s.
My uncle the king is to blame for this.
Norfolk, we’re going to have a few blows, right?
Oh, for God’s sake.
Thank you.
If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.
It’s only four o'clock now.
I’ll have to tell the story again every month, since you seem to forget it.
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion, could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions, “I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman’s.” How you have poisoned my faith in people!
Come, here’s some sauce to go with it.
In order to make your company even more enjoyable, I’m going to keep to myself until suppertime.
The citizens are around, and Tybalt is dead.
Let’s go find that hussy, Fortune, and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally.
How’s the night going, boy?
Most sweet lady— Oh, “sweet”!
He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants.
She can’t even imagine what “love” is.
Don’t speak any further.
Musicians, come in!
I’ll take no lesser name than that of  Something that refers to my current state.
It’s my best option: I can’t afford to lose forty ducats.
His father, if I do say so myself, is an honest but very poor man, and, thank God, likely to live a long time.
What else?
And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me.
Oh, my!
I think so too.
Oh, I’ll beat him up for that!
And I will spend our time apart on my knees, praying for you.
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet.
Calm down, Kate.
Come with me.
He’s fainted!
Oh, holy Friar, Oh, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady’s husband?
Where are you from?
Kill Claudio.
She is worse than wicked.
But I’ll see you soon.
No, please, save it for dinner conversation.
No, not at all, sir.
Are you sad about that?
Yes, and the best looking too.
No, it wasn’t.
Then he’s no good.
You’re mistaken about all that.
Borachio.
Now, though, in all of Rome, there’s room for only one man.
Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours, anyone would believe you?
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him!
Bassanio told him he’d try to hurry back.
I’m sorry to find you like this.
My lord, I’ll do it right away.
There isn’t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love.
But he’d been there before me, and they told me he’d gone out looking for me.
Why are they running away?
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
Can you tell me?
Let’s move.
That’s the way it goes.
Who’s winning?
That’s me, sir.
She gave up her life with your name still within her.
Arm myself?
Even their clothes are unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.
You can see my ribs so well you can count them.
Look, it’s my dear Lady Disdain!
Have all your conquests, glories, triumphs, achievements, come to so little?
These child actors are now in fashion, and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all, they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys.
She’s a lot like you.
In the meantime, come home with me, and when the time is right I’ll take you to talk to him.
Very well taken, I believe, very wise.
Be loud and obnoxious.
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother.
That’s not necessary.
I’ll come with you.
First of all, Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself, which the ladies in the audience won’t be able to stand.
In its tail.
Where is the king?
Isn’t this Stephano, my drunken butler?
Her only flaw—and it’s a big one—is that she’s unbearable, a total witch, so much so that I wouldn’t think of marrying her myself, not even if I were in a worse fix than I am, not for a whole goldmine.
Where’s Antony?
Whether you bite to kill, Mastiff, greyhound, or ugly mutt,
Ah ha!
The crows flying down below look as small as ants.
You’re going to die.
As for me, I’ll leave when I like.
I told him that your father was in Venice, and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today.
Got it?
Don’t you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom?
And good ones, too.
You may be exaggerating the risks.
I can read my own fortune in my misery.
Here’s the story we’ll tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that you’re going to deliver it tomorrow.
My love, my life, my soul, beautiful Helena!
This is the inventory of the money, silverware, dishes, and jewels that are still in my possession.
But we’ll obey.
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone.
Shut the doors after you.
But I’ll marry you under different circumstances—with extravagant festivals, public festivities, and celebration.
Oh, don’t ask me why I “need” them!
What part of the agreement did I break?
Do it.
When has anyone ever put you down like that.
Taurus!
Either my eyes deceive me, or I see two husbands.
That’s not in her favor.
Where’s Seleucus?
I will pause for a reply.
What do you have to say, my dear Nurse?
Oh, how I love you!
Be tough,” says the devil, “and run!” But then my conscience, hanging around my heart, says very wisely to me, “My good friend Launcelot, you’re a good boy, the son of an honest man,” really, that should be the son of an honest woman, since my father cheated on my mother.
I can’t believe you’re my son.
Either here or at the Capitol.
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed, and early this morning the bed was empty.
If you’d been as wise as you were bold, With an old man’s mature judgment, You wouldn’t have had to read this scroll.
What have you two sisters done?
What, my good lord?  
Welcome, my good friends.
What time is it?
If her breath steams up the glass, then she’s alive.
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive?
Cheer yourself.
Yes, boy.
Madam, oh, good Empress!
No one’s life should have been entrusted to them.
Oh, pardon me for bringing this bad news, but you told me it was my job, sir.
But will it be soon?
How old is he?
The curfew-bell rang.
But please tell me more.
Fulvia is dead.
Prepare the body, then, and follow us.
Don’t come again to ask for my ransom, good messenger.
Oh Lorenzo, if you keep your promise to me, I’ll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you.
Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven.
He has called for his horse, but I don’t know where he’s headed.
We have to take the king’s side.
Let’s go.
It’s dangerous out there.
Please, follow straight after me.
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime.
Let us hear him.
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword—it can’t hurt anyone, thank God.—My lord, I thank you for your many kindnesses.
The interest rate will be— Well, Shylock?
You’d better knock louder.
They killed my children too?
But back to that argument you mentioned.
If your affection for me doesn’t convince you to come, don’t let my letter do so.” Oh, my darling, make your arrangements and go!
Don’t give up yet.
Well, we’ll see how you act.
But ships are just fragile boards, and sailors are just men.
Other than Richard, even those whom we fight against would rather we won.
You have, my lord.
But I’ll admit I don’t care for you.
If you were my fool, uncle, I’d have you beaten for getting old before your time.
What did you say, uncle?
Agincourt.
Oh, Isis, that’s impossible.
Go!
I’ll answer for everything.
Lock yourself in and send him word that you’re dead.
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig, her hair as brown as hazelnut shells, and she herself sweeter than the kernels.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I could weep my soul right out of myself!
The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too.
Which one is it?
Othello, I’ve been seriously hurt.
Yes, look, it’s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers.
Bassanio, let him have the ring.
Really, I had no intention of going for my sword.
When he comes back from hunting, I’m not going to speak to him.
I’ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago.
What friend?
Come on, what did Romeo say?
The Dauphin, whom we asked for reinforcements, sends back the answer that he’s not yet in a position to raise so great an army.
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you.
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you.
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet.
He’ll think these letters are from Olivia and that she’s in love with him.
Thank you.
He can’t possibly be such a monster— And I’m sure he isn’t.
Like hell!
Do you?
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell.
Tell me that.
Tell her to come to me.
When should the three of us meet again?
You won it.
In that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer.
But to tell you the truth, reason and love have very little to do with each other these days.
Why are your swords out?
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers.
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave.
And I was just going to yours.
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman, or why wouldn’t he be here?
Messala, I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power.
Goodbye, cousin.
Yes, but I am insulting myself by thinking this way.
Is there anything inaccurate in that?
Hurry up, it’s getting late.
I would not.
you, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago.
You’ll get some of what you want.
I know what I’ll do.
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?
Not a word.
Ha, ha, ha!
If it’s okay with you, you should not press your grievances any further, but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you.
Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch.
I’m coming.
Sir Toby, madam, your relative.
It’s good if you love Hero, because she’s worthy of your love.
Isn’t that him on the ground?
No, no, they wouldn’t.
Angelo, the jeweler.
You’re right, that’s how it is.
Would raise babies and clip coupons.
Mistress!
And Rosencrantz!
I swear to you— You have a good heart, and believe me, I’ll tell her that.
You have the sacred power to cure both of us.
Doesn’t the sun shine palely down on them, as though in contempt, killing their fruit with frowns?
Did this happen before the King of France returned home?
Why, he’s the Prince’s fool, and a very dull fool at that.
There must be some mistake, sir.
Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius.
Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave.
I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health, and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings.
Dear lady, welcome home.
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme, and I rejoice in paying the penalty, as I beg God and you to pardon me.
He’s crying out for you and swears he’ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you.
You’re too forgiving.
Dearest, kindest, most honorable sir, may I say, with your esteemed approval, which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus, that— What do you mean by that?
I don’t know, madam.
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way.
Wash your hands.
I’ll do anything you ask, monster, anything reasonable.—Come on, Trinculo, let’s sing.
No, there it is again.
Three proper young men, all good looking and with great presence—
The larger part, the main body of cavalry, are coming with Cassius.
How could it be wisdom!
I’ve had very little joy as England’s queen.  
You call that ranting?  
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness.
Good heavens, man, give them more than that!
I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it.
Where’s Peaseblossom?
I’m afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise!—And you, oh Wall, oh sweet, oh lovely Wall, you stand between her father’s property and mine, you Wall, oh Wall, oh sweet and lovely Wall.
Could you really do such a thing, for all the world?
Indeed, his mocking spirit has now crawled into a  Truly, it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick.
Where is he?
This bad weather isn’t good to walk around in.
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon.
I’ll meet you at the ferry.
No, I won’t cry any more.
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew?
A basting.
If he isn’t what he might be, then I wish to God he were!
If so, when it’s day, where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face?
I’m at your service until death.
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline, whom you loved so much?
I’ve set dangerous plans in motion, using lies, drunken prophecies, and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other.
I wish your loyalty were as foolish.
This man said, sir, that Don John, the Prince’s brother, was a villain.
I won’t stand for it.
But aren’t you drowned, Stephano?
That’s true.
Yes, that’s for sure.
Then I’ll really give it to you.
Here comes better news.
And I’ll go to bed at noon.
Madam, an eagle does not have eyes as green, as quick, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.
Two thousand ducats a year from his land! 
Didn’t I use to have four or five women taking care of me?
I know him well.
Nobody like that should be trusted.
And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it.
And that would get us all executed.
Just remember that he is Caesar.
And Juliet’s just as much in love as he, but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover.
Are you squinting at me?
Yes, this is what love does.
I cannot drink too much of Brutus’s love.
Naked in bed together, but without doing anything?
Not us.
And you, sweet Hero?
They have a massive army.
Rogue, you’ve lived too long!
We’re all against what Caesar stands for, and there’s no blood in that.
What do you think about Thursday?
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato’s daughter.
His name’s Cinna.
It was I, in fact, whom you promised to strike.
I can’t hide what I am.
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would’ve made even a nun want to sleep with me.
So, goodbye.
No, that’s the truth.
Have your wife attend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can.
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia’s: she
And like I am for Ganymede.
There’s good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found anymore.
No, I know that you’re Signior Lucentio.
I’m off, my lord.
In suicide, gods allow tyrants to be defeated.
Good night.
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
So take me to see them.
Nothing, my lord.
Help!
To Dover.
Never, my lord.
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land.
Take this. 
That’s how it will be for some other men, too, who think they’re as safe as you and I, who are well-loved by noble Richard and Buckingham.
No man must know.” What comes after that?
I hope you’re strong enough to do it.
I’m your evil spirit, Brutus.
What time is it?
But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them.
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “Caesar!” Speak.
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants, obeying my commands.
My dear Regan, your sister’s not worth anything.
Cheer up, Antonio!
I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared. 
Well, well, I don’t care.
Say something again.
Now, let it work.
Nor is it up to you, my lord.
Or rather, do what you feel like doing.
Hurry, send someone immediately!
But God forgive me for bragging.
It’s my duty, sir.
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming.
Oh love!
Hmmph!
Good.
With a doctor’s help he might recover and become an ass again.
Curse the day!
I’ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit.
If you forgive us, we’ll make everything all right.
Whatever you are, thanks for your advice.
Didn’t you clearly say “Knock,” “pound,” and “put your fists to work”?
Even if we fail at that, we can still fight him on land.
Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done.
I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here.
Please avoid doing that.
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast.
Here comes the little villain herself.
On a night like this, young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much, stealing her heart with vows of love, but not one vow was true.
He’s slept a long time.
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home.
What, don’t courtiers' hands sweat?
You know tomorrow is her wedding day.
I wish I were something better, because right now I’m a big fool.
Is the visor of my helmet working better now?
Okay, so that’s when he’ll say we stabbed him in his sleep.
Spirit, did you carry out the storm just as I ordered?
Give my love to my kind husband.
Damn it!
Get out of here, you blathering peasant!
It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone.
Men may sleep, and when they do they may have their throats with them, and some people say knives have blades.
If he stays in this country he’ll be found.
There she is.
But don’t let me keep you from going, Cassius.
And then you’ll see that despite what you thought, I’ll be as powerful as I was before.
Where are you going?
My brother’s love, the devil, and my own anger made me do it.
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right.
Now you sound like a man.
Well, you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time.
Live in the moment.
This treachery of yours is like the second 
In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible.
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads.
Will you be here when I return?
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out, “Liberty, freedom, and democracy!” People and senators, don’t be afraid.
Therefore, love each other in moderation.
This is not the way to win your daughter.
Cousin, you didn’t used to be so thickheaded.
Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”?
The business you began here needs you as well—especially the business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to.
Mine too, to join hers.
By all means.
Ask him to go in.
If he looks serious, he must need money.
Most mighty Caesar, give me some reason, so I won’t be laughed at when I tell them so.
Blab my nonsense?
Keep going, keep going, or I’ll declare myself the winner.
Halfway down the cliff there’s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs—a risky business!
What are you going to do now?
Didn’t great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice?
I’ll find your servant, and he’ll update you now and then on your case as it stands here.
How is she doing?
It was tossed into the window of my room.
I’m sure he will stay under control.
What would you like me to do?
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival.
Which is the lady I’m supposed to marry?
I don’t think it would be wise to let Mark Antony, whom Caesar is so fond of, outlive Caesar.
Pretend that you’re standing on the shore, watching a city dance on the shifting waves, and you’ll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur.
Let me gather my wits and get serious here.
I do.
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island.
What do you mean by that?
Well, there they are.
Who was with them last?
Yes, my lord.
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair.
Yes, sir.
You think you can get rid of me that easily?
Now, we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment.
Oh, let me kiss his hand!
Good Prince, say something!
Who am I then?
Well then, goodbye.
Though I wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake, for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer—just so you might value me more, so my good qualities, beauty, possessions, and friends would be more than you could calculate.
Do you know Captain Gower?
The sun is up and we’re wasting the day!
I’ll go with you.
Here he comes.
No, my lord, not me.
Oh, darling Orlando, it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling.
And I’ve built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard’s soul.
He remembers how unkind he was to her, how he disowned her and sent her abroad, how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters.
If you’re going to die, be quick about it so you can catch the king’s departing soul or follow him, like obedient subjects, to his new kingdom of endless night.
May the tongues of our critics rot!
Come on, you’re a fool, and driven to extreme measures by love.
But silence, like a knife, cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood.
She weeps for Edward and so do I, while she does not weep for Clarence, though I do.
You’ll have your answer soon.
Love’s messengers should be thoughts, which fly ten times faster than sunbeams.
A little bit.
I swear I am.
What do you say?
My dear master, my captain, my sovereign, let me say before I strike this fatal blow: farewell.
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster.
The friar’s ready.
Actually, their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are.
And if he ever has a wife, let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now.
Fate, do your work.
Why, sir, I spent it on this rope.
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin, with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her.
Until then, I have to remain calm.
I swear by this hand that I love you.
Yes, on land you do outnumber me.
It’s this servantlike mentality that’s keeping you unmarried.
It’s good you found me.
Was my father a traitor, Mother?
That really is an illegitimate hope.
Who delivered it?
As you all know, overconfidence is man’s greatest enemy.
I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son—his youngest son—and I would never change that, not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir.
I’m yours forever.
As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.
Who’s going to keep me from them?
Edward’s healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England.
When he couldn’t what?
And what is this useless ceremony of kings?
But
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies, ha?
Then let the rain come down.
They keep up Adam’s profession.
I’m learning every hour how to be subservient.
She has the stones on her, and the ducats.” I know, all the boys in Venice are following him, yelling, “His stones, his daughter, and his ducats!”
Where was she born?
No, I don’t, sir.
One more thing, sir.
You can decide that privately.
Goodbye.
Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her!
Nobody delivered it, my lord.
You do the same.
You just fell the height of ten ship masts, straight down.
Signor Antonio?
You’ve come right on time.
You need to learn what ants know well about winter—there’s no point in slaving away if there’s no hope for profit.
My ear must pull it out.
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him.
You’ve never thought of me like that, and you have no reason to.
This doesn’t look like a wedding.
Here is the door, sir.
I don’t make fortunes; I only see them.
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever.
I don’t know what to believe, father.
It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained.
We’re two lions born on the same day in the same litter, and I’m the older and more terrible.
If he fears God, he must necessarily keep the peace.
It’d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything.
Don’t say anything else.
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle.
Isn’t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife?
Even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than Macbeth.
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely.
Hey out there!
What do you have to tell me?
Just let me follow behind you, even though I’m not good enough for you.
Servant monster”?
The rest of the king’s guests are already inside.
His virtue is not hidden.
I don’t want to be cured, boy.
Why are you bothering this poor man!
No, not for all the world.
My reputation, my reputation!
Alas, I hate myself instead, because of the hateful deeds I’ve committed.
That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look, and that’s how I look.
Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it.
Kneel, Romans, kneel, and let’s wash our hands, up to the elbows, in Caesar’s blood and smear it on our swords.
He only married out of political necessity.
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Ha!
I’ll never see the likes of him again.
Yes, he’ll weep stones, as he taught us to do.
Farewell, everyone.
Mustardseed.
Fair sister, will you go with the princes or stay here with me?
But then I do you wrong to say as much, since you are the very embodiment of bravery.
Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other.
You see me standing here, Lord Bassanio.
As you wish, sir.
You scoundrel!
Meanwhile, let’s go to bed and dream about this.
How else is he the “man in the moon”?
Which of you two ate lunch with me today?
Hello!
No, lady.
Pretending?
Indeed, sir, it is.
What’s wrong with my niece?
More of us are here.
And hot as ginger.
I’ll shut up now.
I’m going now.
No epilogue, please.
Let me go with him.
Who did this, Sir Andrew?
Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem.
You mean however they dare.
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country.
Please invite them in.
And when she is peevish and perverse, sullen, sour, and disobedient to his honest wishes, what is she but a loathsome, warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord?
Who are you?
A snake could do that as easily as you could.
Certainly, I did.
You won’t leave this grove until I’ve paid you back for this insult.
My head is pounding.
Upon the king!
Awake, my lords!
It’s Cinna.
What a man!—especially compared to my husband.
Luck and Antony separate here and now.
This is our station.
They’re all dead.
He loves them both.
He’s in  They say he cried out against sherry.
But listen, if 
My heart’s too sad for long goodbyes.
She’s insistent.
I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure.
I have no doubt that you love me.
What villains did this to you?
Do you know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet one?
I don’t trust you.
I wish you’d never met him.
Goodbye to you both.
And yet for all that, if she didn’t hate him to death, she’d love him to death.
It does have a back like a weasel’s.
It has hatched a    I go unwillingly.
She had a premonition of what has actually happened.
I know him; he wears a lock of hair.
God bless my old master.
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king.
Nathaniel’s coat was being fixed, sir.
Enough, cousin.
Bad people can’t appreciate wisdom or goodness.
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here?
After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe.
Where have you sent the king?
And you’re not loyal, like us.
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions.
Neither will I.
Yeah, right, go get him.
Oh, what a mean low-life I am!
Good for you, holding out on me like this!
Why, what’s the matter?
Then both, or one, or anything you like.
We’ll talk more about this later.—Egeus, I’m overriding your wishes.
My servant!
Oh yes, sir, I have often been to Pisa—Pisa, City of Wise Men.
Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat.
Yes, and he’s been carried off the field.
We’re talking here in a public place.
You should listen to reason.
I wish you’d be patient.
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone.
What a tedious wait!
All right, go ahead, keep up your little game, pretend to be sympathetic, but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back.
I like you guys.
He’s not a “master,” sir, he’s just a poor man’s son.
How are you doing, Stephano?
Come, this way to the rowboat.
When you just want to eat, it’s better to do that at home.
I will, my lord.
Today I’m going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edward’s children or his wife’s allies.
Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye.
Your mother is coming to your bedroom.
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl?
Bring his will here, and we’ll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people.
Take this garment, put it on, and then come back here.
When the vision passes, you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool.
Goneril, you know how much I love you, but still I have to say— Shush, please.
No.
How is it that you’ve come back so soon?
What’s that?
Your honor is the reason you are leaving.
I took their stings too, wouldn’t you say?
Speak.
You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it!
Tell the constable that.
It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed.
Here’s some more news coming in.
And if your clothes were as thin as mine, you’d really feel the air.
I could do without another toast.
Are you going to take care of this thing now?
In Spain, Caesar had a fever, and it made him shake.
Edward Plantagenet, why are you dead?  
If you wish.
Damn those men shouting down there!
We’ll mutiny.
And now you know my meaning.
By Jesus, I think they will blow up everything if we don’t improve our tactics.
Remember who liked your yellow stockings—” Your yellow stockings?
I can’t get that song out of my head tonight.
Indeed, my lord, he is a perfectly wonderful horse.
Of course, they won’t believe you without proof.
Away!
Is there anyone to give the bride away?
I made my father angry, so I went to Friar Lawrence’s cell to confess and be forgiven.
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury.
Antonio, oh my dear Antonio!
I’m amazed you got here before me.
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to.
So I’ll stay here for a while.
I wish they were, so that I could die right now, because, at this point, I live a living death.
Listen to what the tyrant says.
I’ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey.
The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful.
We’ve been betrayed!
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery.
I  Isn’t this good?
Oh, what a horrible day!
I believe I have some choice in the matter, sir.
I’m not going to bed tonight.
My body waits here, but the rest of me is gone.
They wouldn’t say anything?
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now, you’d feel sorry for them.
And the doctors say it’s healthy to get up early— I don’t know what the doctors say.
I wonder what it means.
Me too.
The boy was going to support me in my old age!
What do you want?
But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl.
What kind of woman is she?
That’s how we’ll do it, then.
Aren’t you dead yet?
Search high and low, in every acre of the fields, and bring him here for me to see him.
I’ll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself.
Get up.
I’ll ask you another question.
Good night.
Get that fool out of here.
He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester.
You are too evil for words!
God knows I loved my niece, and now she’s dead—slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue.
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast.
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me.
Your case is most unusual, though the Venetian law can’t stop you from proceeding.— Yes, so he says.
My plans are almost at their climax.
He rode that prologue like a wild horse.
I love him even when he’s harsh and mean—Help me unpin this, would you?—I love even his stubbornness, his frowns, his bad moods.
I suspect some foul play.
Noble words, sir.
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.
What a horrible world we live in!
Oh!
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I’m innocent?
Bring him my head.
You go ahead, and I will follow you.
If it takes all the wine in my bottle, I’ll cure him.
He’s very handsome and speaks well, but he’s very young.
Die where you have lived, in my arms.
It was probably just a rumor.
Let’s take up the best positions we can in the valleys.
I don’t know what you and other men think of this life, but as for me, I’d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself.
I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.
So tell me what’s been going on.
I became his guide, I led him and begged for him, and kept him from suicide.
By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right?
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before.
Why, dear me, Kate!
All the spirits hate him as much as I do.
That’s very soon.
Away, away, be gone.
I could have blown up the town in an hour.
Farewell, sir.
Good afternoon, fair lady.
Give me an almanac.
The tawny cat has meowed three times.
My lord loves you.
Very true.
Be quiet, for shame!
I wish I knew what was in your heart.
I sneeze on your manhood.
What’s up, Catesby, what does your master say?
You’re right.
My words are dull.
Oh, Lord, this makes me laugh!
I’ll tell you, good Brutus.
That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation.
Instead, she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him. 
She cursed Hastings then.
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown, when, if there was any justice in this world, it should be branded with the murders you committed—your slaughter of the prince who held that crown, and of my sons and my brothers?
But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence.
Help!
What’s that noise?
Help, help, help!
Lead us, monster; we’ll follow.
What do you think you’re doing?
No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra.
No one passing by?
Your mistress is a good mount.
I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason: his father’s dying and our quick marriage.
It’s time for you to know the whole story.
Sit down, Jessica.
Here’s a postscript!.
I owe you a lot, and like a spoiled kid I’ve lost what I owe you.
That’s right, you stupid thing.
Honestly, she is too ill-tempered.
He can’t bear his grief and so he’s losing his mind.
Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her, with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears.
How are you, my friend?
Stop!
And when you get married, I hope I can be married at the same time.
Our friendship in our schooldays, our childhood innocence?
Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness?
Brutus speaks.
If you could, you couldn’t bring him back to life.
I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, with the royal seal of Denmark on it.
Did you have no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon you could use to kill me quickly, nothing so disgraceful, except banishment?
Poor imitation queen, why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he’s got you trapped in his deadly web?
What did I do?
It’s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none.
There he is!
Yes ,madam.
Oh no!
I could be sad if I wanted to be.
Don’t think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind.
I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all before long.
Didn’t I buckle this well?
So, take me, death!
This man looks like his business is urgent.
Please come with me.
Oh, my heart!
Why, what’s Tybalt’s story?
From there we’ll safely carry you to France and back, calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage.
Goodbye.
Moron!
You can do what you want, but he’s an experienced and honorable soldier.
Pray you sit still.
We thought he was a coward, but he fights like a devil.
What can you swear by now?
Signior Baptista, I’m glad to see you.—Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.
After you, sir.
As long as there are 
Did he treat you well when you saw him?
He’s bound to Octavia.
Do you really think I’m no stronger than the rest of my sex, with such a father and such a husband?
Go on ahead.
Shylock, although I never lend or borrow with interest, I’m willing to break that habit to help a friend in need.
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up.
You have no reason to say that.
We’re men beached on the sand, hoping to be washed out by the next tide.
His spirits are listening to me, but I can’t help cursing him anyway.
What could I hope to get from you, who’ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life?
The fool’s nice enough, but he’s such a huge eater, and slow as a snail when he works.
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by.
And we will raise your wages.
But for a fine, elegant, graceful, and excellent dress, yours is worth ten of those.
Treat them with honor and dignity.
Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping!
She has disarmed me.
Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial.
Don’t you have any sense at all?
It 
Come, and you can have a queen.
Well, this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women.
A good laugh.
You love me in spite of your heart, I think.
No, leave him alone.
At my house.
Are you my daughter?
It’s after six o'clock, my lord, when you said our work would be finished.
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave—and I think we do—then, countrymen, what else could we possibly need to spur us to action?
Hey, Brabantio!
Would you care to hear some music?
She was only dead, my lord, as long as her slander lived.
She’s cold.
Dolabella!
You haven’t forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you.
Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping.
Do you think so, spirit?
Would it be better if I were that, instead of what I am?
Perhaps a woman’s voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up.
Messala!
No, let’s follow him.
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I believe, virtuous— where is your mother?
Where are you all off to?
Claudio, I’m telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child.
Heart, for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined.
If I could get my hands on you, I’d make you care.
Then make a circle around Caesar’s corpse, and let me show you the man who made this will.
I guess not—for good reason, as you’ll soon hear.
When an evil thing has been lost, no one cries.
How did you lose your breath?
I’m good at everything that ordinary men can do.
Goodbye.
Why does the world report that Kate is lame?
What miracle will he work next?
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did.
Freedom!
You’re acting stupid, Casca, and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have—or else you don’t use them.
Throw some of your words at me.
What has the governor of the town decided?
I’d deny whatever evidence you had against me—even if it were in my own handwriting—and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery.
Now that I think about the danger of these knights, if you come to stay with me, please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you.
Let’s stay and watch.
Monster, I smell like horse piss, which is making my nose pretty upset.
And I was right, because where’s your husband now?
And since I wooed her in your name, I’ll join you in disgracing her.
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this, and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs?
And I wouldn’t ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one.
Defend me, God, both when I’m asleep and when I’m awake.      
As I remember, this should be the house.
We only drink toasts to my niece.
Hey, what’s this, Adam?
Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive.
If our criminal master gets off free, I won’t care what happens to me anymore.
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any.
She’ll be here soon, just like her letter said.
Make your boasts come true, and I’ll be thrilled.
There’s no doubt that Petruchio’s got quite a catch.
We’ll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi.
Where is my lord, the duke of Gloucester?
But like I said, when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast.
We’ll go visit Caliban, my slave who always talks to us so nastily.  
I hate the word peace like I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
Please be quiet.
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves.
I want to forget what I am.
We have to be married properly.
Gonzalo is a miracle-worker.
I wouldn’t change my mind even if she were 
If everyone here knows us but we don’t know anybody, it’s time, I think, for us to pack our bags and take off.
My master will be here in the morning.
Play the music.—Take my hands, my queen, and we’ll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing. 
Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome.
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion!
Goodbye.
Farewell.
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun, under the wall of the dovehouse.
Watch over Signior Leonato’s house; with the wedding being held there tomorrow, there’s a great to-do there tonight.
And, as the speaker of any prologue should, I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly.
My lord, he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day.
I’m sure I’ll never get married in the way my sisters say they’re married, loving their father only.
Oh painful day, Oh painful day!
Show him and make him grieve.
I beg your 
You have to stop talking like this.
This was the noblest Roman of them all.
Oh, help!
If I can trust my dreams, then some joyful news is coming soon.
Because, if you must know, she’s been chosen by Signior Gremio.
So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.
But I’m old now, and suffering has weakened me.
No, I’ll recite it for you right now: “de hand, de fangres, de nails—” “De nails,” madame.
I’ll have none of your money.
Listen!
Is it a weakness?
That word “judgment” makes me feel a bit guilty.
What, not a word?
Or had a friend who would be a man for me!
But didn’t you expect us to cut the cloth?
If our general had been his old self, we would have won.
This news will comfort Cassius.
Oh, sad day!
And if he advances unopposed, my lord, let us abandon France.
As dumb as dirt!
It’s going to be fun, I promise.
The king of England’s approach is as forceful as a whirlpool.
What performances have been prepared?
Peter, wait for me at the gate.
I’ll talk to you more about this some other time.
Dear sir, I pity the lady and wish—more for her sake than my own—that I was more able to help her.
What’s that, my lord?
She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft!
Surrender, dog!
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief!
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness?
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet?
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Ciceley, Gillian, Ginn!
You are completely wrong about this king.
Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us.
Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo?
Or are you low, vulgar, and of the common people?
Lie down right there.  
So, sir.
Come, trusty sword.
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation.
My lord, I’d want to have the gift you promised me on your honor: the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it.
Performing is activity, and he is always doing that.
I order you to stop!
I think they do.
You’ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me, but I’m as sane as you are.
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you?
What is it, Laertes?
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest?
And like I am for Rosalind.
I needn’t be ashamed of your Majesty, God be praised, so long as your Majesty is an honest man.
Stay right here and try to look good.
Go ahead—rage till your proud heart breaks.
A faithful shepherd worships you.
Shut up, fool.
He says your daughter’s not feeling well, my lord.
Tell me, how is my mother?
He’s not telling the truth.
I saw it with my own eyes.
You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance.
You will also confess, I’m sure, that you love me.
But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened.
Your face betrays strange feelings, my lord, and people will be able to read it like a book.
Don’t forget the vows we made to each other.
When he wakes up!
What would you like, sir?
Oh, I’m sick, sick!
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them.
As for myself, it was Greek to me.
That’s well spoken.
Yes, now I’m in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool.
Merciful powers, keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest!
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven, while I cried salty tears into the salty sea, and groaned at our situation.
I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome.
A man, like you.
Ah, but I know you.
I’m that great gust to her fire.
Yes, that’s all true—but what do you mean by it, my lord?
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind?
Nobody was hurt in the slightest.
Tell me so I can be satisfied.
My lord, could I have a word with you?
Your name is Lucentio, you say.
Here it is.
No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs.
Then you were right on target.
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better?
All right, I understand.
Halt!
That part of his reputation will stand.
Rage on, blow!
I remember a fight, but not why we were fighting.
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with, I’d crack heaven wide open with my laments!
Oh, Pyramus, get up!
If you were king, we would do the same.
Then keep your vow, fellow, when you meet the man.
I respect the soul very much, so I disagree with his belief.
There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me.
This is Cinna.
We charge you, in the Prince’s name, to stop!
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands, the wise head defends itself at home.
Gentlemen, stand up.
Let’s go offer up our lives 
May He bless you, too.
You’re just playing around.
Would I send a lie?
Things have turned out so unluckily, sir, that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you.
The two of them were separated during the storm.
I’m leaving now.
My dear fool, because my brother died.
Katherine the shrew!” That’s the worst thing you can call a young woman.
Goodbye, good Mr. Love.
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them.
They want to whip me for telling the truth, you want to whip me for lying, and sometimes I’m even whipped for keeping quiet.
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold: he was neither sad nor happy.
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.
But I have a sinking feeling anyway.
I think I saw you there, you wise man.
But how?
And don’t lie.
Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation!
I don’t know how.
Please, remain seated.
Where’s your sparkle now?
Do you want to hear what she says?
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed ass’s head off of the head of that Athenian man, so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do, they can all go back to Athens.
I was engaged to both of them.
That governs the torso and heart, doesn’t it?
Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.
Give me the vial.
Just go after him and watch what he does next.
Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think.
Are you there?
There’s no scarier wild bird than the living lion, and we should remember that.
I’ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring!
If people take what he says, fine.
Just say “Yes” and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye.
My Lord Constable, are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight?
Come on.
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up?
Oh, it’s a disaster, a disaster, by this hand, it’s a disaster.
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are!
Katherina, you may stay.
It’s almost ten o'clock.
Some are born great—”
Hello, sir.
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind.
There’s little or nothing of that.
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
Who’s there, aside from this foul weather?
Do you love me?
Then Caesar and he will always be united.
He’s made me a little sore, I’ll admit.
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land.
Never!
Let’s send this news to Rome.
That only proves how inexperienced you are.
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married.
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man.
You’re lying, you shaggy-haired villain!
A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would— Would do what?
If you could please stop fooling around, I’ll tell you what your mother wants.
And yet I’ll still have plenty.
No, keep going, old man; don’t stop like that.
Wait until I read the letter.
Young Fortinbras, returning in triumph from Poland, is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors.
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds, take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries.
I know you.
Get me some ink and paper, and hire some horses to ride.
Nothing that I know for sure, but a lot that I’m afraid might happen.
What man is that?
It’s a common  What?
I know you’re my oldest brother, and deserve more respect.
Come on, let’s go see the king.
Is there anything else you wish?
If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it.
Don’t just swear by it; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me.
I tell you, man, it’s better for me, too, than the last time we met here.
Or if you haven’t sat as I do now, boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues, then you haven’t loved.
Of course I will.
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for.—Get out of my sight, scoundrel!
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight.
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves.
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died, and that it would be buried with you.
This disease is beyond my medical skills.
The Prince has made the match, and may God bless it.
On record, my gracious lord.
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.
I feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm.
What do you get to drink, instead of sweet obedience, but poisonous flattery?
I’ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman.
I’m a nobleman, and I know what I’m doing in assigning this job to you.
Give me your hand.
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight?
I have news, ma'am.
You’re smart, though, and if you were sick, you’d take what you needed to get better.
Well put, Maecenas.
Don’t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord’s anointed king.
Well, until that time, don’t come near me.
You should have reprimanded him for that.
Indeed, honor is what I want to talk to you about.
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality.
Listen to me, madam.
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it.
I might do something I’ll be sorry for.
Oh, no.
Is your master awake?
Listen to you, instructing me like a parrot would.
This will make them both so afraid that they’ll kill each other just by looking at each other.
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth.
In that case, there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months.
You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour?
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen!
It’s not quite that simple.
No thanks, my good mother.
No, and I didn’t hear anything either, or suspect anything at all.
Do tell.
Did you talk with him?
Isn’t there a guard around?
We shouldn’t have too big a celebration—we can invite a friend or two.
Do you have desires?
On, on, on, on, on!
Be careful, Signior Baptista, lest you be made the dupe in this business.
And now it looks like you need my help.
Is she enclosed in silver, which is ten times less valuable than gold?
I have a bad cold that’s bothering me.
Short but still tedious?
But my daughter should know about this, so she can be prepared with an answer just in case.
If true lovers are always thwarted, then it must be a rule of fate.
Come, gentlemen, let’s discuss tomorrow’s action in my tent.
And he’s rubbed himself with perfume.
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
Where’s this so-called king?
For shame!
You, who are neither honest nor good.
Yes, or to wear cosmetics?
Stand close together, in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to— Don’t talk about standing together.—Publius, cheer up.
As long as heaven and nature extend it.
Oh, that’s not true, my lord.
Why do you care that he loves Hermia?
Good.
In the meantime, think about how I can do you good and give you what you want.
Well go on home.
Hurry, hurry, close the curtain quick.
No, it was just a dream.
Just obey me a little bit longer.
Don’t worry about me.
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours.
What’s he talking about?
Signior Benedick!
Heaven help him!
Saw who?
Shake off your sleepiness.
Why bother with them?
Saint Davy’s Day has passed.
I’d feel sorry for them, if I were human.
Please, Horatio, go with him.  
I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man.
Welcome, good Robin.
You won’t kill me, will you?
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio.
Get out of here, before his bad luck infects you too.
Yes, indeed, and all the King’s men, the Duke of Milan and his fine son too.
Let’s go.
Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels?
If you hadn’t shown up on cue, my lord, Lord Hastings was going to take your part—I mean, he was going to speak for you—in the crowning of the king.
Should I tell you why?
On what grounds?
He’s asking him to tell the story again.
Why, so did you.
He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me.
My leg’s been cut in two.
You can’t find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you.
That’s the truth.
Fury, Fury!—Get over there, Tyrant, there.
Tell her we mean her no disrespect.
I hope he’s in love.
Your love’s name is Rosalind?
What are you saying, Cordelia?
He and his daughter are captured.
I hope you’re not trying to cheat me.
No.
I can’t make up for everything that I’d like to, so accept such kindness as I can offer.
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it.
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring?
My man—monster is so drunk he can’t talk.
Hero is his only child, and his only heir.
With anger, with fever, or with hunger, sure, my friend, but never sick with love.
You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio.
I’ve seen the whole thing, and it’s completely worthless—unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines—which they memorized so painfully—are funny.
Who’s that?
I’m arresting you as a criminal.
Thank the lord for alliances!
You’re sure the handwriting is your brother’s?
Where am I going?
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one, as he thinks, who is the bravest, most valorous, and thrice-worthy gentleman of England.
We would have liked to have heard your good advice, which has always been serious and helpful, at the council today, but we’ll wait until tomorrow.
Bardolph, be happy.—Nym, rouse your bragging spirits.—Boy, be brave.
Yes, we talked for a couple of hours.
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine.
Are you satisfied, Jew?
Give me your first, Mr. Mustardseed.
Master, is this Satan’s mistress?
But by the grace of God, she’s mine.
Watch him closely.
Did he stare at you?
Tell me to run, and I’ll run.
What else can I say?
Give him this letter.
But, hang on!
I have it on me here.
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia.
Please don’t be angry.
But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back.
Just look at me kindly, and I’m invincible against their hatred.
If you say that, you bastard, you’ll kill your Queen.
I prefer to call it a “hanger.” But anyway.
So let me sleep next to you.
You lie.
My baby hawk?
Take it off and throw it on the ground.
Why do you say that?
Yes, what about it?
But goodbye.
From the highest to the lowest of you, I bid you a hearty welcome.
Did you see anything?
Cambio.
Goodbye then, Hero.
Yes, mother, but I wish I hadn’t.
Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good?
Because Pyramus is a good-looking man, the most handsome man that you could find on a summer’s day, a lovely gentlemanly man.
We haven’t even talked about who’ll be our torchbearers.
Besides, there’s no king, however pure his cause, who, if it comes to a trial by combat, can rely on using completely blameless soldiers.
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so.
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord, your king, your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land.
Come like shadows and depart in the same way!
The graceful and renowned king is dead.
Why, are we turning to men?
In every good thing they do.
Did you call me?
Can’t I say something?
Why, sir, must he?
In what sense, my lord?
Yes, he said something in Greek.
I don’t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him, I still want to speak to him.
Lord, Lord, she’ll be a happy woman.
Cheer up!
Go get me something I can use to break down the door.
You wouldn’t know enough to be afraid of traps.
Become a better
Do they attract big audiences?
And now you cry, even though she has risen up above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
Are you going riding this afternoon?
Give me another horse!
Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello.
Sir, I think I saw him last night.
But I guess it doesn’t matter.
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message.
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy?
Who’s in there?
Didn’t I deserve anything more than a fool’s head?
If they do this, as they will, God willing, my ransom will soon be raised.
From what, in God’s name?
Anyway, go tell your master I am here.
Then meet me right away at the notary’s.
If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats.
And when he strikes back at you, he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there.
We’ll have the barber trim it later, along with your beard.
The last time I was in Exeter, the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it “ My lord!
From my kind uncle, who I know will give it to me, especially as it’s not worth much.
I shouldn’t make you do more than you’re able.
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time?
Signior Angelo, please excuse us.
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia.
If I could colonize this island, my lord— He’d cultivate weeds on it.
I’m too young to remember anything like it.
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men.
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians; but now, let him think about his own debt.
The smell of leek turns my stomach.
Go get money.
Listen, I hear them.
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman, taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures.
Not yet, cousin.
Yes, and I’ll do everything I just said.
I can’t help remembering the things that were most precious to me.
Some water will fix that.
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard, who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him.
Tom’s chilly.
Yes.
We’ve got to give them and take them, my lord.
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour.
I’m crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I’m dying to have.
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly.
I say a devil.
Our handwriting gives away our hearts.
Leave me quickly.
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother, and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you.
I’ll go to him.
I’m going to tell Desdemona my feelings.
The devil must be behind this.
You, constable, are representing the Prince himself.
Come along with us, Signor Fabian.
Live, live!
Looking just like the dead king.
Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair.
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile.
Oh, dear God, please help him!
Is this true?
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with.
Don’t attack by land.
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you.
Come away with me.
It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough.                      
A witty if a cynical reply.
Caesar, beware of Brutus.
That’s unbelievably bad.
Yes, as much as you look like yourself.
Who are you, coming so fast in this quiet night?
Oh, heavenly mixture!
This was the basket.
Help!
So you’ve dared him to single combat.
Yes, I really think so.
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her.
It wants you to go off with it, as if it wants to tell you something alone.
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen; at eighty, it’s a bit late.
I never offended him at all.
May the gods bless Antony today!
You wrong me even more, sir, by denying it.
He is an animal worthy of Perseus.
You!
What’s up, mister?
Don’t ask me to talk about it.
Don’t compare a woman’s love for a man with my love for Olivia.
Forgive me, darling Rosalind.
Calm down, calm down.
Here comes a messenger.
Madam, good night.
Wait good Nurse.
So let me hear what you have to say.
So how did it go, sir?
My heart adores him, even though my tongue curses him.
Romeo is coming.
What’s your name?
On the way, we came across my wife, her sister, and their gang of vile associates.
What?
Can’t help it?
And does she have to die for this?
What an idiotic place this world is.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
I’ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man.
I swear, I don’t like the look of you.
But brother, I have some strange news for you.
I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore.
I’ll hide and listen in.
I’ll tell you more later about when and where we met, how we fell in love, and how we exchanged promises, but now I’m begging you: please, agree to marry us today.
Is your little pearl in there?
It’s the devil speaking through him.
Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island.
It doesn’t excuse your cruel behavior.
The moon’s bright tonight.
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand.
No, just to the gates of hell, where the devil will meet me, with the horns on his head like a cuckold, and say, “Go up to heaven, Beatrice.
Now die, die, die, die, die.
This letter’s going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot.
Where’s Antony?
Should I say to you, “Set them free!
So, good-bye.
Come on, shovel.
Here, sir!
He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy 
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool.
I’ll follow you and turn this hell I’m in into a kind of heaven.
There’s Dolabella, who was sent from Caesar.
He thinks highly of me.
It’s nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted.
The only thing that I’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house, the Phoenix, for lunch.
Why are we talking about him like this?
Yours, if we’re talking about  I’m leaving.
Why do you say that?
And why did you come?
He’s very serious, which is right for someone in mourning like me.
I’m sorry to hear this.
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief— Then what?
Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man?
You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return.
Let’s go to the king.
Look, here she comes, with your ungovernable wives in tow, like prisoners of her womanly persuasion.—Katherine, that cap of yours doesn’t look good on you.
Is that how it’s going to be?
Take it easy!
Dear friends, let’s go to bed.
You tell her, widow!
Come, father, I’ll leave you at a friend’s house.
Yes, be content, good Touchstone.
The table is full on both sides.
Who put my servant in the stocks?
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well.
Go, and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind. 
Doesn’t that sound like true love?
Let me talk, good lady.
I’m going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol.
No, that’s not it—it’s because of what happens in the marriage bed.
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion.
I can help you find a wife who’s rich, young, beautiful, and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman.
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love, when merely thinking about love makes me so happy.
I didn’t think I would ever fight Pompey.
You’ll see.
Now, good-bye.
Was that him just now?
In the end I grudgingly consented.
Why, sir, I told you an hour ago that the good ship  This fellow’s gone mad, and so have I. We’re in some kind of dream world.
Yes, I’ll grant you that.
Then heaven have mercy on me!
Let me borrow a mirror.
I always loved you.
How do you mean?
No stony tower, no brass walls, no airless dungeon, no iron chains can contain a strong mind.
So farewell, all, for my tongue has almost finished with its life.
Mark Antony, take Caesar’s body.
I swear on my soul it was a lie.
First, he sends his regards.
Go now, Lord Constable and all you princes, and quickly bring us news of England’s defeat.
Your grief should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would never end.
Men act imprudently sometimes, then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them.
Please forgive and forget.
If he hears you, you’ll make him angry.
You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you.
Goodbye.
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well, and now he’s become a real man.
I curse myself for doing that!
A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius.
I’ll think it over.
Good sir, this ring was given to me by my wife.
Oh, it’s too bad!
Good idea.
And how did she react to all this?
I stretch my joke for that word “fat.” If you add that word to the word “goose,” it shows that you are a fat goose.
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face?
These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear.
My dear madam, why are you in mourning?
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness, serving you loyally and wholeheartedly.
Is the news good or bad?
Here they come.
Listen to me.
Your eyes look threatening.
Let’s go, Nerissa.—
Large and increasing.
Wherever he goes, he inspires compassion and people turn against us.
I don’t have the cash right now.
Your mother sends her blessings.
I’m ashamed that I yielded to them.
I’m off to Venice.
Forgive me.
When I like the way you look, for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask!
Who’s there!
But whenever you feel a larger pain, the smaller one disappears.
I’m a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
I hope to make the sender blush for it.
So what do you say to my suit?
My niece already thinks he’s insane.
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living.
It’s a good thing for you that, being castrated, you can better concentrate on my needs.
Here’s mine.
I’d rather they killed me than have to live without your love.
Hello, sir!
It is the best horse in Europe.
What is it?
What foolish thief brags about his crimes?
This chatter is no cure for my toothache.
Never, my lord.
Ha!
This bigmouth jerk here—( He’ll still die by hanging, not drowning, even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him.
Here comes your father.
Yes, I am.
I’ll return the favor.
She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead.
Don’t worry, Baptista, you’ll be perfectly satisfied.
Therefore you must run, noble Cassius.
You’ll  Enough of this.
As long as you move gracefully, look handsome, and say nothing, I’m yours for the dance.
I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined.
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast—for only twelve people!
Where that “sweetheart” said I was her husband!
Yes, that’s the one.
Laugh at the power of other men, because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth.  
For a while, no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles.
I got it from him.
Yawn, snore.
I didn’t think you would follow me.
But I don’t have any good sides.
We thank your Honor.
Why is that cauldron sinking?
Your husband lies dead there, and Paris too.
I don’t know what else it could be.
Oh, really?
That’s most appropriate.
I wish I could believe you that all was well!
If the English had any sense, they would run away.
Murder!
All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your best attribute.
You’re thought to be the most 
Fever, as we know, is a kind of madness.
And he’s friendly with Caesar.
If they let you off, then we’ll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power.
Goodbye, sir.
Put on your nightgown.
That’s worse.
Where is your husband?
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince, your great-uncle, who fought a tragic battle on French soil, routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop, smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen.
That’s not good.
Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for.
I assure you, sir, it’s true.
Run, run, my lord.
By God, your doors were locked and you were shut out.
I wouldn’t care about my spirits, if my legs weren’t tired.
Good, good, I like that—it’s only fair!
I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.
That’s good.
I wish I was your bird.
But please forgive me, darling, for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently.
Why, what’s the problem?
That’s as good as proof that the sweet young man’s in love.
Do you have anything else to say?
Another studpid answer!
Another case: Hugh Capet, who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine—sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great—passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare, daughter of Charlemagne, who was the son of Lewis the Emperor (who was the son of Charles the Great), in order to give his claim to the throne more validity (though, in fact, the claim was completely false and worthless).
Did you kill him, then?
Has she already forgotten her brave husband, Prince Edward, whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger?
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace.
My lord, your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp.
I tried to play games with God, and he turned my fake prayer on my head, giving me for real what I’d asked for as a joke.
And I won’t be there either.—Edmund, I’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father.
Arm yourself.
Richard Earl of Cambridge, I arrest you for high treason.
So don’t advise me.
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the  You’re being arrested?
Your life has had honor in it.
I wish night would come, like a widow dressed in black, so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity.
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me.
I’m a soldier, more experienced than you, and better able to give orders.
Wow, we’re really going to drive him crazy.
The ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to.
Put on my crown.
Look how cheerful my mother is, only two hours after my father died.
Actually, I’m still feeling some pangs of conscience.
You’re in trouble either way.
May the god of power make me, the weakest of the weak, your mediator.
Lighten up.
No, I’m sure it has, Volumnius.
With all my heart, I give you that thing which, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try with all my heart to keep from you.
And there comes Caesar.    
Know that I am Brutus!
What do you say?
Benedick’s heart is like a bell, with his tongue as the clapper: everything his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
A night isn’t much time for addressing matters of this importance.
Thank you for that joke.
I will, sir.
Ah, he got you back, Benedick!
Your highness, could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth?
Don’t worry about the consequences.
Woman, stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you.
Dear Sir Toby, don’t do anything rash tonight.
Dear Duke, please listen to what I have to say.
We’re at your service, my lord.
That was a humorous message.
Hail!
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time, or he’ll suffer for this.
Will you abandon such gentle lambs, God, and throw them to the wolves?
My lord?
No more than twenty-five.
Is he standing or sitting?
You, sir?
So I won’t choose what many men desire, because I won’t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population.
The three of you have killed a sweet, innocent woman.
No, it’s dreadfully steep.
I’m glad you’ve come, father.
Come on, sister.
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels.
I demand to be satisfied.
He tried to kill me recently, very recently.
We shall, my liege.
I won’t sleep until I see her, Hortensio.
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that much.
Well, let it strike ten then.
But it doesn’t matter.
Thank God, thank God!
What, would you let a snake bite you twice?  
Scorn and defiance, indifference, contempt, and any insult that wouldn’t disgrace the mighty sender—that’s the value he puts on you.
Listen, please, give me the necklace.
But I have to remember that I’m here on Earth, where doing evil is often praised, and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake.
Let’s act quickly.
He must be very near by now.
God will revenge it.
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be.  
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has.” Must give everything—for what?
Nothing.
I won’t have one any bigger.
I’d hate to waste my speech on the wrong person, because It’s very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it.
He’s as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance.— I will indeed.
I will confess it to all the world.
Three times in an hour I saw him down, and three times up again and fighting.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye.
What’s this?
If there’s anything more sorrowful left to add, keep it to yourself.
Romeo, are you crazy?
It’s mine and I’m going to get it.
Which one of you is the lady of the house?
Please stop, sir.
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks.
In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible.
Your Majesty shall mock at me.
We’ll have to think about it carefully.
But only hint at this vaguely, because, as you know, my mother’s still alive.
The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits.
Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions.
Yes, but now there’s no way to calm him down.
Sure, but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it.
The words expressly specify “a pound of flesh.” So take your penalty of a pound of flesh, but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it, the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law.
I never gave him reason to be jealous.
But you promise you can keep a secret?
Here’s my hand.
We failed in half of our mission.
Put your straw hats on, have some fun, and dance with these young nymphs.
I will my lord, as fast as I can.
Lord Hamlet.— Please let him be all right!
Unfaithful?
Yes, my lord, I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news.
You have the power to fix it.
I really don’t know.
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks.
But shhh!
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back—though you may accuse me of boasting—I could easily get myself a wife.
If you’re smart, you’ll go home.
Thanks for your company but, really, I would have preferred being alone.
I’m not as happy as I seem.
Well then, I’ll say this quickly: the valiant Paris wants you as his bride.
No, sir.
Are any ships leaving tonight?
I can’t run away.
Oh!
Come on.
What—is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank?
Death and damnation!
If knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe from that fate.
What you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually.
I know she trusts you and tells you everything.
By my sword, Beatrice, you love me.
What do you think of this plan?
Yes, we’re the privates in her army.
You knew—no one knew, no one knew as well as you did—about my daughter’s plans to run away.
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he’s given away.
Come.
Don’t imagine that I’ll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains.
He followed the old man.
If someone like me is fit to be king, let me know.
I know him to be valiant.
Where should I go?
Baptista is a noble gentleman—one to whom my father is not completely unknown—and lovely as his daughter is, she is entitled to any number of suitors—myself among them.
The Moor is being tricked by some crook, some terrible villain, some rotten bastard.
Send for the Count.
Oh, but I think of him more highly than I say I do—and I wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes.
My mistress,” I said.
I wish the night were here already!
Show me the way.
Is that what you’ve heard?
The town is besieged, and the trumpet calls us to the gap, and we talk and do nothing, by Christ.
They’ll set their watches to whatever time we say.
Thus, it should be clear as day that King Pepin’s title, Hugh Capet’s claim, and the resolution of King Lewis’s doubts all plainly derive from the female.
Who calls so coldly?
Coward!
Heaven knows.
What do you think, Bottom?
Well, then, what are you messing up?
You were sent for.
It’s time to hide, wretched Margaret.
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news.
Where is she?
Follow him, friends.
How are things now?
A lover would have to be weepier, of course.
So much for our plan.
Hail to you, thane of Glamis!
Who’s that?
Read it.
What is your name?
Did you hear the news that’s going around?
Around nine o'clock, madam.
Yes, let the count take you in your bed.
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about.—Come on, bring in the stocks, now!
It’s a big deal to you.
So be calm.
Well, I’ll commit the sin of double-dealing, and deal you a second coin.
Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today.
We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us.
Didn’t you say something?
My happiness and yours lie in her.
Now everyone be seated, as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat.
Sure, or anything else you show him.
Amen to that!
What are you doing, Caesar?
How exactly have I offended you?
Come on. 
We, now at our largest, can only decrease.
Let go of it!
If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.
You seem all right now.
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you.
I’ll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart.
Why are you treating my sister like this?
Who’s this?
God and your work be praised, victorious friends.
In the entire play, not one word is well-written, and not one of the actors is right for his part.
Her father is Baptista Minola, a pleasant and courteous gentleman.
I’ll go hunting again tomorrow, I think.
That’s me.
Kingly power seems most like God’s power when the king mixes mercy with justice.
We’ve been waiting a long time for this day.
All right, then.
Indeed, we have many good days to look forward to!
I’ll rest here.
The street is narrow here.
Why?
But tell me honestly, are you sure you’re not insane?
Though our lives—   We have decided, my lord.
Therefore, depart, and leave him here with me.
Yes, ma'am.
This madman will murder me.
What do you want to say, sir?
So you’re telling me to give it time and wait for summer.
Hurry up.
You see how naïve and foolish I’ve been.
He looks humbler than he used to.
Come on, you’re being ridiculous!
They’re calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.
I’ll arrest him.
Will my daughter be a good musician, do you think?
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage.
No.
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar’s wounded cloak, how will you feel, kind men, now?
What are you reading, teacher?
Do you have what I told you to get?
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it, and by Rosalind.
Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash.
He’s great-looking, but how can you talk to someone who doesn’t speak your language?
Oh, God help me!
I couldn’t pay my debt to the Jew on the due date.
Oh, shut up.
Will we hear from you before bedtime, Catesby?
I’m afraid to think how I’ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you.
Don’t you think you should go to bed, Malvolio?
Listen to that Petruchio: she says she’ll see you hanged first.
If so, you’d be buying them to sell again.
You’re defending an impostor?
Why not stay and hear me talk to him?
What can we do to find out if it’s true?
You know, he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here.
Why don’t you have a seat, your highness?
I’m your love, no matter what you think.
I have it ready.
Quiet, there!
What do you say, your Highness, about my just request?
I think you’re right, sir.
I’ve sworn I’ll never sleep with him or talk to him again.
Well, I won’t take it any longer.
Sinful Macduff, they were killed because of you!
What would you like?
Did you fall?
They steal hearts.
Well, hello there, Horatio!
Indeed, Hero herself can!
Good to see you, Corporal Nym.
What gentleman?
Passionate”?
But he’s not better than mine.
But do you think that’s what he’s aiming for?
They are harder than the stones the house is made of.
It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion.
Signior Gremio, are you coming from the church?
Have a safe trip.
Come, everyone.
Would your highness like to take a walk?
Listen to me, good Shylock.
This is the final discussion I will grant.
With the help of the grim  The first to greet me there was my great 
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more.
Here’s money for you.
I thank you for that quip, good Tranio.
Damn it, who’s there?
But you heard him swear up and down that he was.
Just the weathervane moving.
This is all that’s left for me to do, but I won’t do it.
Swaggering?
Were you born here?
I wouldn’t have dared!
You knew my father well; therefore, you know me, the sole heir to all his property and possessions, which I have added to rather than depleted.
No, I must let them find me.
What if this mixture doesn’t work at all?
Come, come, you are too clever for your own good.
Your head, my lord?
What do you mean by that, Malvolio?
If love has touched you, love has touched you—end of story.
You have wonderful armor, but give my horse his due.
I mean please go into the house, sir.
I’ve had to acknowledge that he’s my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment.
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help.
Is he all right?
Horrid villain!
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather, very troubled.
Not true.
I wasn’t born to die on your sword.
To get used to the life you’ll most likely be leading soon, get rid of your low-class trappings.
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave?
Please, leave me alone.
Silence, then!
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew, speak up, please.
If he is too insistent, tell him that romance is like a dance: it has its own rhythm and timing.
There’s nothing to get upset about.
This will either make us or break us.
Before you make  My lord, you could really help me out now.
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?
No, I won’t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt.
Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt dead too?
I ask for him, and he comes.
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.
Often, when I’m dulled by worry and melancholy, he lightens my mood with his merry pranks.
That’s what the bill says.
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed.
Gregory, remember how to slash.
Look—his noble blood is still on it.
He’s given his empire to a whore, and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war.
The sky frowns and scowls on our army.
Yes, better than you know me.
But a dream itself is just a shadow.
Tie up the servant, for he is mad as well.
Fa, sol, la, mi.
Because, my good king, England is so poorly led, her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain, silly, shallow, impulsive youth, that she’s hardly a threat.
I think he will stand strong with us.
What’s the prize?
When it’s paid, bring your friend back.
Stop hollering, man!
Not much.
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood.
Come on.
Are you mad?
Arrest him: he’s a friend of the duke of Alençon’s.
Don’t disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven’s will.
Driven?” Really?
Quick, quick.
Farewell, farewell!
Let it end, or let me die so I won’t have to watch any more of it.
It was just removed from from the heart of—oh, she’s dead!
followed you on your sad wanderings, ever since your bad luck began.
What woman’s servant?
Yes, it’s me.
That tree could be called God’s tree, since it drops such wonderful fruit.
What’s the matter with you now?
I have my naked sword out.
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you.
Let’s go up to the castle.
I think you are.
I’d be very grateful to you if you did.
piece of cheese will get him.—I challenge you to a match.
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty.
Oh, there’s my lady!
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman.
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky, I put myself right where I thought it would hit.
He stayed like that a long time.
Teach me to forget to think!
What kind of work is this, Charmian?
Well, I’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan, and I have every hope of succeeding.
Neither can my accomplishments at sea.
No, he’s in a place worse than hell.
I can’t love him.
I hit hard when I’m angry.
Good night, my lord.
No, my dear cousin.
I’ll tell them that we won’t hurt anyone with our swords, and that Pyramus isn’t really dead.
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine, but when he touches them, they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven.
I thought that thing you’re talking about was a man.
Oh, what a long, tedious, exhausting night!
Why did this have to happen now?
Good, sir?
Romeo killed Tybalt.
Good-bye.
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak, sorrow-ravaged voice?
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him.
Swear your love for each other.
Change into better clothes.
Yes, it’s true.
Come on, you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you’re in the mood.
CASSIO  She’s awake, sir.
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards.
Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell, Signor Baptista?
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back.    
I’ve only made it this far since I left her place, walking at a moderate pace.
Don’t pardon that.
This is his sword.
Be patient, because the prize I’m leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now.
Give me my sword.
Oh, that’s a good wish!
When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you?
Caesar!
Don’t stay here, go away.
So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me?
I can’t offer her more than all I have.
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of.
The Duke of Cornwall, my master and patron, is arriving tonight.
You’re perfect, without a rival in the world, made up of the best qualities of every creature.
This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid.
And, when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom you know I hate, rather than Paris.
I can’t tell you anything else.
You can take your chances after dinner.
I’ve been here too long.
And when some lowlife protests that  Stop, and eat no more.
Oh, these fools!
I will, my lord.
I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely.
I’m as crazy as he is, if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent.
He’s running bareheaded, calling for the end of the world, out there on a night like this, when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide.
Curse you for your false appearances!
Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds?
What’s the message from the English king?
If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it.
The advancement of your children, noble lady.
You’re both wrong.
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I’m being murdered.
Do you have the flower?
Since I’m suddenly all the rage, it will be worth the cost.
Goodbye, Helena.
So the pale, angry moon, who controls the tides, fills the air with diseases.
You insolent rascal, what trade?
Your mother’s been poisoned.
You are nothing like Mark Antony!
Tranio, I think I’ve got it!
Look with your ears.
My sword and I will earn our place in history.
They’re wise and honorable, and will no doubt give you reasons for it.
The English have promised me thousands of troops.
Will you say grace, sweet Kate, or shall I?—What is this?
I’m afraid it will make you too hot, too.
Come with us, Lepidus.
Everyone keeps yelling, “Here they come!” Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige.
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday, at six in the morning, four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday, in the afternoon.
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread!
That’s for sure.
If a ship’s leaving, come to the marketplace.
Why do people love you?
Oh yes, three thousand ducats.
He’s conducting some business with my lady, and sooner or later he’ll leave.
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged?
If it pleases your Majesty, it is the token of a man I must fight with, if he’s still alive.
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog.
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music.
But action speaks louder than words, so I’ll cut short these polite words.
I’ll get him to come here, and you can ask him yourself.
Oh, please don’t swear, my lord of Buckingham.
Now Antony has to leave her completely.
No, not a chance.
This guy’s wise enough to play the fool, and only clever people can do that.
If they march along unopposed, I will sell my dukedom for a sodden, filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion.
Just being thanked is more than enough for me, madam.
Prince Dauphin, you’ll stay with me in Rouen.
Don’t you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph’s nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell?
There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness.
Has my master returned yet?
I will, lady.
It doesn’t make either of us happy, I know.
You  But, uncle, we’re being disrespected.
Oh, your report is too poetic, but it sounds so true!
There was no story, my lord.
Yes, it’s true, sir.
Did they make you the messenger?
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar.
A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, he’ll come or go as he pleases.
It’s nine o'clock!
Am I a coward?
I know she is a hateful, brawling scold.
Please, pay him immediately.
Wasn’t that the best thing to do?
What does Romeo say?
What did you say?
Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice, and shout “So, so!” Each one of your servants will rush here,
Both of you are very welcome here.
You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient!
And how he loves Caesar!
Oh that great, funny guy, Bottom!
Oh, gods, give me patience!
No, that’s not it, trust me.
I believe it won’t stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm.
Then lay that sentence on me too, my lord.
Are those my tents on fire?
So everyone goes off into the world except me, who stays in because I’m sunburned.
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order, who came after Clarence was already buried.
I have to go to England, don’t you know that?
What did your song mean, lady?
Fill my cup, Lucius, until the wine overflows it.
I’ve got no food to give you.
We don’t intend any harm to you, nor to anyone else.
Your wife wouldn’t like it if she were here to hear you make that offer.
You think so?
You seem to be a good person, captain, and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside, I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners.
Big, round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose.
I love rich Capulet’s daughter.
They’re on the march.
If it were me, I’d be very upset too.
But what do you say to my request?
All these friends are my witnesses, so I swear to you, I swear by your beautiful eyes, in which I see myself reflected— Did you hear that!
Give me your arm.
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her.
But I see you’re troubled.
My sister is all those things, or else she should be.
Now two things still need to be done.
Where are you coming from?
And I saw her do it.
Yes, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
They say there are only five people on it.
Robin Starveling, the tailor?
Just you wait.
Go on, Caesar.
That’s always true.
And would I have ever done that to you?
Take him away.
If we take away Caesar’s support, he’ll have to come back down to earth; otherwise, he’ll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience.
May God thank you for it.
Why?
I’m ordering you, go home.
Frightening looks are also at my service, as are fake smiles.
When I talked about all these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively.
But even so, we can’t do without him.
I’m sure there was a herd of lions nearby.
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest.
Which one of them should I pick?
It’s like a cannon.
Go to him from me.
Farewell to both of you, dear teachers.
If he will grant me conquered Egypt, so that I may give it to my son, I will kneel to him with thanks.
My lord, this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry’s reign.
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign.
If he backs down, he’ll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God’s earth, in my opinion.
You’ve never seen anything like it.
If there’s any way I can spoil his life, I’ll be overjoyed.
He says I won’t get into heaven because I’m a Jew’s daughter, and he says you’re irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you’re raising the price of pork.
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead.
Where’s that dog?
Dear Mr. Fabian, do me another favor first.
Investigate how this foul murder came about.
But where is he?
That’s true, it’s your beauty’s fault.
Whatever I think, I have to say.
And when I’m king, remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it, which my brother the king used to own.
Please, please tell me!
I’d like to know.
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation.
Read it, great Caesar.
I don’t want to go mad.
And earth!
Never, my lord.
I didn’t accuse you of lying.
My sword will talk for me.
All I’ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already.
Twenty thousand crowns now, and half my lands after my death.
I charge you, in the name of God, be careful what you say.
Let’s play billiards.
But since the gibe glanced off me, ten to one it hit you both straight on.
Peter!
Sir, these accusations should be answered.
You’re a fool.
Good-bye!
Please go.
No eyes in your head til there’s money in your wallet?
God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it.
Hey, lady!
Your daughter and son-in-law.
Well then, he’s God’s soldier now!
Where’s my notebook?—It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile, and be a villain.
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him.
Some good friend of his must have died, because nothing else in the world could change a man so much.
You say you have news that’s old?
Do you know me?
Caesar is upset.
But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls.
No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink.
Don’t be sad that this happened because of you, because Lady Luck’s been nicer to me than usual.
There are women like that out there, no question.
Where’s Metellus Cimber?
I do too, my lord.
Speak, man, what’s the matter?
If you don’t want to, then good riddance.
If it were, you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I’d sold my farm to buy my crown.
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen.” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse, which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply.
Okay, bring on the play.
I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons.
What you were afraid of has happened.
If the news is good, you’re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that.
So, in the name of God and all the good that will come of this 
Answer all of us, now.
You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death.
Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom.
You never heard of the Centaur?
So shut up!
Oh, no!
But I’m ashamed to kiss, sir.
You have to read us the will, Caesar’s will.
Hortensio, what’s all this about?
Come here, you.
I loved this man so much it makes me weep.
I wish some god could help me choose!
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage.
Ah, dear Nature, my goddess, listen to me!
I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out.
Punish me if it’s not true.
Both, both, my girl.
Listen they’re howling.
No, he just smiles.
Why, what are you afraid of?
As I remember, Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy.
A man named Iago, the general’s ensign.
I’ll find him right away, sir, and carry out the business as well as I can.
So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight?
I’ll test it out.
Follow them, please.
For three months, hmmm.
Ma'am, my master’s coming.
My God, what a great song!
There are only friends here.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Definitely not.
When did she send you?
Be careful not to fall in.
Farewell, my lord.
The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.
I got it from you—I never said I didn’t.
Yes, sir, we’re part of her entourage.
I want to be this Duke’s servant.
It’s coming toward me.
It’s true she looked at me a lot, in fact, she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted, and couldn’t really finish her sentences very well.
If there’s any reason we shouldn’t get married, I urge you to tell me.
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke.
It’s very strange.
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face, you cowardly boy.
The French have reinforced their scattered men.
The women you rape are the ones who’ll have to “sense” it.
Damn you!
They’re good enough to drink in, and so are these boots.
To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house.
Don’t ask me anything.
We’ll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry, and we’ll mock him till he’s black and blue.
Your physical health matters more than your reputation.
Mountains don’t tremble, however much the wind may blow!
If God will be revenged for this deed, he will do it publicly.
We’ll hurry.
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks.
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes.
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad.
That’s completely beside the point.
My grandmother told me he was murdered there.
No, we’ll all go there to bring him.
But his frail heart, too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness, gave out.
They have me tied to a stake.
Yes, my lord.
And that’s everything, Leonato.—Claudio, Benedick—my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina.
And who is England’s king but an heir of the great York?
Two great enemies, in fact, enemies to my peace of mind.
Be quiet, you mumbling fool!
I will mourn Hero tonight.  
Farewell.
And my poor  He’s fainted.—My lord, my lord!
Greetings, good general!
And you won’t until the needy eat.
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow’s feather from the poison swamps.
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here.
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them.
That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one.
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes, my lord.
A thing of no importance.
Her name is Portia.
An excellent motion.
Meanwhile, I’d be gratified if you’d live and eat your food.
You’ll have to leave tonight.
When he loses that, he’ll be drinking salt water, since I’ll never tell him where the freshwater springs are.
He’s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea, or make the sea flood the earth—he wants to see the world return to primal chaos.
Ha, ha, ha!
Yes, right away.
Sure I can, father.
I’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight.
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you, making the pine tree open and let you out.
Yes, madam, but he’ll be back tonight.
With God as my witness, I swear I have wept for yours.
He swore that he’d never get married, but now, despite his earlier protestations, he loves ungrudgingly.
Is the building of your love already in ruins?
Is this the family tomb of Leonato?
Look, here comes our honored hostess!
Tonight let’s have plenty to eat.
Before I learn how to love, I’ll learn how to follow orders.
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time.
I didn’t give her any ring.
Tell me what a drunk is like, fool.
And what’s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently?
I have bankrupted three tailors.
He’d begged me to steal it many times.
Mistress, think about your end—beware of your death!
You speak absolutely correctly, sir.
This is for your master’s sake, not mine.
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are, my life insurance rates would be sky high.
I’ve lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I’ll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow.—Well, jailer, let’s go.—I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt.
I’ll say goodbye once more.
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time?
Come on.
Gentlemen, I hope you are well.
Well, I’ll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing.
I will go out.
Amen to that.
I’ve served you since childhood, but I’ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop.
I know it.
I’ll go and join my men.
It was obviously a hit.
They swore that you were sick with love for me.
I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.
I tell you, they are not honest men.
Don’t let that lawyer ever come near my house!
There’s always a breath of fresh air here.
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.
Before he leaves this part of the forest, you’ll change places: you’ll be the one running away, and he’ll be in love with you.
You wrong me, Brutus.
Ever since Cordelia left for France, sir, the fool has been depressed.
Were you ever at court, shepherd?
What would you like me to do at Salisbury?
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart?
Just as I did with the meat, I’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made, and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other, and the blanket over here and the sheets over there.
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause.
Tell me, Fluellen: did you just come from the bridge?
I’ll give my life for you, just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don’t love you.
I see you don’t intend to part with her—or perhaps you don’t like my company.
I never saw my father in my life.
Poor Harry of England!
Most noble sir, stand up.
Your light dulls when he is near.
Yes, but no doctor can help me.
It’s true.
Now he’ll sit under a  Let’s go.
I’ll teach you a lesson.
Lysander I want to stop, but Hermia stops my heart from beating.
I’ll scalp you.
My master’s a total Jew.
Look!
Damn my soul if these accusations are true!
We can’t waste time between now and six o'clock.
How?
Someday you can get revenge.—Oh, you bastard!
Let me tell you, friends—
You’ve killed an innocent woman, and you’re going to pay dearly for her death.
In bed with her?
Let me see his face.
Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife!
I cannot live without her.
Well, to wear out their shoes and get myself more work.
Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you.
Very well, thank you.
Where’s my fool?—Go call my fool and have him come here.
What are these warlike noises?
Goodbye.
Barnardo’s taken my place.
It is.
Won’t we, Sir Andrew?
Say, “That splendid Antony.” The courageous Caesar!
Oh Friar, damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell.
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest?
I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about.
Which two crowns would those be?
Don’t be cruel, Demetrius.
He claimed he knew that, and that’s why he’s come to speak with you.
Your love says, like an honorable gentleman, 'Where is your mother?
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown, but I didn’t ask him to cut it all to pieces.
Raise all the money you can.
No, my cousin, don’t wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead.
Oh, life is full of surprises!
Is this the Prince?
Look, if you love me, stay.
If you won’t leave, then 
If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work.
Where are you going?
Please let me go.
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo.
They’re murdering Caesar!” Who’s there?
Because he’s daring us to do it.
Hurry, hurry—prepare my horse.
Really, young men, though it wasn’t a very hard song to get right, the music was still all out of tune.
Didn’t feel like it?
Give me a kiss.
Leave me alone.
Why stay when love tells you to go?
Tell me where you live.
Your logic is so foolish.
But now I must condemn it.
You are an honest man.
Please take them.
Pish!
Where’s my father?
But major issues must come before minor ones.
Who greets me so early in the morning?
If I don’t answer, perhaps you’ll think I’m accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me.
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they’re going to do and won’t back down?
Please do, madam.
Well, even if he is her father, I’m sure she wouldn’t want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders!
Didn’t you tell me that I’d be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing?
And buried, noble Tyrrel?
Now I’ll believe that unicorns exist, and that there’s a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives.
Do you think you’ve won?
Let me be captured.
Come on, sir.
You must be over there.
I’ll tell you, Cassius, you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold.
But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?
Very obedient—keep crying.—Concerning this—oh, what fake emotion!—I am being ordered home—Get away from me, I’ll send for you later.—Sir, I’ll obey the order and return to Venice.
Madam, I am not well.
Be quick about it.
Let’s get out of here!
Lead them inside.
Easy, Petruchio.
Dear woman, you don’t know the rules of charity.
Ah-ha!
Yes, yes.
As his body grows uglier with age, his mind rots away as well.
My good qualities, my legal status as Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me.
Good girl, give it to me.
Now I’ve done a good day’s work.
Why are you giving me his title?
Make your confession short.
We have enough supplies for it, and they’ve earned it.
I’m not going to be bothered by you for long.
Let me choose now.
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him, and I laughed and refused to flee with him.
Don’t wrong her birth.
I’ll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past.
I should have known it.
What an ass I am.
You say you don’t know what the girl thinks.
It wants us to speak to it.
I don’t understand.
Be on guard duty tonight.
When you ask for my blessing, I’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me.
Hello, good sir.
If you’ve offended him, I’ll fight you.
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself.
Look, he can become invisible.
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
Everyone can see that, and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now.
He can’t like her very long.
But I’ll deliver Sir Andrew’s challenge by word of mouth, describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious, impetuous, and a skilled fighter (he’ll believe me because he’s young).
Her once-trimmed hedges, like prisoners with wild, untended hair, put forth unruly twigs.
To work as a servant.
Stay here for a moment.
Will no one back me up?
Now I’m Dromio and no longer attached to him.
But you began so rudely.
Stop that alarm from ringing, it’s scaring the islanders.
You have bested many things, well don’t try and best me.
So please listen to me.
They swore you did.
Yes, right now.
Music!
Not a second more.
What did you say to me?
This is Antonio, my dearest friend.
And like I am for no woman.
We want answers.
Wait!
That’s why there must be space between you. 
Did you call me, my lord?
Caliban, who now serves me.
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him.
God gives those gifts—I had nothing to do with it.
Don’t bother us up here.
Is my ink and paper ready?
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands.
It is.
I know what you’d do.
Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience?
You’re a spirit, I know.
Great Mark Antony is a widower now.
I leave a slimy bastard with you, your Worship, for you to punish and make an example of.
You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence.
That’s true, and with good reason.
First, you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them.
Seriously, cousin, I love a woman.
Everything would be produced without labor, and would be shared by all.
I was telling you to go after her, woo her, confront her.
Hello.
This is the Dauphin’s message.
How are you, sir?
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock.
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower.
A god of a god?
You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke, if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens.
I bet I’ve been wrong about myself all this time.
You’re not going to take him.
Do you know his plans?
He won’t catch a wink of sleep, either at night or during the day.
Winter garments need to be filled with something, And so does skinny Rosalind.
Delay this marriage for a month, or a week.
Even if you’re not a traitor, you’re going to look like one if you run away.
You’ll be ashamed of this forever!
Who can explain this to me?
Right over to that  I hope he enjoys her.
There’s a husband there who’s waiting to make you his wife.
Thank you.
Oh, damn her, damn her!
My lord, when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter.
Please do.
Tybalt, I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult.
She speaks my language!
Hound or spaniel, bitch or dog, Whether your tail is short or curly— Tom will make you cry and wail.
Do as I tell you.
Like the  Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper.
And I’ll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn.
Who is so low that he wouldn’t?
Yes, even if I had a thousand more pounds than that, for I hear that you are  Me, too.
It’s very hot.
You should pity me for that reason, not hate me.
Don’t come in here, uncle!
Didn’t you talk to it?
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight.
Come, let’s have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans.
But wait a moment.
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again.
I’ve never heard of that.
The king made peace among all of us.
I wish I could see that man someday!
Instead of Celia, call me Aliena.
It’s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that.
I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by anyone born from a woman.
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him.
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women?
Or like a whale.
Whip me, you devils, so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight!
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression, nor has the long, sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color.
We’ve seen the best our age has to offer.
How’s my nephew doing, noble lord of York?
Let’s move again, my friends.
Look, here comes the fool.
Show.
Let’s get started right away.
May the gods be with you.
No.
Or should we enter without apologizing?
Although many people said she looked like me, she was considered beautiful.
Your royal father is murdered.
I have to do it, I have to do it.
Good night, good night.
Is the worst well?
Why, then, should I cry?
Get away from me!
Why not!
That’s true, that’s very true.
No, really, I don’t.
Come on, tie them up.
Are you with a Cornish company?
Goodbye, you beautiful, cruel woman.
I think that’s strange.
He brings me freedom.
But you don’t look as if you bring good news.
Anyway, I have to say goodbye to you now.
I will.
Oh!
My lord, it’s news I wish I didn’t have to report.
She’ll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up—even if it’s a lion, a bear, a wolf, a bull, a monkey, or an ape.
Revenge!
I’m going far enough that I’ll be riding from now until dinner.
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool, paint your face with blood, and make a fool out of you.
I’ll give you cramps for saying that—horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing.
What are you  Nothing.
Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but it’ll never destroy my love.
I am friends with you all and love you all, on one condition—that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous.
So goodbye, my lady.
So, what’s the news on the Rialto?
You are very welcome here, sir. 
Greetings, Caesar, my lord!
Why,
Why, that’s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions.
I use it all the time, since it’s all that I have.
Explain.
Yes, indeed, it was, and he pushed it away three times, each time more gently than the last; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted.
And the greatest sorrow is mine too.
I’ll go as fast as I can, madam.
I don’t doubt your wisdom.
I don’t even know how much I’m spending to find them.
With that, I hope God is with him!
Hortensio, have you come to break up the fight?
Orsino.
Is love really tender?
What, are you moaning on about your toothache?
Oh, traitors, villains!
Then I beat my drum, at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes, looking around for the source of my music.
What’s that?
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately.
And I hope you won’t think badly of me.
Signior Leonato, listen to the friar’s plan.
If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little the worse for drink, killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage, see.
That’s the truth, sir.
You must be mistaking me for someone else, sir.
I have no choice.
We’ll outwit them all—that old geezer, Gremio; the suspicious father, Minola; the prim musician lover, Litio—all for the sake of my master, Lucentio.
I hate no-good drunks.
Who put out the light?
You lie, you nasty, ungrateful thing!
If you like, Brakenbury, you can listen to anything we say.
This epitaph will hang here forever, Continuing to praise Hero after I die.
Before the bat flies through the castle, and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it’s nighttime, a dreadful deed will be done.
Orlando, my lord, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
The Hero that died!
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles.
I’ve got her now, but I’ve got God to thank for it!
Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell!
Are you backing away in fear?
What’s that noise?
Yes, the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him.
Oh, what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young.
Look, here comes the woman you love.
I just did my duty, sir.
I’m no villain.
And so do I. I think we all do.
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush.
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes!
You are in a perilous state, shepherd.
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that.
Yes, right away.
I’m the one, Hamlet.
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God!
He really was tricked horribly.
Let life be short so that shame won’t last too long.
Find the people whose names are on this list?
What are we going to do, Enobarbus?
Follow her.
Besides, she treats me more respectfully than the other servants.
Help me out of here.
That’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed.
Where’s my cousin Toby?
Go, get out!
Remain calm until midnight, and then you’ll see what the trouble is.
Even the goddess of patience couldn’t look at this and be patient—it’s too horrifying!
The law’s on my side.
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head, too.
She’ll confirm everything.
There isn’t enough leek left for you to swear on.
So cheer up.
Was there ever a match put together so quickly?
You are what’s left of the noblest man that ever lived.
Amen to that!
I’ll be crippled forever!
But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer.
You look happier already, and I’ll be back quickly.
But what’s this I see?
I’ve found it out.
Yes, I’m sure he will—to stay with you.
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool!
That’s what I’m doing.
For shame, bring Juliet out here.
Which of us are you referring to?
I’m your daughter.
Why, may I ask?
Sweet Hero; when I imagine you now, you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you.
He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him.
Is that you, Diomedes?
I have no doubt about that, since I know there isn’t a man among us who isn’t with me wholeheartedly, or a soul left behind who doesn’t wish us success and conquest.
I’ll go too and make sure that happens.
At least I don’t have a horse for my mistress—or a saying so beside the point.
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream, and even when you were awake, it was as though you slept.
You told me she got them, and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon, but nothing like that ever happens.
Don’t talk to me.
We’ll go together, and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth, we’ll find a way to make a living.
Be happy about it.
Answer me in a word.
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles?
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome?
Yes, as safe as her brothers' lives were.
The reason I think he’s insane, besides the way he just acted, is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house.
Come on, I’ll escort you to dinner.
Keep your voice down.
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it?
But I wish I could say that’s the last time he’ll do it!
I swear by my sword— Swear by your shield, too!
Listen!
Oh, I see, you will only part with lightweight presents.
Swearing is for priests, cowards, overly cautious men, feeble old people, and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse.
Do this immediately, and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways.
Since your woes are only a portion of mine, I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own.
The duke’s trumpets.
No, don’t press up against me.
Look who’s coming: a young man and an old man, having a serious talk.
Whoo-hoo!
I have no desire to go outside, yet something leads me there.
Tell us, Othello.
I’ll recognize him all right, I’m sure of it.
When you avoid one trap, you fall into another.
What is fated to happen must happen.
Unless my horse goes faster than expected, I will be back an hour or two after sunset.
I hear it now overhead.
Farewell.
If we lose this battle, this is the last time we’ll speak to each other.
To be honest, I don’t know why I’m so sad.
It cannot be.
I have.
Take him safely through the lines.
I’ll get there.
Tybalt was my nephew!
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn’t been for his love affair with Shore’s wife, I would never have suspected him.
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose.
I don’t know.
Enough!
Enough.
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately?
Well, I’ll get my revenge.
He hasn’t arrived yet.
Did you hear her speak?
I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart.
It’s only for your willing and receptive ear.
Just as I told you, he usually sleeps in the afternoon.
But people often screw things up trying to make them better.
I wish we were safely on board our ship already.
Not me, believe me.
But I didn’t want to be free like this.
He’s not brave enough to be wise.
Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts.
I represent her.
Otherwise, I’ll do it anytime, as long as I’m able.
Lord, it’s glancing every which way!
I am.
No.
What, is the man insane?    
Madam, if I do as well as I think I’m going to do in these dangerous, violent wars, you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you’ve ever had bad!
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.
Here’s what you’ll do.
Hell and damnation!
And when the mind is engaged, the rest of the body, dead and dull before, wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity, like a snake shedding its dead skin.
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen.
Believe me, I’m sorry you’re in pain.
I’ll fetch him.
Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes.
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds, while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting.
Next time I’ll give you nothing for something.
You don’t wish we had more help from England anymore, cousin?
Who’s in there?
I beg your pardon.
This isn’t a monster, it’s a devil.
Look, here he comes.
Look what I have here.
I’m sure he’s somewhere on the island.
Go ahead, I’ll yield to your power.
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak, like women.
Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe.
Please Margaret, help me write this poem for Beatrice.
So don’t spend one night away from this house.
Come, come, let’s remember why we’re here.
I’ll go, sir, and I won’t bother you.
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much?
My lord of Gloucester, I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long.
Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house?
And so he fainted.
The king is virtuous and kind.
They’re ready, my lord.
Well, good-bye, Portia.
The king loves you very much.
Good-bye.
But will my Rosalind do this, too?
Please go, sir.
Oh, that arrow was well shot.
So if we know that a man is a thief, should we try to arrest him?
Is the king dead, the empire dispossessed?
I must hide in the darkness for awhile.
That’s our offer.
I’ll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf, so that he’ll meet you on the way.
To prison, until you’re called into court.
Go around the forest, moving faster than the wind, and make sure you find Helena of Athens.—She’s lovesick, and her face is pale from all the sighing she’s been doing, because sighing is bad for the blood.
Revise your statement, or you may damage your inheritance.
Stand away from the hearse.
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body.
Right or not, it’s made you the Earl of Gloucester.
I’m not.
Ha, ha, ha!
Who’s calling me?
I don’t know you.
But, oh, heavenly Rosalind!
That way, the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire.
And also to find out the size of the enemy army.
Pharmacist!
This looks like an abbey.
Beware of March 15th.
I won’t either, sir.
And listen!
You hear the charges.
Hold the friar too.
Enough of this frivolous talk.
The devil’s after me!
I’m still young enough to see without glasses, and I don’t see what you’re talking about.
Nothing but “little” and “short”!— Why are you letting her insult me like this?
What’s the matter?
My daughter married death.
Well, Oswald?
Now you’re talking.
How about the mustard without the beef.
She’s dead, I think.—Help, uncle!—Hero, why Hero!
If they aren’t, they can go hang themselves by their own laces!
You mean you don’t even want to hear my side?
She’s mine, and I’m giving her to Demetrius.  
That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny.
And how would we go about doing that?
These are unnatural events.
You’re right, sir.
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was.
My dear sir!
Are you starting to challenge me?
I am being serious, my lord.
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning?
If I answered that question, I’d be making confession to you.
The king, the king’s to blame.
For assuredly, you are so near the abyss that you’re bound to be swallowed up.
They’re friends—Ratcliffe and Lovell.
Signior Balthasar, you look upset.
He’s a lord to a lord and a man to a man.
Wait!
Tomorrow is the happy day, Audrey.
Those are the things we pine for now.
His legs aren’t great, but they’re alright.
Well, there you go.
You’ll live in luxury with Gremio.
Two or three men are groaning.
Where have you been, my bravery?
She says all the right things, but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story.
No, my dear, you were a little angel who kept me going.
But I’ll tell you something from my soul.
The problem is in what the letter says, as far as I can tell.
Thank you.
Look at the three little dogs, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart—all barking at me.
Metellus Cimber?
What a strange sight—a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home!
Don’t listen to him, Emilia, even though he’s your husband.
Quiet!
If you remember your life before you came here, you may also remember how you got here.
So go ahead and cry.
Welcome to the open air again.
Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more.
Whip him!
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich.
Silver.
Nell.
Oh, correct it completely.
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats.  
So we are in agreement.
Yes, I am the one.
You’re right—I’ll go quietly.
Where is she now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No more of that, my lord, no more of that.
I am the youngest man by that name, because there is no one younger, or worse.
Many people faint when they see blood.
Here’s the money you asked me to hold.
But if you see a wheel going uphill, latch on for the ride.
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him.
More than anything else in the world, I love you, value you, and honor you.
Here.
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles, or rabbits frighten a lion.
Goodbye.
Oh God!—Oh Nurse, how can this be stopped?
I’m going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster.
They’re certainly a peaceful couple!
I have no idea how.
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude, not as a fee.
But you won’t take his flesh if he can’t pay.
By next week, I’ll be able to pay you.
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree.
Have you heard of me, most noble Empress?
Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me.
The saddle maker has it, sir—I didn’t keep it.
If you don’t, if I’m left alone, I swear I’ll have that legal expert as my bedfellow.
You’re like the poor cat in the old story.
Did old Bellario send you here?
I am content, if that’s the way you want it.
How are you feeling, Malvolio?
Just come again tomorrow.
I haven’t seen him for two days.
I have a  That’s from lack of sleep.
Good father, I’m begging you on my knees, be patient and listen to me say just one thing.
They were traitors.
Give me one,” I said.
My husband.
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little.
Not bad; you might accomplish something.
But I’m as noble as my opponent.
The devil in him is strong!
Alas, grim death, how vile and ugly your near-twin, sleep, is!
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax, stooped over with old age and ill will?
I’ll go tell the king about this.
To hell with you!
They’re playing with me.
I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before.
Just a man, like any other.
He is what he is.
Think about it.
I’ll fight every one of these devils if I have to, one at a time.
Excellent, good.
Call up your courage.
Killing him once is not enough revenge.
I’ll recite something for you, guy.
Tell me seriously, who is the one you love?
Virtue turns to vice if it’s misused.
I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid.
I’ll remember.
Put a candle in my study, Lucius.
The will, the will!
Give me my money and let me go.
Anyway, he is what he is.
That was too much.
I’m starting to lose my mind.
Now that I think about it, Maria was the one who first told me you were insane.
Why are you still crying?
Oh, she’s so witty and creative!
No, who are  Long live the king!
What else is love?
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus?
In God’s name, who are you?
What, you don’t say a word?
If she sends any letters to Richmond, you will be accountable to me for it.
Very suspicious.
It’s a reason for suspicion, even though it’s just a dream.
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me, I wouldn’t have let him influence me.
Weren’t you ordered, on penalty of— Why Dover?—Let him answer that question first.
Yes, Desdemona.
All this so suddenly?—Edmund, what’s going on?
While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled.
And like I am for Rosalind.
What do kings have that private men do not, besides the pomp of their position?
A lively young one!
Where should we meet?
Who’s sounding that alarm?
What you wanted is yours.
Hey, hey!
Ask her to help you get back your position.
You may, sir.
So that she may live, I’ll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child.
Oh, oh, Edmund, I don’t like this monstrous business.
Is the throne empty?
As we were trading blows, more and more people showed up to join the fight, until the Prince came and broke everyone up.
Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me.
Speak up and tell me!
Is this your good friend who’s in so much trouble?
My brother is in heaven.
Since he has the jewel I loved, which you swore you’d keep forever, I’ll be as generous as you were to him.
If you want to pick a fight, you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse.
I am a villain.
Don’t say anything.
What, does your wife say you can come home?
She’s so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician.
Virtue is beauty, but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil.
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations.
He says she has no equal.
Why, how could she have been murdered?
You know what, my lord?
I have a favor to ask.
What else?
Don’t kneel, noble Portia.  
I found them on a tree.
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
Peter, did you ever see anything like it?
This place is full of trouble, torments, and amazements.
But our courage should only be the greater for that.
Here are the keys, and there is the duke, sleeping.
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths, but the good is often buried with them.
Will you marry us here, under this tree, or should we follow you to your chapel?
I’ll let you know my answer shortly.
Taurus!
Why do you ask?
Draw your sword!
Tell me, are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet?
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided.
Did it really work?
You did.
You’re a traveler.
Terrible.
You are too expensive to wear every day.
Look, how she blushes like a virgin!
Is this true?
I’m sorry I hit you.
Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly, and so did I.
I am their mother.
Gentle boy, good night.
Actually, it’s not so unusual when you think about it.
My lord, what’s wrong with you?
Is he dead?
When you are gentle, you shall have one, too, and not till then.
Well, because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count’s messenger better than she’s ever treated me.
Sure, and twenty others just like you.
So find someone younger to love, or you won’t be able to maintain your feelings.
I showed it to you once.
This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior.
She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me.
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit.
Goodbye, nymph.
But I am thankful that you have found it.
What color is her hair?
You think he’s special, since you’ve only ever seen him and Caliban.
When we’re by ourselves you can call me “Tranio.” Everywhere else, address me as your master Lucentio.
You don’t know that?
I don’t understand—how should I answer that?
You’re a good judge of horsemanship.
As sane as me?
Little birds do it, and dragonflies copulate right in front of me.
My vision is dull.
Do they come from good families?
I saw him once.
I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.
He’s a marvelously witty fellow, no doubt, but I’ll outmaneuver him.—Come over here; I’ll whisper a word in your ear.
Take his sword away from him.
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it.
Who’s that?
But he’s young, and as long as he’s too young to become king, Richard, the duke of Gloucester, has power over him.
We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration!
Hello there, sir!
Let’s see here.
May God be at your table.
How did you get this letter?
Put the torch out, so I can’t be seen.
Who do you mean?
Within an hour, one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder.
I wish I were in an alehouse in London!
But brother Anthony— Don’t, it’s no big deal.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I hired to perform the butchery, are used to killing people, the bloody dogs.
I’ll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard, or a sandy beard, or a red beard, or one of those bright yellow beards that’s the color of a French coin.
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon.
I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return.
May good luck follow you!
Who’s there?
She provoked me with her lying mouth, accusing me of crimes I didn’t commit.
How literal this guy is!
Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width.
Usually that means a person is foolish.
Tell me if it’s good or bad, and I’ll wait for the details.
The king of Naples, my arch-enemy, listens to my brother’s request, which was that the king, in exchange for the respect and money paid to him, would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead.
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Yes sir, thank God.
And here comes father.
I swear, anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester’s apprentice.
He says he’ll come.
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform.
But often in these cases, reports are just estimates.
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real.
You were worn with honor. 
My situation is desperate.
He was happy here, listening to a song.
Let’s put our heads together.
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts.
I sincerely hope it does you good, mangy rascal.
Please go to him, my friend.
But it can’t help either!
Goodbye, you dumb old spirit.
What a long night this is!
They’re all welcome.
What’s your name?
I’m not feeling well—that’s all.
We are fortunate in the change.
I must and will have Katherine for my wife.
I promise I will.
That’s Cassio’s voice.
You’re this poor and wretched and still afraid to die?
Yes, Petruchio.
Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her.
Young girls call it “love-in-idleness.” Bring me that flower.
You old traitor, repent all your sins.
Yes, he did.
I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want.
You’re a fool.
I’ll go straight for that proverb with “To hell with the devil.” You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as “A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark.” You have overshot.
Hey!
Bottom!
She’s full of good intentions.
Speak, my fair one, and speak fairly, I beg you.
Oh, the world never saw a sweeter creature.
My liege, this man is a villain and a traitor, who—see, your Grace—has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alençon’s helmet.
Unless you’re talking about his love for this kind of foolishness—which, judging from his appearance, he has—he is no fool for love, as you pretend.
If not, I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business.
Oh, I thank my lucky stars, I’m so happy.
Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead.
Where are the noble Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
That you lift the death sentence on my servant, who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk.
I was reminded of my son, even though I despised my son at that time.
What color, madam?
Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man.
It’s all the same.
A little before twelve, I think.
I would rather wrong the dead, and wrong myself and you, than wrong such honorable men.
What did he do to you?
I’ll take you to where he sleeps, and you can pound a nail into his head.
I’ll come back.
How old is she?
How excellent for Antony!
He’s his mother’s child from head to toe.
I tell you, you’ve ruined her gown.
Your sister’s sister.
So will I.
Here I go.
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking.
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out, presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music.
What do you want?
Tell me, good grandmother, is our father dead?
What should I pay you?
The biggest clue is his seriousness.
Read the will!
Ha!
It’s no time for jokes: sober up.
Noble people don’t answer to peasants!
Thanks, my dear lord.
Yes, sir.
Read it.
She’s shut inside a dead man’s tomb!
Be brave and do well!
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell.
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far.
We’re ready for both, my lord.
Go away and take your children.
Bianca’s love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town.
She was fickle and unfaithful, like water.
I’ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there.
You’re a hardworking villain who’d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to.
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons.
Sir, I’m upset.
He ate at my house, but that doesn’t make me nervous.
All that glitters is not gold— You’ve often heard that said.
Then take this man into your service, Octavius, for he did the final service to my master.
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot, who lives with him, is still there?
Now I’m in a great hurry, as I’m sure you can see.
Right now?
It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized.
Here they come.
But, really, what’s going on, Clarence?
I’ll say you’re not feeling well.
Yoo-hoo!
I am the duke who loved your father.
If you do, please give it to me, because I need to start learning the lines.
How are you, Hero?
We 
Come, come with me, and we’ll do the job quickly.
My lord?
Hello, Curan.
That’s what I want you to tell me.
Bring me his answers quickly.
As a friend or an enemy?
Monster sweetie, be a good monster and just speak once.
Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet.
How much does he owe the Jew?
What, are you hurt?
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest, looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot, and I scolded her and argued with her.
I do suffer love, because I love you against my will.
