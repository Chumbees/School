I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again.
But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls.
Madam, he’s well.
That’s well spoken.
And he’s friendly with Caesar.
You are an honest man.
Caesar and he are better friends than ever.
I’m going to make you a rich man.
But yet, madam— I don’t like the sound of “but yet.” It reverses all the good that came before it.
Damn those words, “but yet!” “But yet” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal.
Please, my friend, give me all the news, both good and bad, at the same time.
You say he’s friendly with Caesar, healthy, and free.
I didn’t say free, madam.
No, I didn’t say that.
He’s bound to Octavia.
For what favor?
For the favor of sleeping in her bed.
I’m sick, Charmian.
He’s married to Octavia, madam.
May you die of the worst disease!
Good madam, be patient.
What did you say to me?
Get out, you horrible bastard, or I’ll gouge out your eyes.
I’ll scalp you.
I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle, making your pain linger.
If you say it isn’t true, I’ll give you a province and make you rich.
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me.
He’s married, madam.
Rogue, you’ve lived too long!
No way, then, I’ll run.
What’s the matter with you, madam?
I haven’t done anything to you.
Good madam, restrain yourself.
The man hasn’t done anything wrong.
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster.
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes.
Call that servant back.
Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him.
Call him!
He’s afraid to come in.
I won’t hurt him.
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior, especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress.
Come here, sir.
It may be honest, but it’s never wise to bring bad news.
You can give good news in many ways, but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it.
I’ve only done my duty.
Is he married?
May the gods destroy you!
Do you maintain the same story?
Do you want me to lie, madam?
Go, get out!
Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness’ pardon.
Is he really married?
Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more.
It’s not fair to punish me for something you make me do.
He’s married to Octavia.
It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk.
Go away.
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me.
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you.
Be patient, your highness.
When I have praised Antony, I’ve disparaged Caesar.
Many times, madam.
I’m being repaid for that now.
Help me out of here.
Oh, Iras, Charmian!
It doesn’t matter.
How old is she?
Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair.
Bring me his answers quickly.
Even though half of him is like a 
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost the most consummate Alexas, where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen?
Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife!
I don’t make fortunes; I only see them.
Then see a good one for me.
No, he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old.
May my wrinkles forbid that!
Don’t joke about his predictions.
Pay attention.
Quiet!
You will love more than you are loved.
It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration.
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar?
Take your time.
Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy.
We’ll meet you at sea.
Yes, on land you do outnumber me.
Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands.
But since,  To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal?
That’s the point.
Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers.
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia.
In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome.
If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.
That’s our offer.
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer.
Let me shake your hand.
I didn’t think I would see you here.
The East is very seductive.
Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage. 
It’s good we had this meeting.
I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus.
So we are in agreement.
That’s the next thing on the agenda.
We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways.
I’ll give the first one, Pompey.
No, Antony.
Whether your banquet is first or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best.
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there.
You’ve heard a lot.
I mean well, sir.
I’m sure you do.
I’ve heard a lot more.
I heard that Apollodorus carried—   What did he carry, please?
How are you, soldier?
I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared. 
Let me shake your hand.
I’ve never been your enemy.
I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill.
Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave.
Enjoy your frankness; it suits you.
I invite you all aboard my ship.
After you, my lords?
Show us the way, sir.
Come with me.
I think it was at sea.
That it was, sir.
You’ve done well at sea.
And you’ve done well on land.
I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied.
Neither can my accomplishments at sea.
Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea.
As you were on land.
That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny.
But let’s shake hands, Menas.
If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing.
Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.
But no beautiful woman has an honest face.
That’s no lie.
They steal hearts.
We came here to fight against you.
For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.
If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.
That’s the truth, sir.
We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here.
Is he married to Cleopatra?
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.
That’s true, sir.
She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife.
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.
Excuse me, sir?
It’s true.
Then Caesar and he will always be united.
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that.
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love.
I think so too.
But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them.
Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition.
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?
Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony.
He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish.
Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them.
Antony will go where his passion is.
He only married out of political necessity.
Then that’s the way it may turn out.
Come on, sir, will you come aboard?
I want to drink your health.
I’ll join you, sir.
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.
Let’s go.
Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor.
Some of them are leaning already.
Lepidus is red in the face.
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor.
I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift.
This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid.
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty.
The higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest.
The harvest comes shortly after that.
Do you have unusual snakes there?
Yes, Lepidus.
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud, just like the crocodile.
I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop.
Not until you pass out.
I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then.
I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid.
Without doubt I’ve heard that.
What does a crocodile look like?
Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width.
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs.
Its own color.
It’s a strange snake.
It is that.
And its tears are wet.
What is it?
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.
You’ve served me faithfully.
What else can I say?
What are you saying?
Would you like to be king of the entire world?
Now I’ve said it twice.
How could that happen?
Just listen to him.
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune.
Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them.
Oh, excellent!
Then my children will probably be illegitimate.
Tell me, please: how many boys and girls will I have?
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one, you would have a million children.
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.
We’ll all want our fortune told.
My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed.  
Are you drunk?
No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink.
Tell me how.
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat.
Everything that belongs to them is yours.
Oh, you should have done it without telling me!
For you to do it would be good service.
You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around.
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions.
But now I must condemn it.
Give it up and go drink.  
This toast is for Lepidus!
Here’s to you, Menas.
I accept with thanks, Enobarbus.
There goes a strong fellow, Menas.
Why do you say that?
He carries a third of the world.
Can’t you see that?
Then a third of the world is drunk.
Drink up.
All right, then.
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet.
It’s getting there.
Clink your cups together in a toast!
Here’s to Caesar.
I could do without another toast.
Live in the moment.
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one.
Let’s have one, good soldier.
Come, let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful.
Everyone join hands.
How can you top that?
Good night, Pompey. 
Yes, we will.
Let’s shake on it.
We’re friends!
Come, this way to the rowboat.
Be careful not to fall in.
Menas, I’m not going back on shore.
No, come to my cabin.
What do you say?
There’s my hat!
Hooray!
Come on, noble captain.
Now I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death.
You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence.
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person.
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival.
I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him.
A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius.
Are you going to write Antony about this?
I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia.
Where’s Antony now?
Did the brothers-in-law leave?
They finished their business with Pompey, and Pompey has left.
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome.
Caesar is in a sober mood.
He’s a stylish man.
And how he loves Caesar!
Yes, but how he adores Mark Antony!
Caesar?
Then what’s Antony?
A god of a god?
Are you talking about Caesar?
He’s without equal!
Oh, Antony!
Oh, you  If you want to praise Caesar, just say his name—that’s all the praise that’s necessary.
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments.
He loves Caesar best, but he also loves Antony.
Oh!
Hearts cannot think it, tongues cannot speak it, meas-urements cannot calculate it, scribes cannot write it, bards cannot sing it, and poets cannot make verses about it.
He loves them both.
They are his dung, and he their beetle.
So, there’s the signal to ride.
Good-bye, noble Agrippa.
Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye.
You can’t go any further with us, sir.
If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her.
Don’t insult me with your distrust.
I mean what I say.
You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one.
So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support.
We’ll leave you here. 
Good-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye.
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease.
Farewell.
My noble brother!
Her eyes are like April: full of showers.
What is it, Octavia?
I’ll tell you privately.
See, now I have you.
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods.
Good-bye.
Be happy.
Farewell, farewell.
Farewell.
Like the  Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper.
You can’t see the future.
Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear.
Your fortunes are the same.
But how?
Give me details.
I’ve said what I have to say.
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers?
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
Not in my husband’s nose.
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts!
Alexas!
If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful.
Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.
Where is that messenger?
He’s afraid to come in.
Oh, come on.—Come here, sir.
Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood.
I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off!
Most formidable Queen!
Did you see Octavia?
Yes, revered Queen.
Where?
In Rome, Madam.
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony.
Is she as tall as I am?
She is not, madam.
Did you hear her speak?
Is her voice pitched high or low?
Madam, I heard her speak.
She has a low-pitched voice.
That’s not in her favor.
He can’t like her very long.
Like her?
Oh, Isis, that’s impossible.
You’re right, Charmian.
She creeps along.
She has a body, not a life.
Is this true?
If not, then I have no powers of observation.
There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better.
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far.
This messenger is wise.
Very wise.
Do you hear that, Charmian?
And I think she’s at least thirty.
Do you remember her face?
Was it long or round?
Round enough to be unattractive.
Usually that means a person is foolish.
What color is her hair?
Brown, madam, and she wouldn’t want her forehead to be any lower.
You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me.
I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome.
My letters are ready to go.
He’s an admirable man.
He certainly is.
I’m very sorry I was so hard on him.
Not a bit, madam.
Everything may still be all right.
I assure you it is, madam.
Oh, dear husband, don’t believe everything you hear—or if you must believe it, don’t let it all make you angry.
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree.
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you.
In the meantime, I’ll raise an army that will surpass his.
May the god of power make me, the weakest of the weak, your mediator.
When you find out who started this disagreement, turn your anger upon them.
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions.
How goes it, friend Eros?
Some startling news has just arrived, sir.
What news, man?
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey.
That’s old news.
Who’s winning?
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him.
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them, they’ll battle each other to the death to have it all.
Where’s Antony?
Another thing, Domitius: Antony wants to see you now.
I should have waited to tell you my news.
But never mind.
Take me to Antony.
Come with me, sir.
In Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all.
This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace.
He did this in public?
He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to Ptolemy.
Let’s send this news to Rome.
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already.
The people have heard it already, and they’ve been told of his accusations.
Who does he accuse?
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’ possessions, which we seized in Sicily.
Then he says I didn’t return some ships he loaned me.
Sir, these accusations should be answered.
It has been done already, and the messenger is on his way.
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position.
He’ll never agree to that.
Then we won’t agree to his demands.
Greetings, Caesar, my lord!
Greetings, dearest Caesar!
Oh, to think you’ve been rejected!
You’ve never thought of me like that, and you have no reason to.
Then why did you travel so quietly?
You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister.
Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her, with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears.
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven.
I would have met you by sea and again by land.
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him.
Which he quickly allowed, given that you’re an obstacle to his lust.
Amen.
Quiet!
Here comes Antony.
Have you seen my lord?
No, lady.
Wasn’t he here?
No, madam.
He was in a good mood, and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome.
Madam?
Here, at your service.
Here comes my lord.
Your wife, Fulvia, mustered her army first.
Against my brother Lucius?
Yes.
Don’t say that, my lord.
Where do you think he is now?
He’s in Athens, my lord.
No, he’s not.
Cleopatra summoned him.
He’s given his empire to a whore, and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war.
He’s recruited Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; the King of Pont; Herod, of Judea; Mithridates, King of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, the kings of Mede and Lycaonia, and many more.
I’m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other.
You’re welcome here.
I didn’t write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations.
Cheer yourself.
You will always be welcome to me. 
Welcome, lady.
Welcome, dear madam.
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you.
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you, giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us.
It’s undeniable.
You are welcome here, sister.
I beg you to continue to be patient.
My dearest sister!
But why, why, why?
You opposed my taking part in the war.
Isn’t this war against me?
Why shouldn’t I be there in person?
What do you mean?
Let Rome fall!
May the tongues of our critics rot!
I have responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man.
Don’t argue against it.
I won’t stay behind.
No, I’ve had my say.
Here comes the Emperor.
Isn’t it strange, Canidius, that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne?—Have you heard about this, sweet?
No one admires speed more than the lazy.
What else?
Why do you want to do that, my lord?
Because he’s daring us to do it.
So you’ve dared him to single combat.
Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where he fought against Pompey.
But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage, and so should you.
His ships are maneuverable.
Yours are slow and awkward.
Refusing to fight him at sea won’t disgrace you.
I’ll fight at sea.
Even if we fail at that, we can still fight him on land.
What’s your business?
The news is true, my lord.
He has captured Toryne.
Canidius, take our nineteen 
What’s the news, brave soldier?
Oh, don’t fight by sea, noble Emperor!
Don’t trust rotten planks.
Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds?
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming.
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe.
Well, well, let’s go.
By Hercules, I think I’m right.
Soldier, you are.
Our leader is being led.
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together, don’t you?
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land.
Caesar’s speed defies belief.
While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled.
Who’s his lieutenant, do you know?
A man named Taurus, they say.
I know the man well.
The Emperor is calling for Canidius.
The present time is like a woman in labor, each minute giving birth to some piece of news.
Taurus!
My lord?
Don’t attack by land.
Don’t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea.
Our fate depends on this chance.
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill, in sight of Caesar’s navy.
I can’t watch any more.
The Egyptian flagship, the  Gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them!
What’s wrong with you?
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness.
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces.
How goes the battle?
Right in the middle of the fight, just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral Egyptian nag—May she die of leprosy!—suddenly became frightened, and turned her ships around and fled.
I saw that.
The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more. 
Well, give me the worst news.
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it.
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward.
Go on.
As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done.
It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me.
Oh, my lord!
Speak plainly.
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her.
It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.
Good-bye for a while.
I never saw such a shameful act.
Terrible.
Terrible.
The battle on the sea is almost lost.
If our general had been his old self, we would have won.
Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own.
Are you considering desertion, as well?
Then everything must really be finished.
They fled toward Peloponnesus.
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar.
Listen.
Friends, come here.
I’m completely lost.
I have a ship full of treasure.
Escape and make peace with Caesar.
Flee?
Not us.
I’ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run.
Friends, go.
I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance.
Leave.
Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now!
Even my hair revolts.
Friends, go.
I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you.
Please, don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are.
Take your cues from my own despair.
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself.
Go to the harbor immediately!
I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure.
Just give me a moment, please—only a moment.
I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all before long.
What else?
Let me sit down.
Oh, damn, damn, damn!
Madam!
Madam, oh, good Empress!
The Queen is here, my lord.
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
He’s not himself because he feels so ashamed.
Well, then, help me.
Most noble sir, stand up.
The Queen is coming.
She’s weak and will die unless you comfort her.
I’ve destroyed my reputation, a most shameful error.
Sir, here’s the Queen.
Oh, where have you led me, Egypt?
Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic!
I didn’t think you would follow me.
Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you.
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’ orders in favor of yours.
Oh, forgive me!
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man.
You knew that my sword, weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what. 
Don’t shed even one tear.
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost.
Give me a kiss.
This repays me.
Let the envoy from Antony come in.
Do you know him?
Come forward and speak.
Humble as I am, I represent Antony.
Until recently, I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean.
So be it.
Say what you’re here for.
If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens.
That’s all he asks for himself.
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.
As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests.
I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him.
Then I’ll listen to her.
Give my answer to them both.
May good luck follow you!
Take him safely through the lines.
I go, Caesar.
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions.
I will, Caesar.
What are we going to do, Enobarbus?
Think about our situation, then die.
Who is to blame for this: Antony or I?
Only Antony was at fault.
Why should he have followed you?
With half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him.
To race after your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as great as the resulting loss.
Please, let’s not talk about it.
Is that his answer?
Yes, my lord.
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up?
That’s what he says.
Tell her. 
Your head, my lord?
A messenger has arrived from Caesar.
With no more ceremony than that?
See, ladies, how they scorn me now.
I’ll be at your service.
He’s waiting outside.
What’s your message?
Your wife, Fulvia, is dead.
Where did she die?
In Sicyon.
In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other, more serious matters that concern you.
Leave me.  
What does Caesar want?
It is for your ears only.
There are only friends here.
Speak confidently.
So they are possibly Antony’s friends.
Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has.
If Caesar chose, Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend.
As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.
Just remember that he is Caesar.
He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him, but because you feared him.
Oh!
He is like a god and knows the truth.
My honor wasn’t given; it was only dominated.
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him?
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you.
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you.
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection.
What’s your name?
My name is Thidias.
Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand.
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him.
Promising favors?
By Jove that thunders!
Who are you, slave?
You will be whipped.  
Take away this lout and whip him.
By the moon and stars!
Whip him!
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand—what’s her name now?
Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy!
Take him away.
Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us.
My good lord— You’ve always been a liar.
But when our vices become habits—Oh, the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our ruin. 
Oh, has it come to this?
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you.
No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip.
For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced it firsthand.
Why are you doing this?
Soundly, my lord.
Did he cry?
Did he beg my pardon?
He did ask for mercy.
Are you done yet?
You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells my ruin.
In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants?
Don’t you know me still?
Has your heart cooled toward me?
Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat.
As it dissolves, so shall my life.
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies.
I am satisfied.
I will fight him there.
Our land forces have bravely stood firm.
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself.
Where have you been, my bravery?
Do you hear what I say, lady?
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips, I’ll be covered in blood.
My sword and I will earn our place in history.
We still have hope. 
That’s my brave lord!
I’ll fight brutally.
But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me.
Come, let’s have one more extravagant night.
Invite all my sad captains.
Let’s drink through midnight.
It’s my birthday.
I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.
We’ll win yet.
Do so.
I’ll speak to them, and then tonight I’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds.
Now he’ll work himself up to a fury.
When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only weapon.
I’ll look for some way to leave his service.
He calls me “boy” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt.
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die, and in the meantime, we’ll laugh at his challenge.
Don’t give him time to catch his breath.
Anger does not protect the angry well.
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight.
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony’s former soldiers—enough to capture him.
See that it is done, and prepare a feast for the soldiers.
We have enough supplies for it, and they’ve earned it.
Poor Antony!
What would you like, sir?
I have to leave right away.
That will kill our lovers.
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them.
If we leave, it will feel like nothing less than death to them.
I must be gone.
If it’s that important, then let the women die.
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless.
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately.
I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason.
I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm.
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine.
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods.
He won’t fight with me, Domitius?
No.
Why won’t he?
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours, it would be like pitting twenty men against one.
Tomorrow, soldier, I’ll fight by sea and land.
By the end I will either live, or else I’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood.
Will you fight well?
When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” Well put.
Come on.
Call out my household servants.
Tonight let’s have plenty to eat.
You have all served me well, and kings are your peers.     
The gods forbid!
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants, obeying my commands.
Look—they’re crying.
Ha, ha, ha!
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that!
Those tears will bring blessings to you.
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends.
You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death.
Good night, brother.
Tomorrow is the day.
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city?
No.
What was it?
It was probably just a rumor.
Good night.
Well sir, good night.
Soldiers, watch carefully.
You too.
This is our station.
And if our navy wins tomorrow, no doubt our army will do their part.
It’s an outstanding army and highly motivated.
Quiet!
What’s that sound?
Listen!
There’s music coming out of thin air.
From under the earth.
It’s a lucky sign, isn’t it?
No.
Quiet, I say.
What does this mean?
Hello there, good sirs.
Yes.
Isn’t it strange?
Do you hear that, men?
Do you?
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops.
Good idea.
It’s very strange.
Get a little sleep.
Come on, good fellow, help me into that armor you’re carrying.
If luck deserts us today, it’s because we defy it.
Come on.
No, I’ll help too.
What’s this part for?
Ah, leave it alone.
You armor my heart.
No!
No!
Really, I’ll help.
It must go like this.
We’ve got it now.—Do you see this, my good fellow?
Go and put on your own armor.
In a minute, sir.
Didn’t I buckle this well?
Excellently, excellently.
Hurry.—Oh, love, if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft.
Good morning to you.
Welcome.
You look like a person who knows the business of war.
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully.
Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor.
The weather is fair.
Good morning, General.
Good morning, General.
That was a fine fanfare, boys.
Like a young man who wants to amount to something, this morning begins early.
Farewell, lady.
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss.
I’ll leave you without revealing any emotion, like a man of steel. 
Lead the way.
He goes forth to war bravely.
May the gods bless Antony today!
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land.
If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you.
Who deserted this morning?
You don’t know?
Someone who was always near you.
Sir, he’s with Caesar.
Sir, he left his belongings and treasure.
He’s gone?
It’s certain.
Eros, send his treasure to him.
Do it now.
Don’t keep anything back, I insist.
Write to him from me—I’ll sign it—sending greetings and gentle good-byes.
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master.
Oh, my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors.
Hurry.
Fulvia is dead.
Pardon me?
Fulvia is dead.
Fulvia?
Dead.
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks.
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve.
But in this way, grief and comfort appear together.
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose.
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started.
The business you began here needs you as well—especially the business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to.
Enough of this frivolous talk.
Give our officers notice of our intentions.
I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave.
Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return.
The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential.
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats.  
Agrippa, go start the battle.
We want Antony taken alive.
Make sure everyone knows that.
I will, Caesar.
An era of universal peace is about to start.
That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men.
Caesar hanged him for this service.
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust.
I’ve done a bad thing, for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy again.
Enobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous gifts besides.
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent.
It’s yours.
Don’t joke about this, Enobarbus.
I’m telling you the truth.
You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return.
I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post.
Your Emperor is still a king among gods.
I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best.
Oh, Antony, you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold!
My heart feels like it’s about to explode.
If grief doesn’t kill me, I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself—even though I think grief will do the job just as well.
I, fight against you, Antony?
No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in.
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life.
Retreat!
We’ve advanced too far.
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected.
Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight!
If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads.
You’re bleeding a lot.
I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.” They’re retreating.
We’ll chase ’em into their latrines.
I still have room for six more wounds.
They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory.
Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from behind.
It’s fair game to mark a coward.
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage.
Come on. 
I’ll limp after you.
We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp.
One of you run to the Queen with the news.
Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today.
You are all    Lord of lords!
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world? 
My songbird, we have beaten them to their beds.
What do you think, girl!
Look at this man.
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind.
He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy 
If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.
Oh, listen to me, night— Who is this?
Stay hidden and listen.
Be my witness, oh you blessed moon.
That’s Enobarbus?
Quiet!
Keep listening.
My heart, which dried out with grief, will surely break apart into a powder, and that will be the end of my disgusting mind.
Oh, Antony!
Let’s speak to him.
Let’s listen to him.
Good idea.
But he’s sleeping.
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep.
Let’s go to him.
Wake up, sir, wake up.
Speak to us.
Do you hear us, sir?
The hand of death has taken him.
Let’s carry him to the barracks.
He’s an important person.
Our hour is up.
Come on, then.
He may recover yet.
I will.
They’ve switched their operation to the sea today.
We didn’t please them on land.
We’re ready for both, my lord.
I wish they’d fight in fire or in the air.
But here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city.
Let’s take up the best positions we can in the valleys.
They still haven’t joined the battle.
I’ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there.
I’ll let you know right away how it’s going.
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails.
All is lost!
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me.
Three-time traitor and whore!
Tell the army to flee.
Order them to escape.
Go!
Oh, sun, I will never see another one of your sunrises.
Luck and Antony separate here and now.
Here we’ll shake hands good-bye.
Is it all come to this?
I’ve been stripped of everything, betrayed.
Oh, that devious Egyptian spirit!
Ah, you sorceress!
Be gone!
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
Get out of my sight, or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar’s victory.
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds!
Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender.
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails.
She’ll die for it.—Eros, ho!
Help me, ladies!
Go to your tomb!
Lock yourself in and send him word that you’re dead.
When a great person departs, it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body.
Say the last word I spoke was “Antony,” and please word it pathetically.
Go, Mardian, and let me know how he reacts to my death. 
Eros, can you still see me?
Yes, noble lord.
You’ve seen these illusions.
Yes, my lord.
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind, made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water.
That’s true, my lord.
Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud.
Here and now I seem like Antony, but I can’t keep myself in this form, my boy.
No, don’t cry, kind Eros.
Oh, your contemptible lady!
She has disarmed me.
Get out, insolent eunuch!
Silence!
She has betrayed me and shall die.
A person can only pay with their life once, and she has paid in full.
What you wanted is yours.
Most noble Antony!” Then, as she was speaking your name, a strangled groan split her words.
Antony” was divided between her heart and lips.
She gave up her life with your name still within her.
Is she dead, then?
Dead.
Remove your armor, Eros.
Off!
Take off my armor.
Oh, chest, obey me!
Heart, for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined.
Faster, Eros, faster.
I won’t be a soldier anymore.
Battered armor, be off.
You were worn with honor. 
I will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your forgiveness.
Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll stop here.
Now any effort ruins what it attempts.
Yes, even power gets in its own way.
End it, then, and everything is over.—Eros!—I’m coming, my Queen!—Eros!—Wait for me.
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor.
Eros!
What can I do for my lord?
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace.
Do it.
This is that time.
You won’t be striking me down, but defeating Caesar.
Call up your courage.
The gods forbid!
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows, though shot by enemies, could not?
Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame, while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the final stamp to his humiliation?
I would not.
Draw your trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your country.
Oh, sir, pardon me!
When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you?
Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me were accidental, without purpose.
Take out your sword and come on.
Then turn your noble face away from me, that face that the whole world adores.
Look!
Where is he?
I haven’t seen him recently.
What should I do that I’m not doing?
Always give him his way.
Never contradict him.
Don’t push him too far.
I wish you’d be patient.
We come to hate that which controls us.
But here comes Antony.
I am sick and sullen.
I’m sorry to have to say this— Help me away from here, dear Charmian!
I shall faint.
I have drawn my sword.
My dear master, my captain, my sovereign, let me say before I strike this fatal blow: farewell.
You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you.
Good-bye, great commander.
Should I do it now?
Now, Eros.
Well, then, there!
With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death.
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books.
I learned to do this from you. 
What!
I’m not dead?
Oh, kill me!
What’s the trouble?
I’ve botched the job, friends.
Oh, finish what I’ve begun.
Our guiding light is out.
And time itself is ended.
Sadness and despair!
Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead.
Not me.
Me neither.
None of us.
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape.
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor.
Where’s Antony?
There, Diomedes, there.
Is he still alive?
Why don’t you answer me, man?
Is that you, Diomedes?
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me.
Most powerful lord, my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you.
When did she send you?
Just now, my lord.
Where is she?
Locked in her tomb.
She had a premonition of what has actually happened.
Afraid that your anger would not subside, she sent you word she was dead.
Too late, good Diomedes.
Call my guard, please.
Hey out there!
Carry me, good friends, to where Cleopatra is.
It’s the last command I shall ever give you.
We’re very sorry, sir, that you may not live to wear us out with your commands.
It’s a very sad day.
No, my friends, don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well.
If we welcome our punishment, we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly.
Pick me up.
I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything.
Oh, Charmian, I will never leave this tomb!
Be calm, dear lady.
No, I won’t.
Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts.
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source.
What’s the news!
Is he dead?
He is close to death, but not dead yet.
Oh, Antony, Antony, Antony!
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Be calm!
It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself.
That’s the way it should be—only Antony should conquer Antony.
No, our general’s infatuation is out of control.
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops.
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore.
Look at them.
Take a good look, and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester.
Look and see.
If what you feel is really love, tell me how much.
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated.
I want to measure the extent of your love, to see how far it stretches.
Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth.
I have news from Rome, my good lord.
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
I just beg death to wait awhile, until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips.
I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear of capture.
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize.
If knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe from that fate.
Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me.
Help us, good friends.
Oh, quick, before I’m gone.
Such exercise!
My lord is so heavy!
If I had the goddess Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury, pick you up and seat you beside Jove.
And welcome, welcome!
Die where you have lived, in my arms.
If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this.
What a sad sight!
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Give me some wine and let me say a few words.
I’ll trust my determination and my hands, but none of Caesar’s men.
Now I feel my soul leaving.
I can’t speak any more. 
Most noble man, will you die?
Don’t you care about me?
Shall I stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without you?
My lord!
Oh, the glory of war has faded.
The flags have fallen.
Young boys and girls are equal to men.
There is nothing distinctive, nothing remarkable left in the world.
Our Queen is dead too.
Lady!
Madam!
Oh, madam, madam, madam!
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Quiet, quiet, Iras.
Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores.
Now all is for nothing.
How are you, my ladies?
Cheer up!
How are you, Charmian?
My gallant girls!
Good noble ladies, be brave.
We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us.
Come on, you can go.
The container of that great soul is now cold.
Ah, ladies, ladies!
Let’s go.
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death.
Tell him to surrender.
His position is hopeless.
Right away, Caesar.
What are you doing with a sword?
Who do you think you are coming in here armed?
My name is Decretus.
I served Mark Antony, who was the commander most worthy of my services.
While he was alive, I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies.
If not, you can kill me.
What are you saying?
Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead.
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap.
The fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens.
This isn’t the death of one man.
It’s the death of half the world. 
Now, my dearest Queen— Please, stand farther away from me.
What’s the matter?
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news.
What, does your wife say you can come home?
I wish she’d never let you come.
Don’t let her say I kept you.
I have no power over you.
You belong to her.
The gods know— Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been.
I knew from the first it would be this way.
Cleopatra— How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia?
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart.
When you begged to stay, that was the time for words.
You didn’t want to go then!
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows.
My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them.
This is his sword.
I pulled it from his wound.
Look—his noble blood is still on it.
Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news would make kings cry.
His faults were equally matched by his virtues.
But gods, you give us faults so we’ll be human.
Caesar is upset.
Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me.
Let me tell you, friends—
I’ll tell you at a better time.
This man looks like his business is urgent.
Let’s hear what he has to say.
Tell her to put her mind at rest.
She’ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her.
May the gods bless you.
Come here, Proculeius.
Tell her we mean her no disrespect.
Go, and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind. 
I will, Caesar.
Gallus, you go with him.
Where’s Dolabella?
Dolabella!
I remember he’s already occupied.
He’ll be done in time.
Come and see the proof.
It’s pathetic to be Caesar.
He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy.
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him.
What’s your name?
My name is Proculeius.
But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust.
If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom.
If he will grant me conquered Egypt, so that I may give it to my son, I will kneel to him with thanks.
Be content.
You’re in the charge of an honorable man.
Don’t be afraid.
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you.
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune.
I’m learning every hour how to be subservient.
I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady.
Be at ease.
Your majesty!
Oh, Cleopatra!
Stop, brave lady, stop!
We have not betrayed you.
What, am I being denied death, as well?
Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself.
Your death would prevent that.
Where are you, Death?
Come here.
Come, and you can have a queen.
Oh, control yourself, lady!
Let Caesar do whatever he wants.
You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia.
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome?
I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave.
I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting.
I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids!
You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so.
Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you.
I’ll take the Queen into my custody.
So be it, Dolabella.
Be kind to her.
Have you heard of me, most noble Empress?
I don’t remember.
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams.
Isn’t that your habit?
I don’t know what you mean, madam.
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony.
Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that!
When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled.
There was no end to his generosity.
Kings and noblemen served him.
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change.
Cleopatra— Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about?
No, gentle madam.
The gods can hear you lying!
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings.
Listen to me, madam.
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable.
I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now.
Thank you, sir.
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew.
You need not kneel to me.
Please rise, Queen.
The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir.
Don’t think I blame you.
I’ll leave you now.
You may do whatever you want in the world.
It’s yours, and you may hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like.
Here, my good lord.
What do you mean, lady?
I wish I were as big and strong as you.
Listen to me, Queen.
There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you.
My Italy is full of civil war.
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome.
But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.
Is it possible Fulvia is dead?
She’s dead, my Queen.
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra.
This is the inventory of the money, silverware, dishes, and jewels that are still in my possession.
Not even trivial things were left out.
Where’s Seleucus?
Here, madam.
This is my treasurer.
My lord, he will swear on his life that I haven’t kept a thing.—Tell the truth, Seleucus.
Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it.
What did I keep for myself?
Enough to buy everything you have declared.
No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra.
Look around you, Caesar.
Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over!
Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild.
I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you.
I’ll scratch out your eyes, even if they could fly.
Oh, that was unbelievably low!
Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed.
It’s all still yours.
Do whatever you like with it.
So cheer up.
No, dear Queen.
Eat and sleep.
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend.
And so, good-bye.
My master and my lord!
Not true.
Good-bye.
But listen, Charmian.
It’s time to end it, good lady.
I will, madam.
Where’s the Queen?
Look, sir.
Dolabella.
Make the best use of this information you can.
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise.
Dolabella, I will always be in debt to you.
And I your servant.
Good-bye, good Queen.
I must go attend Caesar.
Farewell, and thanks.
Now, Iras, what do you think?
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me, like Egyptian puppets.
Crude slaves with greasy aprons, rulers, and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see.
The gods forbid!
No, it’s certain, Iras.
Insolent  Oh, the good gods!
No, that’s the truth.
I’ll never see it.
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes; I’ll scratch them out.
Why, that’s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions.
Now, Charmian!
Women, dress me like a queen.
Go get my best clothes.
What’s that noise?
There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness.
He has brought you figs.
Let him come in.
What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed!
He brings me freedom.
There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me.
Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble.
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.
This is the man.
Leave us.
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain?
I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him.
People who die of it seldom or never recover.
Do you remember anyone who died of it?
Many people, men and women alike.
Indeed, she gives a very good testimony of the snake’s power.
But if you believe everything they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do.
But this is a sure thing: the snake’s an odd snake.
I hope you are pleased with the snake.
Farewell.
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature.
Yes, yes.
Farewell.
There isn’t any kindness in the snake.
Good.
Will it eat me?
Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself won’t eat a woman.
Well, you can go now.
Farewell.
Give me my robe.
Put on my crown.
I long to be immortal.
Quickly, quickly, good Iras, quickly.
I think I hear Antony call me.
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act.
I hear him mock Caesar’s luck, which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath.
Now let my courage prove my title as wife.
So, are you done?
Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips.
Good-bye, kind Charmian.
Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time.
Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips?
Did you fall?
If you can leave your body so easily, then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch, which hurts but is desired.
Do you lie still?
If you leave like that, you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good-bye. 
Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping!
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth.
Poor poisonous fool, be angry and bite.
Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!
Oh, eastern star!
Quiet, quiet!
Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep?
The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too.
Why should I stay— In this vile world?
So, good-bye.
Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession.
Close, soft eyes.
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again.
Your crown is crooked.
I’ll straighten it, then play— Where’s the Queen?
Speak softly.
Don’t wake her.
Caesar has sent— Too slow a messenger.
Oh, come quickly!
I almost feel you.
There’s Dolabella, who was sent from Caesar.
Call him.
What kind of work is this, Charmian?
Is this well done?
It is well done, and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!
What’s going on in here?
They’re all dead.
Caesar, you thought this would happen.
You’re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop.
Oh, unfaithful lover!
Stop arguing and listen to my plans.
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you.
I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant.
Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe.
Hurry!
Just as Antony loves.
Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is true.
That’s what Fulvia told me.
I beg you, turn away and cry for her.
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit.
Oh, sir, you are too good at predicting the future.
What you were afraid of has happened.
How did they die?
I don’t see any blood.
Who was with them last?
A simple country farmer who brought her figs.
This was the basket.
They were poisoned, then.
Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago.
She stood and spoke.
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress.
She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead.
Oh, noble weakness!
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark.
There’s a similar mark on her arm. 
This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them, just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile.
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb.
She shall be buried next to her Antony.
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous.
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome.
Come, Dolabella.
You’ll make me angry.
No more of this.
I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now.
I swear by my sword— Swear by your shield, too!
I’ll leave you, lady.
Polite sir, let me say one thing.
Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it.
It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but bear with me.
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them.
Your honor is the reason you are leaving.
May the gods be with you.
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed. 
Let’s go.
Come with me.
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even though I leave here, I stay with you.
You’re too forgiving.
Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself.
If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases, and that’s his business.
Here’s more news.
Pompey has a strong navy.
I should have known it.
It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized.
Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships.
They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them.
Antony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism.
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand.
You drank horses’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse.
It’s too bad.
Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly.
It’s time that we brought our armies into the field.
Pompey is making the most of our absence. 
Tomorrow, Caesar, I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war.
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, my lord.
Charmian!
Madam?
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone.
You think about him too much.
That’s treason!
I hope not, Madam.
What can I do for your highness?
I don’t want to hear you sing.
I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do.
It’s a good thing for you that, being castrated, you can better concentrate on my needs.
Do you have desires?
Yes, dear madam.
Indeed?
Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste.
Is he standing or sitting?
Or is he walking?
Or is he on his horse?
Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him.
He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me.
I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .
Are you thinking about me?
No, listen to it, Antony.
Perhaps  What, my love?
Maybe?
No, most likely.
You can’t stay here any longer.
Call in the messengers and we’ll find out.
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant.
Call the messengers!  
Queen of Egypt, greetings!
You are nothing like Mark Antony!
But since you come from him, you’re saturated with his healing spirit.
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony?
The last thing he did before sending me off, dear Queen, was to kiss—the last of many such kisses—this Indian pearl for you.
My ear must pull it out.
Good friend,” he said, “say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt, and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire.
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen.” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse, which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply.
Was he sad or happy?
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold: he was neither sad nor happy.
Just notice.
He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others.
He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . .
Oh, heavenly mixture!
Whether you are sad or merry, the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .
Yes, madam, twenty different messengers.
Why did you send so many?
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar.
Bring ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas.
Charmian, did I ever love Caesar as much as this?
Oh, that splendid Caesar!
May you choke on any other sentiments like that!
Say, “That splendid Antony.” The courageous Caesar!
By Isis, I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony, my best man among men. 
Pardon me, but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said.
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was.
In that case, the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good.
I’ll do well.
The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea.
My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together.
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war.
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money.
Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him, but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him.
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation.
They have a massive army.
Where did you hear this?
It’s not true.
From Silvius, sir.
He’s dreaming.
I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return.
Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips!
Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both.
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery.
This news is absolutely true: Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now.
In the time since he left Egypt, he could have traveled an even longer distance.
His military ability is double that of the other two.
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow. 
I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion.
Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones.
It will be as the gods see fit.
In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible.
Let’s go, Menas.
Good Enobarbus, you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly.
I will advise him to speak as he usually does.
By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today.
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances.
But major issues must come before minor ones.
Not if the minor ones come up first.
Here comes the noble Antony.
And there comes Caesar.    
You’re right.
If we were in front of our armies, about to fight, I would do this.
Welcome to Rome.
Thank you.
Have a seat.
After you.
No, after you.
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily—and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully, when I had no reason to speak of you at all. 
Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt.
But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt.
How do you mean, “conspired”?
You can judge for yourself what I mean.
Your wife and brother led troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name.
They said they were acting for you.
You’re mistaken.
My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion.
He rejected my authority as much as yours.
I’ve already sent the proof in my letters.
If you want to pick a fight, you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse.
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making up feeble excuses. 
Not true, not true.
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause.
As for my wife, if only you had such a wife.
It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that.
But you can’t blame me for her offenses.
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria.
I was not myself, as a result of the wine.
The next day I explained all this to him, which was as good as begging his pardon.
Let’s not fight over this fellow.
Meet with the ambassadors.
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people.
You will never be able to say the same about me.
Go on, Caesar.
What part of the agreement did I break?
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them.
You refused me both.
I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it.
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions.
Spoken like a gentleman.
If it’s okay with you, you should not press your grievances any further, but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you.
Well put, Maecenas.
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished.
You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do.
You are only a soldier.
Don’t speak any further.
As you please.
May I speak, Caesar.
What is it, Agrippa?
You have a beautiful half-sister, Octavia.
Great Mark Antony is a widower now.
You’d better not make that suggestion, Agrippa.
If Cleopatra heard you, you would be well punished for your audacity.
It’s true I’m not married, Caesar.
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say.
With this marriage, all the petty jealousies that now seem huge, and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves, would disappear.
Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that love.
What do you say, Caesar?
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia.
I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea.
Here’s my hand.
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister.
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts.
I’m happy to say “amen” to that!
I didn’t think I would ever fight Pompey.
There isn’t much time.
Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come after us. 
Where is he now?
Near  How large is his land army?
Large and increasing.
But his navy rules the sea.
That’s what I hear.
Come with us, Lepidus.
Noble Antony, even illness couldn’t keep me away.
Good Enobarbus!
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably.
And I see you survived your time in Egypt.
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast—for only twelve people!
Is that true?
That was nothing.
There were many even more memorable feasts.
She’s a remarkable lady, if the rumors are to be believed.
I’ll tell you.
The sails were dyed purple, and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love.
The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music.
Pretty, Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her, smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans, which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them, undoing what they did.
How excellent for Antony!
When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper.
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead.
Royal seductress!
Now Antony has to leave her completely.
Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring.
Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut.
Let’s go.
Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here.
I humbly thank you.
And I will spend our time apart on my knees, praying for you.
Good night.
Tell me why, if you can.
But you had better get back to Egypt again.
Tell me who shall have the better luck, Caesar or me?
Caesar.
So you’d better not stay with him, Antony.
Your guardian angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s not around.
But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened.
That’s why there must be space between you. 
Have a good night!
Don’t speak of this again.
To none but you, only to you.
With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds.
Your light dulls when he is near.
Leave now.
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him.
Come here, Ventidius.
You must go to Parthia.
Your authorization is ready.
Come with me and I’ll get it for you.
Don’t spend any more time here.
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations.
Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye.
Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear, which will suit you both very well.
You’re taking a shorter route.
My plans take me a roundabout way.
You’ll get there two days before me.
Good luck, sir.
Farewell.
Play me some music.
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers.
Musicians, come in!
Never mind.
Let’s play billiards.
Play with me, Charmian.
My arm is sore.
I’ll do my best, madam.
I don’t want to play now.
Give me my fishing rod.
We’ll go to the river.
With my music playing in the background, I’ll lure fish.
Cram your good news into my ears.
Madam, madam— Antony’s dead!
If you say that, you bastard, you’ll kill your Queen.
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand.
Let me say first, madam, that he is well.
Well then, here’s more money for you.
But you know, sirrah, we customarily say that the dead are well.
If that’s what you mean, I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words.
Good madam, let me speak.
All right, I will.
But you don’t look as if you bring good news.
If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here.
I am the duke who loved your father.
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story.—Good old man, you are as welcome here as your master is.
Give him your arm.
Give me your hand, and explain your situation to me.
You haven’t seen him since?
Sir, sir, that can’t be true.
If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place.
But do this: find your brother, wherever he is.
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land.
I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt.
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother.
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands.
Do this immediately, and send him packing.
Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love.
And you,  And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless.
In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible.
Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring.
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?
You’re a natural-born philosopher!
Were you ever at court, shepherd?
Honestly, no.
Then you are damned.
I hope not.
Explain.
Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation.
You are in a perilous state, shepherd.
Not at all, Touchstone.
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court.
You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands.
Now, if courtiers were shepherds, that kind of courtesy would be unclean.
Give a quick example.
Come, explain.
Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy.
What, don’t courtiers' hands sweat?
And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat?
That’s a poor example.
A better example—come on.
Besides, our hands are hard and calloused.
Then your lips will feel them more quickly.
Come on.
You worthless man!
You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak.
Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar.
Fix your example, shepherd.
Your wit is too courtly for me.
I’ll rest now.
Good morning, sir.
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?
Where will the old duke live?
You’re going to rest while you’re still damned?
God help you, foolish man.
Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed.
That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation.
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.
There is no jewel like Rosalind.
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world, carrying the name of Rosalind.
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind.
Don’t think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind.
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours.
That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market.
Oh, stop, fool.
Let me try: If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do.
A cat in heat will look for a mate, And Rosalind certainly will too.
Winter garments need to be filled with something, And so does skinny Rosalind.
After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart.
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut.
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it, and by Rosalind.
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along.
Why bother with them?
Quiet, you stupid fool.
I found them on a tree.
Well, the tree bears rotten fruit.
All right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely.
Quiet!
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence  I’ll write “Rosalinda,” Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman.
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain.
Nature took Helen’s  Cleopatra’s majesty, The best of Atalanta, And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty.
So, by heaven’s decree, Rosalind Was composed Of different faces, eyes, and hearts, so that she might have the most prized touches of all.
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave.
Were you listening to these verses?
Oh yes, I heard them all, and more, too.
Some of those lines had more feet than the  That’s not a problem: the feet can bear Sure, but these feet were 
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees?
Was it a man?
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck.
Are you blushing?
Please, who?
It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes.
No, who are you talking about?
Is it possible?
No, I’m begging you now, tell me who it is.
Oh, this is wonderful, wonderful—just wonderful wonderful!
Good grief, do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man, I have a man’s patience?
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas.
I’m begging you, tell me who it is quickly, and speak fast.
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle: either too much at once or none at all.
I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news.
So you want to put a man in your belly.
Did God make him?
I mean, what sort of man is he?
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
No, he has only a little beard.
Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him.
I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on.
It’s Orlando, who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant.
Damn you for mocking me.
Really, cousin, it’s him.
Orlando?
Orlando.
What did he do when you saw him?
What did he say?
How did he look?
Where did he go?
What brings him here?
Did he ask about me?
Where is he staying?
How did he say good-bye?
And when will you see him again?
Answer me in a word.
You’d better get me  But does he know that I’m here in the forest and dressed in men’s clothing?
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling?
But taste my story, and relish it by paying attention.
I found Orlando under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
That tree could be called God’s tree, since it drops such wonderful fruit.
Let me talk, good lady.
Go on.
He lay there, stretched out like a wounded knight.
Though that must have been a pitiful sight, the ground looked beautiful.
Cry, “whoa!” to your tongue, please.
It’s leaping about like a frisky horse.
He was dressed like a hunter.
Oh, that’s ominous!
He has come to kill my heart.
I’d like to sing my song solo.
You’re making me go off-key.
Don’t you know that I’m a woman?
Whatever I think, I have to say.
Sweetheart, go on.
Quiet!
Isn’t that him heading this way?
That’s him.
Thanks for your company but, really, I would have preferred being alone.
Me too, but still, for the sake of good manners, I’ll say thanks for your company.
Goodbye.
Let’s meet as little as we can.
I also hope that we can be better strangers.
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks.
Please don’t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly.
Your love’s name is Rosalind?
Yes, that’s it.
I don’t like her name.
How tall is she?
Just as tall as my heart.
You’re sure full of smooth answers.
Your worst fault is being in love.
Well, it’s a fault I wouldn’t trade for your best virtue.
I’m tired of you.
There I’ll see only myself.
Which is either a fool or a nothing.
I’m not going to waste any more time with you.
Goodbye, good Mr. Love.
I’m glad to see you go.
Adieu, good Mr. Depression.
Very well.
What do you want?
You should ask me what time of day it is, instead.
There’s no clock here in the forest.
Then there must be no lovers in the forest, either, because they’re as good as a clock, marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour.
Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem.
I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise.
Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed.
Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me.
I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you.
I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined.
I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother.
So use your discretion.
I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger.
But if I really laid him bare, I’d have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking.
Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”?
Wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate?
No, not at all, sir.
Time travels at different speeds for different people.
I can tell you who time strolls for, who it trots for, who it gallops for, and who it stops cold for.
Okay, who does it trot for?
Who does time amble for?
Time ambles for both men.
Who does it gallop for?
Who does it stand still for?
For lawyers on vacation, because they sleep their holidays away, with no sense of how time moves.
Where do you live, pretty young man?
Were you born here?
Just like the rabbit, who lives where she is born.
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this.
Many people have told me so.
Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city.
Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex.
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of?
There were no primary ones.
Please, tell me some of them.
No, I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick.
There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks.
Well, I’m the man you’re speaking of.
Please, tell me your cure.
But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about.
He taught me how to recognize a man in love, and you’re not a prisoner of love, I’m sure.
What did he say the symptoms were?
A thin face, which you don’t have; a sleepless, sunken eye, which you don’t have; an irritable temper, which you don’t have; a neglected beard, which you don’t have—but that might not be so telling, since you don’t have much beard anyway.
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles, your hat flying off your head, your sleeves unbuttoned, your shoes untied, and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery.
But you’re no such man.
You’re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else.
Young boy, I wish I could make you believe that I’m in love.
Make me believe it?
But really, are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind?
I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man.
Are you really as in love as your poems declare?
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her.
The only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it, too.
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance.
Have you ever cured anyone this way before?
Yes, one, and this is how I did it.
I don’t want to be cured, boy.
I could cure you, if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me.
By my faith in love, I will, then.
Tell me where you live.
Come with me, I’ll show you, and along the way, you can tell me where you live.
Will you come?
Wholeheartedly, good young man.
No, you have to call me Rosalind.—Sister, you’re coming?
Come on, sweet Audrey.
I’ll get your goats, Audrey.
Do my simple features please you?
Your features, God help us!
What features?
Really, Audrey, I wish you were more poetical.
I don’t know what “poetical” means.
Is it “chaste in word and action”?
Does it mean being truthful?
Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial.
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical?
I do, in fact.
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin; if you were a poet, I might have some hope you were lying.
What, you don’t want me to be chaste?
Not really, unless you were ugly.
Well, I’m not beautiful, so I hope that I can at least be chaste.
I’m not a slut—I keep myself clean—but I thank God I am ugly.
Well, praise the Lord you’re ugly.
Well, God bless this marriage!
Amen.
Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage.
Horns?
Well, there they are.
Only for poor men?
No, no.
The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s.
Is the single man lucky, then?
No.
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead.
Here comes Sir Oliver.
Will you marry us here, under this tree, or should we follow you to your chapel?
Is there anyone to give the bride away?
I don’t want to take another man’s second-hand goods.
No, someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal.
How are you, sir?
We’re glad to see you.
God bless you for being here.
I’m very glad to see you.
This is just a trifling matter here, sir.
No, no, put your hat back on.
Do you want to get married, fool?
Just as the ox has his yoke, the horse its bridle, the falcon a tether, a man has his desires—to keep in check.
And, being a man of your breeding, you’re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar?
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest, who can tell you what marriage is all about, marry you.
Then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage.
Come with me and let me advise you.
Come, sweet Audrey.
We have to be married properly.
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession.
Don’t talk to me.
I’m going to cry.
Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man.
But don’t I have good reason to cry?
As good a reason as any.
So go ahead and cry.
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest.
I’m very glad I came to see you.
If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him.
If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again.
Farewell, my lord.
But not for long; Charles will take care of everything.
But you heard him swear up and down that he was.
He’s staying in the forest with your father now.
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him.
He laughed at that and let me go.
He writes brave poems, speaks brave words, makes brave promises, and then breaks them just as bravely.
He’s like a cowardly 
Who’s coming here?
Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with.
Yes, what about him?
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
Do not, Phoebe.
Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly.
Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers.
Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused.
But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark.
Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person.
Oh, darling Phoebe, if you ever fall in love with some fresh face, then you’ll know about the invisible wounds that love’s sharp arrows can make.
Well, until that time, don’t come near me.
And when that time comes, then you can mock me, but please don’t pity me, because I won’t pity you.  
But mistress, know yourself.
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man.
Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer.
So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.
Besides, I don’t like you.
Come on, sister.
And don’t be proud.
The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful.
Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me.
Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius.
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured.
You have my friendship.
Isn’t that enough?
I want you.
Well, that’s just greedy.
But don’t expect any more than that.
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me?
Not very well, but I’ve met him several times.
Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him.
But what do I care about words?
And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to.
He’s awfully proud, but his pride suits him.
He’ll grow up to be a proper man.
He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age.
His legs aren’t great, but they’re alright.
His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink.
What right did he have to scold me like that?
He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me.
I’m surprised I didn’t bite back.
But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough.
I’ll write him a taunting letter, and you can deliver it.
Will you do that for me, Silvius?
With all my heart, Phoebe.
I’ll be bitter toward him, and curt.
Come with me, Silvius.
Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better.
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
I am.
I like it better than laughing.
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful.
Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet.
In that case it’s good to be a post.
I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer.
You’re a traveler.
Well then, you have good reason to be sad.
I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s.
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
Not true.
And your experience makes you sad.
I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad—and to travel for all that trouble, no less!
Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind.
My beautiful Rosalind, I’m only an hour late.
Please, Rosalind, my sweet cousin—be happy.
Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier?
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father, you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy.
Well, by this I can see that you don’t love me as much as I love you.
If  Well, I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation, in order to focus on the happiness of yours.
I swear I will, and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster.
So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy.
From now on I will, cousin, and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us.
Let me see—what do you think about falling in love?
You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour?
Forgive me, darling Rosalind.
No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you.
I’d rather be wooed by a snail.
A snail?
Besides, he brings his fate with him.
What fate is that?
Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives.
See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity.
A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous.
And I am your Rosalind.  
Come on, woo me, woo me.
I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want.
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind?
I’d kiss you before I spoke.
No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say.
When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss.
What if she won’t kiss me?
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves?
Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit.
Aren’t I your Rosalind?
I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her.
No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy.
This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love.
Then love me, Rosalind.
Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest.
And will you have me?
Sure, and twenty others just like you.
What’s that?
Well, aren’t you a good man?
I hope so.
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing?—Come on, sister, you can be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
Please, marry us.
I do.
Okay, but when?
Right now; as fast as she can say the vows.
Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.” I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband.
So do all thoughts.
They have wings.
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her.
Forever and a day.
No, Orlando, men are like April when they’re wooing a girl—young, and passionate—but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled.
I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey.
I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood.
And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena.
But will my Rosalind do this, too?
But she is wise.
Right.
The wiser the woman, the wilder.
If you close the doors on a woman’s wit, it’ll fly out the window.
If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole.
If you stop up the keyhole, it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke.
A man with a wife like that might ask, “Hey, wandering wit, where are you off to?” Nah, better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed.
You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue.
A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman.
Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours.
I must join the duke for lunch.
I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock.
Oh, go, leave me.
I knew you’d turn out this way.
My friends told me as much, and I knew it, too.
So, take me, death!
You’ll be back at two o'clock?
Yes, sweet Rosalind.
So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise.
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind.
So, goodbye.
Well, time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal.
Goodbye.
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours.
We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly.
Oh cousin, cousin, cousin, my sweet little cousin, I wish you knew how deep in love I am.
Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other.
Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs.
I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando.
I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns.
And I’m going to sleep.
Which one of you killed the deer?
Yes, sir.
Then sing it.
It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough.                      
What do you say now?
Isn’t it past two o'clock?
And I see a lot of Orlando here.
Look who’s coming.
No, I swear, I don’t even know what’s in it.
Phoebe wrote it.
Well, then, what should we do for fun instead?
Let’s go find that hussy, Fortune, and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally.
Oh, really?
Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all?
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument, hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us?
Come on, you’re a fool, and driven to extreme measures by love.
The point is that she didn’t write this letter.
These are a man’s words, and his handwriting.
I’m telling you, it’s hers.
Why, she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian.
No, a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings.
Do you want to hear what she says?
If you want to read it, as I haven’t heard it yet, though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.
She’s Phoebe-ing me.
Listen to what the tyrant says.
You call that ranting?  
You call this sneering?
Why do you pity him?
Follow them straight to the cottage.
Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are.
Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you?
It is.
It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained.
Please, tell us.
He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back.
He discovered that the man was his older brother.
Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive.
He turned away twice and almost left him there.
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge, his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved.
Are you his brother?
Was it you that he rescued?
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him?
That was me, but it’s not me— I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was, since I’m so happy to have since converted.
But what about the bloody handkerchief?
I’ll get there.
After a brief time—as he is a strong, brave man—
Many people faint when they see blood.
There’s more to it than that.—Ganymede!
Look, he’s recovering.
I want to go home.
We’ll take you there.
Please, will you take his arm?
Buck up, boy!
You’re a man?
You don’t have a man’s courage.
It’s true, I confess.
Oh, sir, someone would think I was a good fake.
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on.
Whoo-hoo!
That was no show.
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint.
Fake, I’m telling you.
Well, then, be brave and pretend to be a man.
That’s what I’m doing.
But honestly, I should have been a woman.
Come on, you keep getting paler.
I’ll do that, because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him, Rosalind.
I’ll think of something.
But please, tell him how well I faked a faint.
Will you come with us?
We’ll get married at some point, Audrey.
Be patient.
Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said.
No, he was wicked and vile.
But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl.
Here comes the man himself.
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin.
How old are you, friend?
Twenty-five, sir.
A mature age.
Is your name William?
Yes, it’s William, sir.
A good name.
Were you born here in the forest?
Yes sir, thank God.
Thank God”—that’s a good answer.
Are you rich?
Well, so-so.
So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer.
And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so.
Are you wise?
Yes sir, I’m fairly witty.
Well, that’s a fine answer.
Give me your hand.
Are you educated?
No, sir.
Then learn this from me: if you have something, you have it.
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass, the cup becomes empty.
Why, the he that will marry this woman.
Or, rather, I’ll kill you, or I’ll do away with you, or I’ll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity.
I’ll poison you, or beat you with a club, or stab you with a sword.
I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness.
I will, in other words, kill you in three hundred and fifty ways.
Therefore, tremble with fear and leave.
Do what he says, William.
Farewell, sir.
Our master and mistress are looking for you.
Let’s go.
Hurry up, Audrey, hurry.—I’m coming, I’m coming.
Mistress, you have to go see your father.
Did they make you the messenger?
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good, and that the mustard on top of them—he swore on his honor—was bad.
Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying.
And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that?
Yes, please; unleash your wisdom.
Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.
And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave.
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her?
It will be to your advantage, because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest.
You have my consent.
You can be married tomorrow if you want.
I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers.
Go get Aliena ready—because, look, here comes my Rosalind.
And hello to you, fair sister.
Oh, darling Orlando, it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling.
Actually, it’s my arm.
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws.
They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together.
You couldn’t beat the two of them apart.
They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony.
But, oh, it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes.
Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for.
Well then, can’t I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow?
I can’t live by pretending anymore.
I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat.
You should know that I think you’re a smart man.
Believe me, then, that I have special powers.
Since I was three years old, I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician—no black magic here.
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do, you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena.
I know where she is and, if you don’t mind, I will set her before you tomorrow, whole and unharmed.
Are you serious?
I swear on my life, which I take pretty seriously, even if I am a magician.
Look, here comes someone who loves me, along with someone who loves her.
I don’t care.
A faithful shepherd worships you.
Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love.
It means being full of sighs and tears, like I am for Phoebe.
And like I am for Ganymede.
And like I am for Rosalind.
And like I am for no woman.
It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe.
And like I am for Ganymede.
And like I am for Rosalind.
And like I am for no woman.
It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion.
And I for Rosalind.
And I for no woman.
Since you know all this is true, why do you blame me for loving you?
And why do you blame me for loving you?
And why do you blame me for loving you?
Who are you talking to?
I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me.
All right, stop this.
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon.
As long as I’m alive, I’ll be here.
Me too.
Me too.
Tomorrow is the happy day, Audrey.
We’ll be married tomorrow.
I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman.
Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages.
Good afternoon, good gentleman.
It really is good to see you.
Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song.
Sounds good to us.
Sit between us.
Should we just get down to it?
Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse.                
Really, young men, though it wasn’t a very hard song to get right, the music was still all out of tune.
Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised?
Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her.
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms.
Yes, even if I die an hour later.
But if you decide not to marry me, you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead?
That’s the deal.
Even if marrying her meant I died.
I’ve promised to make everything right.
Phoebe, keep your promise to marry me, and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me.
Silvius, keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me.
I’ll leave now, to set all these things right.
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter.
My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother.
But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic.
My lord, welcome this man.
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest.
He swears he used to be a courtier.
If anyone doubts this, let him put me on trial.
I have bankrupted three tailors.
I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight.
And how was that one settled?
Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause.
What do you mean, the seventh cause?
I like him very well.
Tell me, who is this knight?
A man old Frederick, your father, loves.
If he has my father’s love, then that’s enough honor for me.
Enough of this.
No more talk about my father; you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days.
It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do.
Honestly, you’re speaking the truth—ever since the fools were  With his mouth full of news.
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young.
Then we’ll be stuffed with news.
Well that’s good.
If we’re  Hello, Monsieur Le Beau.
What’s the news?
Fair princess, you’ve missed some good sport.
Sport?
Of what 
God bless you, sir.
This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine.
Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings.
But back to that argument you mentioned.
What’s the “seventh cause”?
I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard.
He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine.
They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.” And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well?
He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester.
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit.
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite.
Good duke, come receive your daughter.
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here.
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter.
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind.
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love.
Quiet!
My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter.
Let me have your attention for a moment.
I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news.
When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother.
I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth.
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk?
Yes, he has.
I will go find him.
There is much to be learned from these converts. 
Stay, Jaques, stay here for a bit.
No, this fun is not for me.
I’ll wait for you in your cave, where you can tell me what you need from me.
Let’s proceed.
We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight.
If it’s true that you don’t need 
What color, madam?
I don’t understand—how should I answer that?
However your wit and luck allow.
Tell us about this wrestling.
Well, we’ve missed the beginning; it’s dead and buried.
There comes an old man with his three sons— It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale.
Three proper young men, all good looking and with great presence—
Right, and they wore proclamations around their necks, saying, “Be it known to all men by these  The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler.
Charles did the same to the second brother, and the third.
They’re lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving.
Oh, dear!
But tell me, monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing?
Why, the one I just told you about.
Me too, I swear.
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this, and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs?
Shall we go watch this wrestling, cousin?
Yes, I see them coming.
Let’s stay and watch.
Come on.
Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness.
Is that the man?
That’s him, madam.
Alas, he is too young.
Yet he seems capable.
What’s up, daughter and niece?
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling?
Yes, my lord, if you give us permission.
You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man.
Because he’s so young, I’ve tried to discourage him, but he won’t listen.
Call him over here, good Monsieur Le Beau.
I remember, Adam, that’s  Here comes my master, your brother.
Go hide, Adam, and you’ll hear how he abuses me.
Mister Challenger, the princess wants to speak to you.
I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty.
Young man, have you challenged Charles the Wrestler?
No, lovely princess.
He is the general challenger.
I have only come in—like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth.
Young gentleman, you are too bold for your age.
You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength.
If you took a good look at yourself, or if you thought about this more carefully, your fear would teach you to act more cautiously.
We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up.
Please, young sir.
If I’m killed, it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead.
I won’t wrong any of my friends, because I don’t have any to mourn for me, and I won’t have wronged the world, because I don’t have anything in the world.
In this world, I’m only taking up space.
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have.
Mine too, to join hers.
Good luck.
I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances.
I hope you get what you desire!
You get only one round.
No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first.
You should mock me    I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg.
Oh, what an excellent young man!
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes, I can tell you who’d be on the ground.
No more, no more.
How are you doing, Charles?
He can’t speak, my lord.
Carry him away.
What is your name, young man?
Orlando, my lord, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
I wish you were someone else’s son.
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man, but he was always my enemy.
I wish you had told me you had a different father.
If I were my father, cousin, would I do this?
I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son—his youngest son—and I would never change that, not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir.
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul, and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion.
If I had known this young man was his son, I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight.
Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him and encourage him.
Yes.
Good luck, fair gentleman.
He’s calling us back.
My  Will you come on, cousin?
I’m coming.
Farewell.
What is this passion that ties up my tongue?
I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to.
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you.
Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place.
Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done.
The duke is temperamental.
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake.
Goodbye, sir.
Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you.
I’m indebted to you.
Goodbye.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother!
But, oh, heavenly Rosalind!
What’s going on, Rosalind?
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog.
No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs.
Throw some of your words at me.
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any.
Is all of this about your father?
No, some of it is about my child’s father.
If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats.
Cough them up.
I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
Come on, take control of your feelings.
But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself.
Oh, that’s a good wish!
You’ll fight with him eventually, and  The duke, my father, loved his father very much.
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son?
By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father.
But I don’t hate Orlando.
No, please don’t hate him—for my sake.
Why shouldn’t I?
Doesn’t he deserve it?
Let me love him because he deserves it, and you can love him because I do.
Look, here comes the duke.
He looks angry.
Madam, hurry as fast as you can get out of my court.
Me, uncle?
You, niece.
In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it.
Please, your Grace, tell me what crime I have committed.
If I know my own thoughts and desires, and I’m not dreaming or crazy—which I’m sure I’m not—then, dear uncle, I’ve never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you.
All traitors protest like this.
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself.
I don’t trust you.
You are your father’s daughter.
That’s enough.
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom.
I was his daughter when you banished him.
My father wasn’t a traitor.
So, please, my lord, don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor, with no titles to my name.
Dear master, listen to me.
Yes, Celia, we kept her here for your sake.
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value, but now I know her.
If she’s a traitor, why then, so am I.
You’re a fool.
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture.
So be quiet.
The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable.
She is banished.
Then lay that sentence on me too, my lord.
I cannot live without her.
You are a fool.—You, niece, prepare to leave.
On my honor and by my word, if you outstay the ten days, you will die.
Oh, my poor Rosalind, where will you go?
Do you want to exchange fathers?
I’ll give you mine.
I insist, don’t be more distressed than I am.
I have more reason to be distressed.
Hey, you!
What are you  Nothing.
I’ve never been taught how to make anything.
Well, then, what are you messing up?
I’m helping  Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while.
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them?
When did I  Do you know where you are, sir?
Yes, sir, very well—I’m here in your orchard.
Do you know whom you’re talking to?
Yes, better than you know me.
I know you’re my oldest brother, and deserve more respect.
I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older.
No you haven’t, cousin.
Please, be cheerful.
Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter?
No, he hasn’t.
Oh, he hasn’t?
Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one.
Will we be separated?
Should we part, sweet girl?
I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say.
But where will we go?
To the Forest of Arden, to find your father.
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far!
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money.
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt.
Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man?
I’ll wear a big sword in my belt, carry a boar-spear in my hand, and hide all my womanish fear in my heart.
What should I call you when you’re a man?
I’ll take no lesser name than that of  Something that refers to my current state.
Instead of Celia, call me Aliena.
Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels?
Let’s go gather our jewels and money.
We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards, whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone.
Now, we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment.
Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance?
Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues?
I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous  I wouldn’t change my situation for anything.
You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you.
Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner?
It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted city’s native citizens, should be gouged with arrows.
Indeed, my lord, the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths.
Big, round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose.
And did you leave him like this?
We did, my lord, weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer.
Take me to him.
I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits, because then he always has a lot to say.
I’ll bring you to him right away.
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave?
It cannot be.
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen.
I can’t find anyone who saw her leave.
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed, and early this morning the bed was empty.
My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing.
Send a message to his brother.
Bring that swinger Orlando here.
If he’s not around, bring his brother Oliver to me.
I’ll make Oliver find him.
Do this immediately, and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways.
Who’s there?
What are you doing here?
Why are you so strong and good?
Why do people love you?
And why are you noble, strong, and brave?
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion?
Your praise has beaten you home.
Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in?
Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him!
Why, what’s the matter?
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you.
Oliver, your brother—no, not your brother; and yet he’s the son—but no, I won’t call him the son—of that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down, with you in it.
And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you.
I overheard him and his plans.
This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse.
Hate it, fear it, do not come inside.
Then where would you have me go, Adam?
It doesn’t matter where, so long as it’s not here.
What, would you have me beg for my food?
This is all that’s left for me to do, but I won’t do it.
I’d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers.
But don’t do that.
Let me be your servant.
I know I may be old, but I’m strong and healthy, because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly.
Therefore, my old age is like a blustery winter: cold, but kindly.
Let me go with you.
I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you.
Oh, good old man, you’re a great example of that old work ethic, where people worked because it was their duty, not just for the money.
Come along, though.
We’ll go together, and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth, we’ll find a way to make a living.
Go on, master, and I will follow you—with truth and loyalty to my last breath.
From the time I was seventeen, over sixty years ago, I have lived in this house, but now I will live here no more.
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen; at eighty, it’s a bit late.
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well, without owing my master anything.
Oh Lord, my spirits are tired!
I wouldn’t care about my spirits, if my legs weren’t tired.
I can’t go any further.
I’d rather bear with you than  Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
Yes, now I’m in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool.
Yes, be content, good Touchstone.
Look who’s coming: a young man and an old man, having a serious talk.
What, you dare put your hands on me, villain?
I’m no villain.
If you weren’t my brother, I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this.
You’ve only insulted yourself.
Gentlemen, calm down.
For the sake of your father’s memory, make peace.
Let me go, I say.
I won’t until I’m ready.
You will listen to me.
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education.
But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman.
My father’s spirit is growing in me, and I won’t take this any longer.
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money?
Well, sir, go inside.
I’m not going to be bothered by you for long.
You’ll get some of what you want.
Now please leave me alone.
What you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually.
Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her!
I’m sure I can guess.
No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long.
If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to?
Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten.
Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me.
If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved.
Or if you haven’t sat as I do now, boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues, then you haven’t loved.
Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved.
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Oh, poor shepherd!
Me too.
I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile.
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked.
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things.
But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love.
You speak more wisely than you know.
Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it.
By God!
And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it.
Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him.
Shut up, fool.
He’s not your relative.
Who’s calling?
Your superiors.
Please sir, if love or money can buy anything in this empty place, tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves.
Dear sir, I pity the lady and wish—more for her sake than my own—that I was more able to help her.
But I’m a hired hand: I don’t profit from the flocks I tend.
Besides, his cottage, his flocks, and his grazing rights are on sale now, and since he’s not there, there’s nothing to eat at our house.
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture?
That young man who was just here.
Please, if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man, buy the cottage, pasture, and flock for us, and we’ll pay you for it.
And we will raise your wages.
The thing is definitely going to be sold.
Come with me.
If you like what you see of the land, the profit that’s possible, and this rustic life, I’ll be your faithful servant, and buy the place with your gold right away.
More, more, please, more.
It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques.
I’m glad about that.
More, please, more.
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs.
More, please, more.
My voice is ragged.
I know I won’t please you.
Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”?
Nah, I don’t care what their 
Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now.
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together.
The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know.
And I’ve been avoiding him all day.
He’s too argumentative for me.
I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it.
Come, warble for me.
I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative.
Dear master, I can’t go any farther.
Oh, I’m dying of hunger.
I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave.
Farewell, kind master.
Hey, what’s this, Adam?
No braver than this?
Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little.
If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you.
You’re not as close to death as you think you are.
I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die.
But if you die before I return, you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts.
There we go!
You look happier already, and I’ll be back quickly.
But you’re lying out in the cold.
Cheer up, good Adam.
I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man.
My lord, he just left here.
He was happy here, listening to a song.
If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe.
Go find him.
Tell him I want to speak with him.
He saved me the trouble: here he comes.
Well, what’s going on, mister?
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company?
What, you look amused.
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o'clock.
This way, we can see how the world moves.
Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven.
Oh, noble fool!
A worthy fool!
Motley is the only thing to wear.
Who is this fool?
A worthy fool!
God bless my old master.
He would never have spoken to me like this.
Is that how it’s going to be?
Are you starting to challenge me?
I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis!
Did you call for me, your Worship?
Wasn’t Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you.
Call him in.
I have a good plan.
Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do.
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest.
Why, sir, must he?
Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church.
Dress me up in motley.
Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine.
To hell with you!
I know what you’d do.
What would I do besides good?
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large.
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her?
And when some lowlife protests that  Stop, and eat no more.
But I haven’t eaten anything yet.
And you won’t until the needy eat.
What kind of fighting cock is this?
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners?
You were right the first time.
But stop, I say.
If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die.
What would you like?
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does.
I’m dying for food, so let me have some.
Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table.
Do you really speak like such a gentleman?
I beg your pardon.
I thought everything out here was wild, which is why I acted so stern and commanding.
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity—therefore, sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs.
Then please, put off your eating for a little while I, like a mother doe, find my fawn and bring it food.
There is a poor old man who, purely out of love, has limped after me for miles.
Thank you, and God bless you for your hospitality.
You see, we’re not alone in our unhappiness.
The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors.
They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts.
In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms.
Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school.
He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part.
Welcome.
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat.
I thank you very much on his behalf.
Welcome.
Eat.
I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation.—Some music, please, and, good friend, sing.
Of course.
You sell fish.
No, not me, sir.
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller.
Good, sir?
Yes, sir.
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world.
That’s definitely true, my lord.
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter?
I do indeed, my lord.
Then by all means never let her walk in public.
Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend.
A lot of words.
And what is the subject?
Between whom?
I mean, what do the words say?
Oh, just lies, sir.
Into my grave.
Well, that’s certainly out of this world, all right.
You can’t take anything from me that I care less about—except my life, except my life, except my life.
Good-bye, my lord.
You’re looking for Lord Hamlet.
He’s right over there.
Thank you, sir.
My lord!
My dear sir!
Ah, my good old friends!
How are you, Guildenstern?
And Rosencrantz!
Boys, how are you both doing?
Happy that we’re not too happy, lucky in being not too lucky.
But you’re not down and out, either, are you?
So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist?
Yes, we’re the privates in her army.
Anyway, what’s up?
But you’re wrong.
Let me ask you a particular question.
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison?
Prison, my lord?
Denmark’s a prison.
Then I guess the whole world is one.
Yes, quite a large one, with many cells and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.
We don’t think so, my lord.
Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it.
And to me, Denmark is a prison.
That must be because you’re so ambitious.
It’s too small for your large mind.
Dreams are a sign of ambition, since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream.
But a dream itself is just a shadow.
In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow.
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars.
Should we go inside?
Well, then, I thank you, though I’m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much.
Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative?
What should we say, my lord?
You were sent for.
I know the king and queen sent for you.
Why would they do that, my lord?
That’s what I want you to tell me.
My lord, we were sent for.
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day?
Who can explain this to me?
I can.
Or at least I can describe the rumors.
So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me?
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome.
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield, the lover will be rewarded for his sighs, the crazy character can rant all he wants, the clown will make everybody laugh, and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind, or I’ll stop the play.
Which troupe is it?
The tragic actors from the city, the ones you used to enjoy so much.
What are they doing on the road?
They made more money and got more attention in the city.
But things have changed there, and it’s easier for them on the road now.
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city?
Do they attract big audiences?
No, not like before.
Why?
Are they getting rusty?
No, they’re busy and as excellent as ever.
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it.
These child actors are now in fashion, and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all, they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys.
What, you mean kid actors?
Who takes care of them?
Who pays their way?
Will they stop working when their voices mature?
Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors, which they are going to grow up and become?
There’s been a whole debate on the topic.
For a while, no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles.
Are you kidding?
Oh, there’s been a lot of quarreling.
And the boys are winning so far?
Actually, it’s not so unusual when you think about it.
My uncle is king of Denmark, and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him.
There’s something downright unnatural about it, if a philosopher stopped to think about it.
The actors are here.
Gentlemen, welcome to Elsinore.
Don’t be shy—shake hands with me.
And if we don’t shake hands, when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I’m happier to see them than you.
You are very welcome here.
But still, my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea.
In what sense, my lord?
I’m only crazy sometimes.
At other times, I know what’s what.
Gentlemen, I hope you are well.
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, Rosencrantz—listen as close as you can!
Yes, the second time around, since, as they say, old people become children again.
My lord, I have news for you.
My lord, I have news for you.
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome — The actors have arrived, my lord.
Yawn, snore.
I swear— —each actor arrived on his ass.
Well,        Aren’t I right, Jephthah, old man?
If you’re calling me Jephthah, my lord, I do have a daughter I love more than anything, yes.
What is logical, then, my lord?
Why,
Welcome, welcome to all of you.
Which speech, my lord?
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy. 
I loved one speech in particular.
This speech is going on too long.
We’ll have the barber trim it later, along with your beard.
The muffled queen”?
That’s good.
The muffled queen” is good.
Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes.
My lord, I will give them all they deserve.
Good heavens, man, give them more than that!
Treat them with honor and dignity.
The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth.
Lead them inside.
Come, everyone.
Follow him, friends.
We’ll watch a whole play tomorrow.
Yes, my lord.
Then we’ll see that tomorrow night.
By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right?
Yes, my lord.
Very well.
Follow that gentleman now, and be careful not to make fun of him.
My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow.
Welcome to Elsinore.
Yes, my lord.
Now I’m alone.
Oh, what a mean low-life I am!
For Hecuba!
The ghost is definitely something to worry about.
In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish.
Wait, look!
It has come again.
I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do.
If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me.
Am I a coward?
Pull off my beard?
Pinch my nose?
Call me the worst liar?
Bloody, inhuman villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain!
Ah, revenge!
What an ass I am.
Damn it!
Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak.
If he becomes pale, I know what to do.
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with.
The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.
And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?
Did he treat you well when you saw him?
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.
He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length.
Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here.
They are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight.
It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to attend.
It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested.
Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let this play do him some good.
We will, my lord.
Yes, I’ll go.
I hope so too, Madam.
Ophelia, come here.—   I hear him coming.
Quick, let’s hide, my lord.
Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for.
To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream.
That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long.
After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits?
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t?
But  Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately?
Very well, thank you.
Well, well, well.
My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now.
Please take them.
There, my lord.
Ha ha, are you good?
Excuse me?
Are you beautiful?
My lord, what are you talking about?
I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty.
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness?
Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin.
This used to be a great puzzle, but now I’ve solved it.
I used to love you.
You certainly made me believe you did, my lord.
I didn’t love you.
Then I guess I was misled.
Get yourself to a 
I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in.
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven?
Every one of us is a criminal.
Don’t believe any of us.
Hurry to a convent.
Where’s your father?
He’s at home, my lord.
Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only.
Good-bye.
Oh, dear God, please help him!
Get yourself to a convent, at once.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Dear God, please make him normal again!
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too.
God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it.
You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance.
Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore.
It’s driven me crazy.
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage.
Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person.
Everyone else will have to stay single.
Get yourself to a convent, fast.
Love?
His feelings don’t move in that direction.
With any luck, the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind.
What do you think of this plan?
It should work.
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—Hello, Ophelia.
You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
I’ll hide and listen in.
If she can’t find out what his secret is, then send him off to England or wherever you think best.
That’s how we’ll do it, then.
If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor, speak to me.
Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it.
Stay and speak!
Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.
Should I strike it with my spear?
Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.
It’s over here.
There it is.
It’s gone.
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.
Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows.
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical.
Please avoid doing that.
I will, sir.
But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you.
I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company, sir.
Oh, correct it completely.
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib, since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them, while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed.
Yes, he will, and the queen as well.
Tell the actors to hurry.
Will you two help them get ready?
Yes, my lord.
Well, hello there, Horatio!
Here I am at your service, my dear lord.
Horatio, you’re the best man I’ve ever known.
Oh, sir— Don’t think I’m flattering you.
What could I hope to get from you, who’ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life?
Why would anyone flatter a poor person?
No, keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well.
You understand?
Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends, I’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance, grateful for both good and bad.
Watch him closely.
They’re coming.
I can’t talk now.
Take your seat.
So how’s my nephew Hamlet doing?
Wonderful!
I eat the air, like chameleons do.
I’m positively stuffed with air, I eat so much of it.
I have no idea what you’re talking about, Hamlet.
You’re not answering my question.
Mine, neither.
Indeed I did, my lord.
What role did you play?
I played Julius Caesar.
I was killed in the Capitol.
Brutus killed me.
Yes, my lord.
They’re ready whenever you are.
No thanks, my good mother.
There’s a nicer piece of work right here.
My lady, should I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.
I mean, with my head in your lap?
Yes, my lord.
Did you think I was talking about sex?
What is, my lord?
Nothing.
You’re in a good mood tonight, my lord.
Who, me?
Yes, my lord.
Oh God—who is, by the way, the best comic of them all.
What can you do but be happy?
Look how cheerful my mother is, only two hours after my father died.
No, my lord, it’s been four months.
As long as that?
I’ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit.
In that case, there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months.
But he’s got to build churches for that to happen, my lady, or else he’ll have to put up with being forgotten, like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes, “Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, the hobby-horse is forgotten.”   What does this mean, my lord?
This means we’re having some mischievous fun.
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play.
This guy will tell us everything.
Actors can’t keep a secret.
They’ll tell all.
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant?
Sure, or anything else you show him.
As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.
You’re naughty.
I’m watching the play.
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring?
It was a bit short, my lord.
Yes, as short as a woman’s love.
Madam, how are you liking this play?
The lady’s overdoing it, I think.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
Is there anything offensive in it?
Not offensive at all.
What’s the play called?
Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed.
Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this, out of duty and love?
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me.
We’re all waiting for the revenge!  
The original story was written in the finest Italian.
You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife.
The king is getting up.
What—is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank?
My lord, how are you feeling?
Get me out of here!
Lights, lights, get us some lights!
No, a whole share for me.
Did you notice?
Yes, I did, my lord.
When the actors were talking about poison?
I watched him very closely.
Ah ha!
Hey, let’s have some music here!
Play your flutes!
Come on, music!
My lord, could I have a word with you?
You can have a whole story, not just a word.
Sir, the king— Yes, what about him?
He’s in his chambers now, and he’s extremely upset.
I’ll be good, sir.
Go ahead.
The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you.
It’s lovely to see you.
No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point.
If you could please stop fooling around, I’ll tell you what your mother wants.
If not, I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business.
Sir, I can’t.
Can’t what, my lord?
Stop fooling around.
My mind is confused.
Okay, to the point.
Oh, what a wonderful son, I can impress my mother!
But what’s the upshot of her admiration?
Do tell.
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.
I’d obey even if she were my mother ten times over.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
My lord, you used to like me.
And still do, I swear by my hands.
My lord, what’s wrong with you?
Sir, I have no future ahead of me.
But how can you say that, when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne?
I don’t really understand what you mean.
Will you play this recorder?
I can’t, my lord.
Please.
I’m serious, I can’t.
I’m begging you.
I have no idea how.
Oh, it’s as easy as lying.
But I can’t play a melody.
I don’t know how.
My God, do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe?
You can push my buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool.
Hello and God bless you, sir.
My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right away.
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel?
By God, it does look like a camel.
To me it looks like a weasel.
It does have a back like a weasel’s.
Or like a whale.
Yes, very much like a whale.
I’ll go see my mother soon.
I’ll tell her.
This is the time of night when witches come out, when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out.
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight.
I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her, but I won’t use one on her.
And so, my words and thoughts will be at odds.
I don’t like the way he’s acting, and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control.
So get prepared.
I’m sending you to England on diplomatic business, and Hamlet will go with you.
As king, I cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour.
We’ll take care of it.
When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him.
He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it.
Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.
Prepare yourself, please, for this trip.
We’ll put a leash on this danger that’s now running wild.
We’ll hurry.
My lord, Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room.
I’ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say.
I bet she’ll chew him out.
And as you said (and you said it wisely), it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them, since she can be too partial to him.
Goodbye, my lord.
I’ll stop by before you go to bed, and tell you what I’ve heard.
Thanks, my dear lord.
It has the mark of 
So much for Fortinbras.
That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen.
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime?
In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside.
But not in heaven.
What is there left to do?
But it can’t help either!
My heart’s as black as death.
My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks.
Help me, angels!
C’mon, make an effort.
I could do it easily now.
He’s praying now.
And now I’ll do it. 
He’ll come right away.
I’ll be right here, silent.
Have you forgotten who I am?
No, sit down.
What are you going to do?
You won’t kill me, will you?
Repent and avoid damnation.
Good night to you.
Who would do that?
What is it, Laertes?
What would you like, Laertes?
Please, let me go.
I have to go to England, don’t you know that?
What, Gertrude?
How is Hamlet?
Oh, this is terrible!
His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone.
I’ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
Believe what?
Besides, you’re a sponge!
You think I’m a sponge, my lord?
I’m glad about that.
A thing of no importance.
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose!
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.
But where is he?
Bring him to me.
At dinner.
What do you mean by that?
Where is Polonius?
In heaven.
So get ready to leave.
Good.
Don’t waste any time.
I’ll tell him, my lord.
Go ahead, then.
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier?
In the end I grudgingly consented.
I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a good time.
So why does it seem so particular to you?
So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it.
Good-bye, sir.
Start without me.
My God!
I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it.
I won’t speak to her.
She’s insistent.
In fact, she’s crazed.
What does she want?
Show her in.  
Please just listen.
Oh, ho!
May God be at your table.
Come, driver!
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.
Follow her.
Listen!
What is it?
Where’s this so-called king?
Please wait.
Thank you.
Let him go, Gertrude.
Where’s my father?
He’s dead.
Don’t mess with me.
Only my free will—nothing else.
Do you want to know who they are, then?
What’s that noise?
Please remember, love.
It’s not manly.
And you’re right to do so.
Please, come with me.
Who are the people who want to speak with me?
Sailors, sir.
They say they have letters for you.
Show them in.
Hello, sir.
God bless you.
May He bless you, too.
He will, sir, if He wants to.
I have a lot to tell you about them.
Good-bye.
It looks that way.
I didn’t see them.
Laertes, I want you to hear what they say.
What does this mean?
Do you recognize the handwriting?
Naked,” he says.
And in a P.S.
But let him come.
That’ll be fine.
All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your best attribute.
What quality is that, my lord?
Yes, from Normandy.
Yes, that’s the one.
I know him well.
He’s his homeland’s jewel.
How could you ask?
That’s the right answer—it shows your love.
Let’s go.
Damn it!
But wait, what’s that sound?
Drowned?
So she is drowned.
Let’s follow him, Gertrude.
Let’s follow him.
Here’s the water, right?
Is that how the law sees it?
It sure is.
The coroner’s inquest law.
Do you want to know the truth?
Well there, now you’ve said it.
Come on, shovel.
They keep up Adam’s profession.
What, aren’t you a Christian?
I’ll ask you another question.
If you can’t answer it— Go ahead!
But how?
Ah, I’ve got it!
Go ahead.
Now go and get me some booze.
Yes, exactly.
Indeed, my lord.
Exactly.
There’s another.
Could that be a lawyer’s skull?
No more than that, my lord.
Yes, my lord, and calfskin too.
It’s mine, sir.
For no man, sir.
How literal this guy is!
You don’t know that?
He’ll recover his sanity there.
Why not?
What do you mean, “in a strange way”?
On what grounds?
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?
A leathermaker will last nine years.
Whose was it?
A crazy bastard.
Who do you think?
I really don’t know.
Damn that crazy madman!
This one?
Yes, that one.
Are you sad about that?
Horatio, tell me something.
Oh God, do I have to remember that?
She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him.
Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried.
That’s not good, and no good can come of it either.
Hello, sir.
Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name, right?
That’s me, sir.
I’ll change that name for you.
Hello, sir.
What’s that, my lord?
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried?
Exactly like that.
And smelled like that, too?
Whew!
Just as bad, my lord.
How low we can fall, Horatio.
Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel?
If you thought that you’d be thinking too much.
No, not at all.
The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away.
Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall!
But quiet, be quiet a minute.
Here comes the king, the queen, and the noblemen of court.
Who are they following?
Let’s stay and watch a while.
What other rites are you going to give her?
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body.
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin, with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her.
Isn’t there any other rite you can perform?
No, nothing.
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them.
Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh!
I’m telling you, you jerk priest, my sister will be an angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell.  
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl.
Goodbye!
Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind.
Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more.
That’s no way to pray.
Pull them apart.
Oh, my son, what issue is that?
I loved Ophelia.
Forty thousand brothers, if you added all their love together, couldn’t match mine.
What are you going to do for her?
Oh, he’s crazy, Laertes!
For the love of God, be patient with him.
Damn it, show me what you’re going to do for her.
Will you cry?
Fight?
Stop eating?
Cut yourself?
I’ll do all that.
And if you rattle on about mountains, then let them throw millions of acres over us.
This is pure insanity.
He’ll be like this for a little while.
Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch.
I always loved you.
But it doesn’t matter.
Please, Horatio, go with him.  
Who’s there?
No, who are  Long live the king!
Is that Barnardo?
Yes, it’s me.
You’ve come right on time.
The clock’s just striking twelve.
Go home to bed, Francisco.
Thanks for letting me go.
It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed.
Has it been a quiet night?
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak.
Well, good night.
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to hurry.
I think I hear them.
That’s enough about that.
Now I’ll tell you the other story about my journey.
Do you remember the circumstances?
How could I forget, my lord!
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep.
It was worse than being a captive in chains.
Is it possible?
Yes, please tell me.
Do you want to know what I wrote?
Yes, my lord.
I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, with the royal seal of Denmark on it.
I folded up the new document, signed it, sealed it, and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference.
The next day we had our fight at sea, and you know what happened after that.
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it.
Man, they were asking for it.
I don’t feel guilty about them at all.
They got what they deserved.
It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents.
What a king Claudius is!
Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience?
And wouldn’t I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm?
He’ll find out soon what happened in England.
Soon enough.
But I have the meantime.
I’ll be nice to him.
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury.
Hang on a minute—who are you?
Welcome back to Denmark, my lord.
Thank you kindly, sir.
My lord, if you have a free moment, I have a message from His Majesty.
No thank you, my lord.
It’s very hot.
It is rather cold, indeed, my lord.
And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid, which is bad for my complexion.
Yes indeed it is, sir.
Very humid, I can’t tell you how humid it is.
My lord, His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he’s placed a large bet on you.
This is what it’s all about— Please, I beg you— No, my lord, I’m comfortable like this, thank you.
Sir, your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities, though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin, and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him.
I felt like skipping school, sir.
I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that, and I won’t believe it from you.
I know you’d never skip school.
What are you doing here in Elsinore?
I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave.
Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral.
Please, don’t make fun of me.
I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead.
Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after.
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet.
Oh, I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio, than have lived through that terrible day!
My father—I think I see my father.
Where, sir?
In my imagination, Horatio.
I saw him once.
He was an admirable king.
He was a great human being.
He was perfect in everything.
I’ll never see the likes of him again.
You speak absolutely correctly, sir.
And what’s the point, sir?
Why are we talking about him like this?
Sorry, sir?
I know you know something— Thanks for the compliment, I’m happy you know that.
But in fact it doesn’t say much.
I’m sorry, you were saying?
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is—
I can’t admit that, since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine.
Excellent in fencing, I mean, sir.
The rapier and the dagger.
Those are only two of his weapons.
But, go on.
The king has bet six Barbary horses, and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories.
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed, and they match the fencing accessories.
What do you mean by “carriages”?
The carriages, sir, are the hangers—where the swords hang.
Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon.
I prefer to call it a “hanger.” But anyway.
Six Barbary horses, six French swords with accessories, and three imaginatively designed carriages—sounds like a French bet against the Danish.
Why has all this been put on the table?
The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits.
But what if my answer’s no?
It’s my exercise time.
My services are at your command.
Thank you.
It’s a good thing he’s here to recommend himself.
No one else would.
He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it.
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away, or wait awhile.
I’ll do whatever the king wants.
If he’s ready now, so am I.
Otherwise, I’ll do it anytime, as long as I’m able.
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else.
Right on cue.
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes—politely—before you begin your match.
She’s full of good advice.
You’re going to lose this bet, my lord.
I don’t think so.
I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France.
With the handicap they’ve given me, I think I’ll win.
But I have a sinking feeling anyway.
Oh well.
I’ll say you’re not feeling well.
You’ll do no such thing.
I thumb my nose at superstitions.
What’s important is to be prepared.
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind, then what does it mean to leave early?
Let it be.
Come shake hands with Laertes, Hamlet.
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so.
Yes, hand me one too.
I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes.
You’re making fun of me.
No, I swear I’m not.
Yes, my lord, quite well.
You’ve bet on the weaker fencer.
I’ve seen both of you fence.
But since Laertes is better, we’ve given him a handicap.
Yes, my lord.
Put the goblets of wine on that table.
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute.
I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health, and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings.
Give me the goblets.
Come on, sir.
Come on, my lord.
That was one hit.
No, it wasn’t.
Referee!
It was obviously a hit.
Well, let’s go on.
Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours.
Here’s to your health.
Give him the goblet.
Set it down awhile.
Let’s play.
Another hit.
What do you say?
You got me, I admit it.
My son will win.
He’s flabby and out of breath.—Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead.
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet. 
Thank you, madam.
Gertrude, don’t drink that.
Excuse me.
I’ll drink it if I like.
I’d better not drink now.
I’ll drink later.
Come on, let me wipe your face.
I doubt it.
Get ready for the third hit, Laertes.
You’re just playing around.
Come on, give me your best shot.
I sense you’re treating me like a child.
You think so?
Come on.
Take this!
Separate them.
They’re overdoing it.
No, come on, one more time.
Take care of the queen!
Both fencers are bleeding—how do you feel, my lord?
How do you feel, Laertes?
Like a mouse caught in my own trap, Osric.
How’s the queen?
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding.
The drink, the drink!
I’ve been poisoned.
Oh, what evil!
Lock the door.
We’ve been betrayed!
Find out who did it!
I’m the one, Hamlet.
Hamlet, you’re dead.
No medicine in the world can cure you.
You don’t have more than half an hour to live.
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand, sharp and dipped in poison.
The foul plan backfired on me.
Here I lie and will never get up again.
Your mother’s been poisoned.
I can’t speak anymore.
The king, the king’s to blame.
Then get to work, poison!
Sir, I think I saw him last night.
Saw who?
The king my father?!
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as witnesses.
For God’s sake, let me hear it.
After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe.
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak.
I knew your father.
But where did this happen?
Treason!
Treason!
Protect me, my friends.
I’ve only been hurt, not killed.
Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this.
Is your little pearl in there?
Follow my mother.
He got what he deserved.
He mixed that poison himself.
Please forgive me as I forgive you, Hamlet.
You’re not responsible for my death and my father’s, and I’m not responsible for yours.
God will free you from blame.
You’re alive.
Not for a second.
I’m more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane.
Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet. 
Please, give me that goblet, if you love me.
Let go of it!
I’ll get it from you, I swear.
Oh God, Horatio, what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me, as no one knows the truth.
If you ever loved me, then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile, and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story.
What are these warlike noises?
Young Fortinbras, returning in triumph from Poland, is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors.
Oh, I’m dying, Horatio!
This strong poison’s overpowering me.
I will not live to hear the news from England.
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown.
He’s got my vote as I die.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
What do I see here?
What would you like to see?
These corpses suggest mayhem.
Oh, proud Death, what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke?
This is a horrible sight.
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Who will thank us now?
As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage.
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities.
Pick up the corpses.
On the platform where we stand guard, sir.
Didn’t you talk to it?
I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me.
That’s very strange.
I swear to God it’s true, sir.
We thought you ought to know about it.
Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me.
Are you on duty again tonight?
Yes, sir.
It was armed, you say?
Armed, sir.
From head to toe?
Yes, from top to bottom, sir.
So you couldn’t see his face, then?
Oh, yes, we could, sir.
He had his helmet visor up.
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced?
Very pale, sir.
Did he stare at you?
The whole time.
I wish I’d been there.
Did it stay a long time?
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred.
No, longer than that.
Not the time I saw it.
His beard was gray, right?
It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it.
I’ll stand guard with you tonight.
Maybe it’ll come again.
I bet it will.
If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet.
I ask you, if you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so.
Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it.
I’ll return the favor.
So good-bye for now.
I’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight.
We’ll do our duty to you, sir.
Give me your love instead, as I give you mine.
Good-bye.
My father’s ghost—armed!
Something’s wrong.
I suspect some foul play.
I wish the night were here already!
Until then, I have to remain calm.
Bad deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide them.
My belongings are on the ship already.
Good-bye.
And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you—write.
Do you doubt I’ll write?
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you, just consider it a big flirtation, the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth.
It won’t last.
Not a second more.
No more than a minute?
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands.
Watch out, Ophelia.
Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust.
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease.
So be careful.
Fear will keep you safe.
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others.
I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart.
Don’t worry, I won’t.
I’ve been here too long.
And here comes father.
You’re still here?
Shame on you—get on board!
The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you.
Here, I give you my blessing again.
And just try to remember a few rules of life.
Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think.
Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it.
Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own.
Listen to many people, but talk to few.
Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment.
Good-bye, son.
Your servants are waiting.
It’s locked away in my memory, and you’ve got the key.
Good-bye.
What did he tell you, Ophelia?
Something about Hamlet.
If things are the way people tell me they are—and they’re only telling me this to warn me—then I have to say, you’re not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show.
What’s going on between you two?
Tell me the truth.
He’s offered me a lot of affection lately.
Affection!” That’s nothing!
You’re talking like some innocent girl who doesn’t understand the ways of the world.
Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?
I don’t know what to believe, father.
Then I’ll tell you.
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real.
Offer yourself more respect, or—not to beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock.
Go on.
And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says.
These vows are just traps for stupid birds.
I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything.
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do.
Do as I say.
Now come along.
I’ll do as you say, father.
Friends of this country.
And servants of the Danish king.
Good night to you both.
Good-bye.
Who’s taken over the watch for you?
Barnardo’s taken my place.
Good night.
Is Horatio here too?
More or less.
So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight?
I haven’t seen anything.
Horatio says we’re imagining it, and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now.
That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.
Yes, it’s definitely nippy.
What time is it?
A little before twelve, I think.
No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock strike.
Really?
I didn’t hear it.
So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear.
What does that mean, sir?
Is that a tradition?
Yes, it is.
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it.
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying.
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles.
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations.
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.
Look, sir—here it comes!
Oh angels, protect us!
Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon, whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire, whether your intentions are good or evil, you look so strange I want to talk to you.
I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” Answer me!
Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity, but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin, and why your tomb,
where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again.
Why?
It wants you to go off with it, as if it wants to tell you something alone.
Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away.
But don’t go.
Definitely not.
Don’t do it, sir.
Why, what’s the danger?
And as for my soul, how can the ghost endanger that, since it’s as immortal as the ghost is?
Look, it’s waving me over again.
I’ll follow it.
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane.
Think about it.
It’s still waving to me.
You’re not going, sir.
Let go of me.
Calm down.
You’re not going anywhere.
Let me go, gentlemen.
I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of him!
His imagination is making him crazy.
Let’s follow them.
It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone.
No, let’s follow him.
Where are you taking me?
Speak.
Listen to me.
I will.
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory.
Ah, poor ghost!
Speak.
I’m ready to hear you.
You must be ready for revenge, too, when you hear me out.
What?
I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins.
If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of 
make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills.
But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife.
Listen, listen!
If you ever loved your poor dear father— Oh God!
Take revenge for his horrible murder, that crime against nature.
Murder?
His most horrible murder.
Murder’s always horrible, but this one was especially horrible, weird, and unnatural.
You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it!
My uncle?
Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell!
She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine.
So let me be brief here.
And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once.
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible!
If you are human, don’t stand for it.
Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest.
Leave her to God and her own guilt.
Now, good-bye.
The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near.
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye.
Remember me.
Ah, all you up in heaven!
And earth!
What else?
Shall I include hell as well?
Damn it!
Keep beating, my heart, and muscles, don’t grow old yet—keep me standing.
Remember you!
Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head.
Remember you!
Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there.
Yes, by God!
Oh, you evil woman!
Oh, you villain, villain, you damned, smiling villain!
Where’s my notebook?—It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile, and be a villain.
At least it’s possible in Denmark. 
He said, “Remember me.” I swore I would.
Sir, sir!
Lord Hamlet.— Please let him be all right!
I’m all right.
Oh-ho-ho, sir!
Oh-ho-ho, kid!
Come here.
So how did it go, sir?
What happened, sir?
It was incredible!
Oh, please, tell us, sir.
I swear I won’t, sir.
I won’t either, sir.
Okay.
But you promise you can keep a secret?
Yes, I swear.
Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.
Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— Quiet, shut up!
It’s come again.
Looking just like the dead king.
Very much so.
It’s terrifying.
It wants us to speak to it.
Ask it something, Horatio.
By God, I order you to speak.
Any villain in Denmark is going to be, well, a villain.
You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that, sir.
Yes, you’re absolutely right.
So, without further ado, the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways.
You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of, whatever it is worth), and I’ll go and pray.
You’re talking in such a crazy way, sir.
No offense taken.
Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense.
As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much.
But regarding what happened between us, don’t ask—I can’t tell you.
And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor.
What is it, sir?
Of course we will.
Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight.
We won’t, sir.
No, you have to swear it.
I swear to God I won’t.
Me too, I won’t, I swear to God.
Swear by my sword.
But we already swore, sir.
Yes, but swear by my sword this time.
Agree to swear.
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen.
Swear by my sword.
Come over here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again.
Swear by my sword you’ll never mention what you’ve heard.
You said it right, old mole.
What a tunneler!
Let’s move again, my friends.
My God, this is unbelievably strange.
Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of.
Swear you won’t.
Let’s go back to court together, but 
Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo.
I will, sir.
It would be wonderfully wise of you, my dear Reynaldo, to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him.
That’s what I thought too, sir.
Excellent, very good.
Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo?
Yes, very well, sir.
You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well.
Isn’t he the one who’s always,” and so on.
Like gambling, sir?
That’s right, or drinking, swearing, fist-fighting, visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing.
But that would ruin his reputation!
Oh no, not if you say it right.
But, sir— Why should you do this, you want to know?
Yes, sir.
I’d like to know.
Yes, sir.
And then he’ll … he’ll … wait, what was I about to say?
Good God, I was about to say something.
What was I saying?
I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever.
You get my point, don’t you?
Yes, I do, sir.
God bless you.
Have a safe trip.
Thank you, sir.
I will, sir.
And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to.
Got it, sir.
Good-bye.
From what, in God’s name?
Is he crazy with love for you?
What did he say?
He stayed like that a long time.
Finally, after shaking my arm a little, and jerking his head up and down three times, he sighed like it was his last breath.
Come with me.
I’ll go tell the king about this.
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion.
I’m so sorry.
That’s what made him crazy.
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that.
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation.
Damn my suspicious thoughts!
It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy.
Come on, let’s go see the king.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away.
You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before.
I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death.
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely.
But we’ll obey.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much.
Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet.
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good!
Amen to that!
The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.
Once again you bring good news.
Do I, sir?
I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king. 
It looks like you’ve offended it.
Look, it’s going away.
Stay!
I order you, speak!
What’s going on, Horatio?
You’re pale and trembling.
You agree now that we’re not imagining this, don’t you?
What do you think about it?
I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it.
Doesn’t it look like the king?
Yes, as much as you look like yourself.
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway.
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles, traveling on the ice in sleds.
It’s weird.
And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy.
Tell me!
I want very much to find out.
All right, but first let the ambassadors speak.
Then you can hear my news, as dessert.
Then be so kind as to show them in.
Gertrude, he says he’s found out the reason for your son’s insanity.
I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason: his father’s dying and our quick marriage.
Welcome, my good friends.
Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway?
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest.
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again.
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand  I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply.
Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts.
Go relax now.
Tonight we’ll have dinner.
Welcome back!
Well, that turned out well in the end.
Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time.
Your son is crazy.
Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness?
But that’s another story.
Think about it.
I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty.
Madam, please be patient.
I’ll read it to you.
Oh, Ophelia, I’m bad at poetry.
I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all.
Believe it.
Hamlet.” Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter, and more like it.
And how did she react to all this?
Sir, what is your opinion of me?
I know you are loyal and honorable.
I would like to prove to you that I am.
No, I had to do something.
And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league.
It may be, it certainly may be.
Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true?
Not that I know of.
What can we do to find out if it’s true?
Well, you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time.
Yes, he does.
When he’s there next time, I’ll send my daughter to see him.
Please go away, both of you.
I’ll speak to him now.
Oh, please let me.
How are you, Hamlet?
Fine, thank you.
Do you know who I am?
