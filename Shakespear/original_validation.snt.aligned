Hard, hard.—O filthy traitor!
For do but stand upon the foaming shore, The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds, The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, Seems to cast water on the burning bear, And quench the guards of th' ever-fixèd pole.

We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness.
Take me up.
Will you go?
No, not a whit.
What would you with me, honest neighbor?
Four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster.
I have offended reputation, A most unnoble swerving.
Wouldst thou give 'em all?
Look, here comes the duke.
And when shalt thou see him again?
I remember.
Oh, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
