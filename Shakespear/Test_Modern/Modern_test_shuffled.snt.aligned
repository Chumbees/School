Here, madam.
What is it, Agrippa?
My songbird, we have beaten them to their beds.
But where did this happen?
Oh God, Horatio, what a damaged reputation I’m leaving behind me, as no one knows the truth.
Is all of this about your father?
Yes, quite a large one, with many cells and dungeons, Denmark being one of the worst.
No, a whole share for me.
Yes sir, I’m fairly witty.
Where did you hear this?
Many times, madam.
That’s well spoken.
Fight?
Come on. 
What did he say the symptoms were?
And like I am for Rosalind.
Or if you haven’t broken away from human company, as my feelings now lead me to do, you haven’t loved.
But a dream itself is just a shadow.
No more, no more.
Give me your love instead, as I give you mine.
I wish you had told me you had a different father.
Do I have the asp’s poison on my lips?
Yes, on land you do outnumber me.
Greetings, Caesar, my lord!
Carriage” makes it sound like it’s pulling around a cannon.
Antony will go where his passion is.
Oliver, your brother—no, not your brother; and yet he’s the son—but no, I won’t call him the son—of that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight he’s planning on burning your house down, with you in it.
I’ll drink later.
A worthy fool!
Come shake hands with Laertes, Hamlet.
I’ll let you know right away how it’s going.
What’s going on in here?
Give my answer to them both.
Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger.
Tell him I want to speak with him.
I think I hear Antony call me.
No, I’m sure your Grace won’t be able to persuade him to try a second round, even though you couldn’t dissuade him from trying the first.
It means being full of sighs and tears, like I am for Phoebe.
He’s speaking now, or perhaps he’s whispering, “Where’s my serpent of the Nile?” For that’s his pet name for me.
Wonderful!
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred.
Don’t insult me with your distrust.
Wait, look!
Pick up the corpses.
And as you said (and you said it wisely), it’s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them, since she can be too partial to him.
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring?
Let’s go.
Why,
Well there, now you’ve said it.
I can’t watch any more.
I’m glad about that.
She’s dead, my Queen.
How do you mean, “conspired”?
I’ll return the favor.
My lord, you used to like me.
These corpses suggest mayhem.
Now come along.
The battle on the sea is almost lost.
Madam?
He’s recruited Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; the King of Pont; Herod, of Judea; Mithridates, King of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, the kings of Mede and Lycaonia, and many more.
This way, we can see how the world moves.
There is nothing distinctive, nothing remarkable left in the world.
He turned away twice and almost left him there.
You think I’m a sponge, my lord?
I don’t expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion.
Yes, my lord.
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does.
Here, my good lord.
Lights, lights, get us some lights!
They have a massive army.
It would be wonderfully wise of you, my dear Reynaldo, to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him.
That was nothing.
Go to the harbor immediately!
Crazy” I’m calling it, since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness?
Call him in.
Murder’s always horrible, but this one was especially horrible, weird, and unnatural.
Another hit.
There were many even more memorable feasts.
I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness.
I know where she is and, if you don’t mind, I will set her before you tomorrow, whole and unharmed.
I can’t imagine what’s made him so unlike himself, other than his father’s death.
Here, at your service.
And he’s friendly with Caesar.
Come on.
Dear sir, I pity the lady and wish—more for her sake than my own—that I was more able to help her.
I almost feel you.
Good-bye.
He’s married, madam.
Lead the way.
We’ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways.
But since Laertes is better, we’ve given him a handicap.
Maybe?
My master and my lord!
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one.
You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me.
Let’s carry him to the barracks.
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery.
I’m afraid you’ve sold your own land to see other men’s.
Go find him.
I’ve only done my duty.
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished.
You can be married tomorrow if you want.
That’s what made him crazy.
He has captured Toryne.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
I loved Ophelia.
With all my heart, Phoebe.
Don’t shed even one tear.
Are they getting rusty?
Come on, shovel.
Come on, then.
Friends, come here.
No, some of it is about my child’s father.
You don’t have a man’s courage.
I’m telling you, you jerk priest, my sister will be an angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell.  
Oh, damn, damn, damn!
How are you, Guildenstern?
In my imagination, Horatio.
Don’t think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind.
Speak to us.
You will never be able to say the same about me.
Some of them are leaning already.
Caesar, what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you?
Were you born here in the forest?
Now I feel my soul leaving.
I remember, Adam, that’s  Here comes my master, your brother.
He can’t be Fortune; he’s only Fortune’s errand boy.
Your love’s name is Rosalind?
I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason.
Thank you, sir.
Antony’s wife should have an army to escort her, with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears.
Actually, an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak, and he was brought up in the city.
It was incredible!
In any case, our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible.
This is my treasurer.
Laertes, I want you to hear what they say.
I’ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart.
Those tears will bring blessings to you.
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life, unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death, the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns, which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t?
This one?
No thanks, my good mother.
Lay her in the ground, and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh!
The king my father?!
It wants you to go off with it, as if it wants to tell you something alone.
How are you, soldier?
All your talents and gifts didn’t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did, though to me it’s far from your best attribute.
I’m begging you, take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news.
Though that must have been a pitiful sight, the ground looked beautiful.
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me.
Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway?
No, gentle madam.
Indeed I did, my lord.
It is.
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that.
For the favor of sleeping in her bed.
I’m sick, Charmian.
Buck up, boy!
Yes, from Normandy.
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage.
Tell me!
I’m telling you, it’s hers.
Do you believe his “offers,” as you call them?
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind.
If she’s a traitor, why then, so am I.
Madam, some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here.
Don’t you know that I’m a woman?
But, oh, it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes.
Even if we said that this behavior suits him—though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics—there’s no excuse for the extra work we’ve had to take on while he’s been off amusing himself.
In fact, I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it’s only the shadow of a shadow.
Believe it.
Who was with them last?
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain’s rival.
Caesar hanged him for this service.
The gods can hear you lying!
With my music playing in the background, I’ll lure fish.
Did you fall?
We’re friends!
You’ve only insulted yourself.
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it.
Oh angels, protect us!
We came here to fight against you.
It’s over here.
Saw who?
You’re bleeding a lot.
Well, then, help me.
Madam, he’s well.
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap.
Right on cue.
I didn’t think I would see you here.
You can push my buttons, but you can’t play me for a fool.
Fix your example, shepherd.
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations.
There, Diomedes, there.
It’s not manly.
Come, sweet Audrey.
My uncle is king of Denmark, and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him.
That’s the one part of my service on land I do deny.
Why, because we’re always handling our ewes, and their fleece, as you know, is greasy.
Don’t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea.
How’s the queen?
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well, without owing my master anything.
Have you heard of me, most noble Empress?
No, don’t cry, kind Eros.
There’s nothing of the weak woman left in me.
Put the goblets of wine on that table.
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail, as formidable as the sea itself.
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart.
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon.
Yes, sir.
That’s me, sir.
Well then, you have good reason to be sad.
Invite all my sad captains.
This poor virgin isn’t much to look at, sir, but she’s mine.
So why does it seem so particular to you?
You think about him too much.
I assure you it is, madam.
She creeps along.
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position.
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations.
You, niece.
If things are the way people tell me they are—and they’re only telling me this to warn me—then I have to say, you’re not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show.
Well, then, you don’t have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one.
Come with me.
Well, that turned out well in the end.
Indeed I do, sir, and I’ve come to let you in on a certain problem.
At other times, I know what’s what.
Okay, who does it trot for?
They steal hearts.
Don’t insult my master’s generosity by killing yourself.
Everyone else will have to stay single.
Sir, we came to see your father’s funeral.
Oh, sir, pardon me!
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours, it would be like pitting twenty men against one.
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature.
He’s bound to Octavia.
Lock the door.
I knew your father.
It’s too small for your large mind.
Good luck.
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
The flags have fallen.
Make me believe it?
Then your lips will feel them more quickly.
Call him!
Why don’t you answer me, man?
Good Enobarbus!
Is he still alive?
I have news from Rome, my good lord.
Oh, dear husband, don’t believe everything you hear—or if you must believe it, don’t let it all make you angry.
I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say.
And how, out of your great heap of knowledge, will you manage to prove that?
What did he say?
The present time is like a woman in labor, each minute giving birth to some piece of news.
What are you going to do for her?
Like her?
Now all is for nothing.
Yes, that’s the one.
What’s important is to be prepared.
We still have hope. 
Please rise, Queen.
Be content.
Good luck, sir.
Oh, quick, before I’m gone.
I’m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns.
A mature age.
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind.
Something’s wrong.
Oh, it’s as easy as lying.
They keep up Adam’s profession.
When Duke Frederick heard that great, worthy men were coming to this forest every day, he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother.
What else?
Gentlemen, calm down.
Ophelia, come here.—   I hear him coming.
Have a seat.
But you promise you can keep a secret?
Ask it something, Horatio.
So, without further ado, the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways.
I should have known it.
What you were afraid of has happened.
Okay, to the point.
Yes, and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia, where he fought against Pompey.
Oh, my lord!
I think so too.
Please don’t be offended that I don’t want to offend you any more.
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already.
I know I won’t please you.
Oh, what a wonderful son, I can impress my mother!
So, take me, death!
My lord, what’s wrong with you?
I don’t know what “poetical” means.
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you.
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces.
I’ll do as you say, father.
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt.
But you can’t blame me for her offenses.
I’ll cry at nothing, and I’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood.
Was it you that he rescued?
What do you mean, lady?
He’s a stylish man.
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up?
What are we going to do, Enobarbus?
How can you top that?
Look at this man.
Please, give me that goblet, if you love me.
Let’s go.
What are you doing with a sword?
What’s the news, brave soldier?
I mean, with my head in your lap?
The actors are here.
So, by heaven’s decree, Rosalind Was composed Of different faces, eyes, and hearts, so that she might have the most prized touches of all.
Yes, it’s definitely nippy.
I’ve been here too long.
Be my witness, oh you blessed moon.
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together.
And then again, it’s not so good, but only so-so.
What’s your name?
If we aren’t relieved in an hour, we have to return to our barracks.
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you.
If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases, and that’s his business.
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you.
Let’s go.
I have only come in—like the others have—to try to fight him with the strength of my youth.
Good night.
I will, sir.
where we quietly buried you, has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again.
Isn’t my fortune just a little better than hers?
Sounds good to us.
Tell me, please: how many boys and girls will I have?
That’s treason!
I’d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad—and to travel for all that trouble, no less!
For a while, no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children’s playwright and the actors playing adult roles.
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her.
Sir, your description of him doesn’t detract from his good qualities, though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin, and even so you wouldn’t be able to keep up with him.
Who does it gallop for?
Even my hair revolts.
What is it, sir?
I swear to God I won’t.
I found Orlando under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
That must be because you’re so ambitious.
I’ll hide and listen in.
I will go find him.
Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return.
I can tell you who time strolls for, who it trots for, who it gallops for, and who it stops cold for.
Our land forces have bravely stood firm.
He would never have spoken to me like this.
Let me go with you.
Clouds, dissolve into rain, so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping!
He will, sir, if He wants to.
They’ll be married tomorrow, and I’ll invite the duke to the ceremony.
If not, you can kill me.
Why?
I want to go home.
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good!
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command, instead of asking us so politely.
Oh, you should have done it without telling me!
In a minute, sir.
Get yourself to a convent, fast.
Hate it, fear it, do not come inside.
I haven’t seen him recently.
Lock yourself in and send him word that you’re dead.
It does have a back like a weasel’s.
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl.
I have more reason to be distressed.
I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you.
When good orators finish talking, they spit; when lovers do (God help us if they ever do), they kiss.
How are you doing, Charles?
So beware of my contempt, and keep your promise.
Let the envoy from Antony come in.
Go ahead.
Give me a goblet.—Hamlet, this pearl’s yours.
Where’s the Queen?
Yes, madam, twenty different messengers.
Why should he have followed you?
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb.
Quiet, quiet, Iras.
Which troupe is it?
I’m Sir Rowland’s middle son, and I bring you news.
Which is either a fool or a nothing.
Let’s drink through midnight.
This toast is for Lepidus!
Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands.
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony.
I could do it easily now.
But how can you say that, when the king himself says you’re the heir to the Danish throne?
Oh, Iras, Charmian!
Why?
Before sunrise tomorrow, we’ll kill anyone who escaped today.
When she landed at the port, Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper.
Goodbye, my lord.
Why won’t he?
It’s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart, but bear with me.
There’s a similar mark on her arm. 
You can argue as much as you like when there’s nothing else to do.
Oh, don’t fight by sea, noble Emperor!
Yes, I swear.
What other rites are you going to give her?
It’s been this way ever since the first government was organized.
Your honor is the reason you are leaving.
Tomorrow, Caesar, I’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war.
Here’s more news.
Who can explain this to me?
Watch out, Ophelia.
Here’s to you, Menas.
Which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young.
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court.
A soldier is just a tool, like his sword, unless he has your qualities, Ventidius.
Oh, he’s crazy, Laertes!
What did he say?
My lord is so heavy!
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous.
My features are still that beautiful—or else you, the greatest soldier in the world, have become the greatest liar by overpraising them.
For my part, I’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match.
Tomorrow, sir, I’m fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed.
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
He carries a third of the world.
Who does it stand still for?
Denmark’s a prison.
What you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually.
Really, he’s very witty, and full of wise sayings.
I really don’t know.
Listen, sad friends, though the gods may rebuke me, this news would make kings cry.
But here comes Antony.
I know you know something— Thanks for the compliment, I’m happy you know that.
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried?
He laughed at that and let me go.
But I’m a hired hand: I don’t profit from the flocks I tend.
Oh, come on.—Come here, sir.
The muffled queen”?
Oh, what a mean low-life I am!
Look at them.
He mixed that poison himself.
For no man, sir.
Both fencers are bleeding—how do you feel, my lord?
Really, I’ll help.
I don’t make fortunes; I only see them.
Royal seductress!
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier?
Tell me where you live.
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust.
If you really are Sir Rowland’s son, as you’ve just whispered to me—and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face— you are truly welcome here.
Help us, good friends.
I know they’re in Rome together, hoping for Antony to return.
I beg you, turn away and cry for her.
You’ve heard a lot.
A crazy bastard.
No, I’ve had my say.
I’ll fight brutally.
Quiet!
The wiser the woman, the wilder.
Were you ever at court, shepherd?
I haven’t seen anything.
Happy that we’re not too happy, lucky in being not too lucky.
But he’s got to build churches for that to happen, my lady, or else he’ll have to put up with being forgotten, like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes, “Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, the hobby-horse is forgotten.”   What does this mean, my lord?
But taste my story, and relish it by paying attention.
My lord, I have news for you.
Charles did the same to the second brother, and the third.
Cleopatra— How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true, even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves—you, who were unfaithful to Fulvia?
Gentlemen, welcome to Elsinore.
I eat the air, like chameleons do.
I’m being repaid for that now.
Oh, kill me!
Yes, my lord, and calfskin too.
You are a fool.—You, niece, prepare to leave.
From under the earth.
The king is getting up.
As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.
Isn’t it strange, Canidius, that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne?—Have you heard about this, sweet?
You’ll fight with him eventually, and  The duke, my father, loved his father very much.
Quick, let’s hide, my lord.
Gertrude, don’t drink that.
He’ll go back to his Egyptian dish.
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable.
Enough to buy everything you have declared.
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too.
Oh, poor shepherd!
The gods forbid!
By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father.
If you say it isn’t true, I’ll give you a province and make you rich.
You speak absolutely correctly, sir.
Musicians, come in!
See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity.
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute.
The ambassadors are back from Norway, sir.
She’s more cunning than anyone can imagine.
Thanks for letting me go.
If you won’t listen to reason, I’ll have to die.
Yes, very well, sir.
I won’t trouble you yet with questions about your situation.—Some music, please, and, good friend, sing.
Has it been a quiet night?
Go, and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind. 
Come here, Ventidius.
Kings and noblemen served him.
Here comes my lord.
Nah, I’ll never be aware of my own wit, until I break my shins on it.
Faint, fall down—if you don’t, then you’re lying about my eyes being murderers.
And in a P.S.
Yes, noble lord.
Oh, please let me.
But what do I care about words?
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you.
We’ll have the barber trim it later, along with your beard.
Hurry!
So let me be brief here.
That’s the way it should be—only Antony should conquer Antony.
That’s very strange.
It has been done already, and the messenger is on his way.
You armor my heart.
What do you think, girl!
Only my free will—nothing else.
But how?
Get yourself to a convent, at once.
So how’s my nephew Hamlet doing?
Ha ha, are you good?
Please, will you take his arm?
I’ll tell her.
They have wings.
He’s not very tall, but he’s tall enough for his age.
Quickly, quickly, good Iras, quickly.
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.
I think you came to see my mother’s wedding instead.
Silvius, tell this youth what it means to be in love.
Are you beautiful?
Oh, I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife!
Oh, come quickly!
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her?
Let’s follow him, Gertrude.
What, am I being denied death, as well?
Brutus killed me.
Carry him away.
Did he beg my pardon?
In the high and mighty Roman Empire, just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish.
Amen.
Are you really as in love as your poems declare?
No, don’t be ashamed, Cleopatra.
But stop, I say.
Follow them straight to the cottage.
Where?
It’s bitterly cold out, and I’m depressed.
Someone who was always near you.
Good-bye, great commander.
It’s gone.
Let’s send this news to Rome.
He is close to death, but not dead yet.
Your wit is too courtly for me.
It’s yours, and you may hang us, your trophies of war, anywhere you like.
And I see a lot of Orlando here.
Did you see Octavia?
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield, the lover will be rewarded for his sighs, the crazy character can rant all he wants, the clown will make everybody laugh, and the lady character can say whatever’s on her mind, or I’ll stop the play.
It’s true, and he asked me to beg you both to attend.
You should know, my friends, that I have good hopes for tomorrow, and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death.
Please.
It’s time that we brought our armies into the field.
You refused me both.
Yes, that one.
I swear— —each actor arrived on his ass.
Ah, but there is, Horatio, there’s a lot of offense.
The harvest comes shortly after that.
Therefore, my old age is like a blustery winter: cold, but kindly.
You’re in the charge of an honorable man.
Let me go, I say.
Tell the army to flee.
Naked,” he says.
Right in the middle of the fight, just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral Egyptian nag—May she die of leprosy!—suddenly became frightened, and turned her ships around and fled.
But what if my answer’s no?
You understand?
Then I guess the whole world is one.
Take me to him.
Watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
No way, then, I’ll run.
Very well.
He’s as smart as they come, but just a jester.
It’s undeniable.
He used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it.
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen.” Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse, which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply.
Why, sir, must he?
I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything.
My father—I think I see my father.
Thank you, sir.
Good night, Pompey. 
That’s what I thought too, sir.
If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads.
Thank you kindly, sir.
Well, if you were never at court, you were never exposed to good manners; if you never witnessed good manners, your manners must be wicked; wickedness is a sin, and committing sins leads to damnation.
If it’s that important, then let the women die.
He goes forth to war bravely.
Cheer up, good Adam.
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else.
That will kill our lovers.
What does this mean?
I’ll invite the duke and all of his followers.
If you say that, you bastard, you’ll kill your Queen.
Here comes the king, the queen, and the noblemen of court.
Look how cheerful my mother is, only two hours after my father died.
And did you leave him like this?
Our hour is up.
Then he’ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch.
He’s an admirable man.
Then I’ll tell you.
But she is wise.
To die, to sleep—to sleep, maybe to dream.
Take out your sword and come on.
So, there’s the signal to ride.
Actors can’t keep a secret.
Please, tell me your cure.
Oh, control yourself, lady!
In order to flatter Caesar, would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants?
Is she dead, then?
Whip him, fellows, until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy!
That’s right, or drinking, swearing, fist-fighting, visiting prostitutes—that kind of thing.
Heart, for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined.
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison?
They call this “the argumentative countercheck.” And so on through “the circumstantial lie” and “the direct lie.” And how many times did you say his beard wasn’t cut well?
I’m telling you, Aliena, I can’t stand being apart from Orlando.
Oh, he hasn’t?
Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you.
Damn it, show me what you’re going to do for her.
Oh, that’s a good wish!
Shall I stay in this dreary world, which is no better than a pigsty without you?
Shall I include hell as well?
Right.
Then turn your noble face away from me, that face that the whole world adores.
My plans take me a roundabout way.
I’ll leave you, lady.
The business you began here needs you as well—especially the business with Cleopatra, which only you can attend to.
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw, with these gentlemen as witnesses.
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him.
Me too.
Right away, Caesar.
I knew you’d turn out this way.
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do, you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena.
You’re not going, sir.
But she is now Mark Antony’s wife.
We’ve got it now.—Do you see this, my good fellow?
Think about our situation, then die.
Is the single man lucky, then?
Not even trivial things were left out.
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet.
Aren’t these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues?
Play your flutes!
Good-bye.
Go ahead.
I’m sending you to England on diplomatic business, and Hamlet will go with you.
What’s your name?
I have to leave right away.
I used to love you.
The sentence I’ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable.
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me.
He’s flabby and out of breath.—Here, Hamlet, take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead.
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime?
Let me go, gentlemen.
I didn’t think I would ever fight Pompey.
Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little.
You’ll be back at two o'clock?
Then learn this from me: if you have something, you have it.
I swear by my sword— Swear by your shield, too!
He loves them both.
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say.
There goes a strong fellow, Menas.
I hope to God I’m wrong about your chances.
A lot of words.
If he can manage to walk after our fight, I’ll never wrestle for money again.
My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed.  
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast—for only twelve people!
While he was alive, I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies.
Welcome.
Remove your armor, Eros.
Just notice.
You are nothing like Mark Antony!
It’s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy.
You’re right, Charmian.
Too late, good Diomedes.
I’d rather die in a ditch in Egypt, and make it my gentle grave.
Or it’s bottomless, at least: pour affection in one end, and it runs out the other.
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome — The actors have arrived, my lord.
Oh, good old man, you’re a great example of that old work ethic, where people worked because it was their duty, not just for the money.
There’s more to it than that.—Ganymede!
Does it mean being truthful?
But you’re wrong.
Carry me, good friends, to where Cleopatra is.
Die where you have lived, in my arms.
Believe me, then, that I have special powers.
I’m all right.
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar’s plate when I met you.
You’re talking like some innocent girl who doesn’t understand the ways of the world.
Your superiors.
Do this immediately, and don’t stop searching and interrogating until you’ve brought home these foolish runaways.
Here we’ll shake hands good-bye.
Do you want me to lie, madam?
This used to be a great puzzle, but now I’ve solved it.
With this marriage, all the petty jealousies that now seem huge, and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves, would disappear.
You don’t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that, sir.
Like a mouse caught in my own trap, Osric.
You’re a traveler.
Excuse me.
Did the brothers-in-law leave?
Everything that belongs to them is yours.
God bless you.
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?
Everything may still be all right.
You need not kneel to me.
Forgive me, darling Rosalind.
She has a body, not a life.
Take your time.
I didn’t see them.
Murder has no tongue, but miraculously it still finds a way to speak.
Mister Challenger, the princess wants to speak to you.
No more than a minute?
Be gone!
Madam, I heard her speak.
What would you like to see?
What do you think of this plan?
Pay attention.
Good luck, fair gentleman.
I’ll do everything a younger man could do for you.
I can’t find anyone who saw her leave.
Is your little pearl in there?
Fake, I’m telling you.
Don’t say what you’re thinking, and don’t be too quick to act on what you think.
May you choke on any other sentiments like that!
Stop, brave lady, stop!
God gives you one face, but you paint another on top of it.
Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her.
May I speak, Caesar.
I am.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Or is he on his horse?
No!
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings.
Call that servant back.
A leathermaker will last nine years.
What a king Claudius is!
I have a lot to tell you about them.
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies, while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars.
You’re mistaken.
Tell her we mean her no disrespect.
Servants, take these gentlemen to see Hamlet.
Stop arguing and listen to my plans.
So, are you done?
Sir, I think I saw him last night.
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles.
Why didn’t you say “the swift steps” of time instead of the “lazy foot”?
He’s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes: that’s the way he plays his part.
So much for Fortinbras.
If you want to pick a fight, you’ll have to find a more substantial excuse.
Yes, we’re the privates in her army.
I will.
That’s no way to pray.
I’ve seen you fight and envied your skill.
A man old Frederick, your father, loves.
Oh, damn three times, damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind.
Sure, since beauty’s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin.
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don’t approve of them.
Excuse me, sir?
There it is.
That’ll be fine.
No.
Give me the goblets.
I swear on my life, which I take pretty seriously, even if I am a magician.
Your guardian angel is noble, courageous, significant, and unmatched when Caesar’s not around.
I beg you to continue to be patient.
No.
The duke will drink under this tree.—He’s been looking for you all day, you know.
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village, a married man’s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor’s bare forehead.
You can judge for yourself what I mean.
Let me see—what do you think about falling in love?
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name, and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “for my sake.” Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things.
Leave us.
Luck and Antony separate here and now.
Besides, I don’t like you.
He saved me the trouble: here he comes.
Where are you taking me?
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause.
I’d better not drink now.
No, sir.
It doesn’t matter where, so long as it’s not here.
I have drawn my sword.
Tell her. 
Don’t trust rotten planks.
For you to do it would be good service.
Actually, it’s not so unusual when you think about it.
Was it a man?
She’s Phoebe-ing me.
Damn it!
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor.
This is that time.
The Queen is here, my lord.
Take off my armor.
It’s true.
Pretty, Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her, smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans, which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them, undoing what they did.
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar?
Whip him!
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen; at eighty, it’s a bit late.
Good night to you.
Here come two of Duke Senior’s pages.
Yes, yes.
God will free you from blame.
Come here.
And earth!
Yes, one, and this is how I did it.
What fate is that?
I’d like to know.
Lock him in, so he can play the fool in his own home only.
Where’s Antony?
Oh, my poor Rosalind, where will you go?
You’re right.
Will you do that for me, Silvius?
It should work.
But where will we go?
Sure, and twenty others just like you.
You’re sure full of smooth answers.
I am satisfied.
Farewell, farewell.
My father’s ghost—armed!
How are you, Hamlet?
I will, Caesar.
Let’s go back to court together, but 
Come on, you can go.
You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around.
Come here.
Oh Lord, my spirits are tired!
My good lord— You’ve always been a liar.
But still, my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea.
Hurry.—Oh, love, if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft.
Goodbye.
Go and put on your own armor.
Tomorrow is the day.
Oh, my brave Emperor, this is what I call a fight!
Your wife and brother led troops against me, claiming to be fighting in your name.
My lord, His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he’s placed a large bet on you.
He’s dreaming.
Since you asked, I suppose it’s not bragging to say that we are.
I’ll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him.
He’s staying in the forest with your father now.
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me, like Egyptian puppets.
If you ever loved your poor dear father— Oh God!
Where have you been, my bravery?
Why are you doing this?
Hello, sir.
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome.
Drowned?
What do you mean, “in a strange way”?
What news, man?
It’s true I’m not married, Caesar.
I don’t really understand what you mean.
There’s something downright unnatural about it, if a philosopher stopped to think about it.
Yes, exactly.
Something about Hamlet.
So you’ve dared him to single combat.
Well then, here’s more money for you.
That’s true, sir.
Then lay that sentence on me too, my lord.
May God be at your table.
I have to go to England, don’t you know that?
Dolabella!
Well, then, what should we do for fun instead?
They got what they deserved.
It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it.
I don’t trust you.
She’s weak and will die unless you comfort her.
He’s at home, my lord.
Right now; as fast as she can say the vows.
Are you his brother?
Isn’t there any other rite you can perform?
Come, driver!
Since she would love both of you, you two would be joined in that love.
It looks like you’ve offended it.
Oh God—who is, by the way, the best comic of them all.
Whenever a king sighs, everyone groans.
Your crown is crooked.
Quiet, you stupid fool.
But Caesar ignores offers that don’t give him an advantage, and so should you.
Don’t think I’m in love with him just because I’m asking about him.
It’s easy to err when left to our own devices, but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them.
Queen of Egypt, greetings!
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress.
Well, the tree bears rotten fruit.
Is there anything offensive in it?
Do you want to know what I wrote?
If we walk on the well-worn paths, they won’t get caught in our petticoats.
Stay hidden and listen.
Let’s go gather our jewels and money.
You worthless man!
That’s him.
A little before twelve, I think.
His legs aren’t great, but they’re alright.
What’s the matter with you, madam?
What time is it?
Sorry, sir?
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them.
So be it, Dolabella.
Referee!
Soon enough.
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again.
Play me some music.
Go on, master, and I will follow you—with truth and loyalty to my last breath.
We want Antony taken alive.
He was an admirable king.
Take a good look, and you’ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore’s jester.
The empire may be in danger if he’s not restrained before he reaches his full potential.
What is it, Laertes?
We did, my lord, weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer.
I know you’re my oldest brother, and deserve more respect.
Twenty-five, sir.
By Hercules, I think I’m right.
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Antony, it’s time to stop your wild hedonism.
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them.
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year, or get out off my land.
Be calm!
Round enough to be unattractive.
Good madam, restrain yourself.
Isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel?
It’s a good thing he’s here to recommend himself.
Why not?
I hope not.
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent.
Do you want to know who they are, then?
Oh, my son, what issue is that?
Isn’t it past two o'clock?
So you’d better not stay with him, Antony.
I’ll get it from you, I swear.
Yes, my lord.
Sir, the king— Yes, what about him?
That won’t work, since I’m still reaping the rewards of that murder: my crown and my queen.
Excellently, excellently.
I’ll be good, sir.
Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring.
When he’s there next time, I’ll send my daughter to see him.
Well, you can go now.
What does she want?
I knew from the first it would be this way.
Many people have told me so.
No, it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you’ve run out of things to say.
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms.
Go on.
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia.
Me too, I won’t, I swear to God.
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance.
Come, and you can have a queen.
Eros, send his treasure to him.
He had his helmet visor up.
If he shows up tomorrow, I’ll give him what’s coming to him.
We’ll hurry.
Farewell.
With half the world opposing the other half, it wasn’t the time for Antony, the pivotal player, to let love distract him.
Come on, let’s go see the king.
His most horrible murder.
God bless you, sir.
Will we be separated?
Besides, he brings his fate with him.
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you, just consider it a big flirtation, the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth.
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her.
I’ll straighten it, then play— Where’s the Queen?
Come on, I won’t stand for it anymore.
Will you come?
Come forward and speak.
No, I’ll go find some ditch to die in.
But what’s the upshot of her admiration?
What is there left to do?
My lord, he will swear on his life that I haven’t kept a thing.—Tell the truth, Seleucus.
A thing of no importance.
Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity, but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin, and why your tomb,
It’s a good thing for you that, being castrated, you can better concentrate on my needs.
Do my simple features please you?
It means being filled with fantasy; with passion and wishes; with adoration, loyalty, and devotion.
No, he has only a little beard.
For the love of God, be patient with him.
Without doubt I’ve heard that.
I don’t want to play now.
Let’s meet as little as we can.
Let’s go.
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats.  
There I’ll see only myself.
Pray God does some surgery on you: you need to be fixed.
Remember me.
Yes, now I’m in Arden, and that makes me the bigger fool.
Your head, my lord?
Don’t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep?
Yes, sir.
If my lips had the power to give life, I would wear them out like this.
This speech is going on too long.
But when you are with him, your angel is weakened and easily frightened.
Do you have unusual snakes there?
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony.
Ah, revenge!
Let me talk, good lady.
You can have a whole story, not just a word.
If not, I’ll leave you alone and that’ll be the end of my business.
You’ll get there two days before me.
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods’ orders in favor of yours.
Just as the ox has his yoke, the horse its bridle, the falcon a tether, a man has his desires—to keep in check.
Remorseless, treacherous, sex-obsessed, unnatural villain!
He’ll find out soon what happened in England.
Give our officers notice of our intentions.
You’re going to rest while you’re still damned?
Write to him from me—I’ll sign it—sending greetings and gentle good-byes.
That’s what he says.
A simple country farmer who brought her figs.
That’s definitely true, my lord.
Don’t believe any of us.
Good friend,” he said, “say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster’s treasure to the great Queen of Egypt, and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire.
Thanks for your company but, really, I would have preferred being alone.
Usually that means a person is foolish.
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city?
I’ll be right here, silent.
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves?
Is that true?
She shall be buried next to her Antony.
For Hecuba!
He’s married to Octavia, madam.
He’s offered me a lot of affection lately.
But you’re no such man.
Pompey has a strong navy.
Is Horatio here too?
A woman who doesn’t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband’s fault is hardly a woman.
Yes, sir.
Hurry to a convent.
Don’t let him leave out the color of her hair.
We’ll chase ’em into their latrines.
In the time since he left Egypt, he could have traveled an even longer distance.
Live in the moment.
But regarding what happened between us, don’t ask—I can’t tell you.
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him?
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops.
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me.
make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills.
Sweetheart, go on.
As long as I’m alive, I’ll be here.
Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all?
Come on, take control of your feelings.
Meet with the ambassadors.
I’ll drink to Hamlet’s health, and into his goblet I’ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings.
No, no, put your hat back on.
Here comes Sir Oliver.
Since the youth won’t be reasoned with, he’ll have to suffer for his stubbornness.
I want to drink your health.
Then we’ll see that tomorrow night.
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles, your hat flying off your head, your sleeves unbuttoned, your shoes untied, and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery.
Besides, his cottage, his flocks, and his grazing rights are on sale now, and since he’s not there, there’s nothing to eat at our house.
There’s been a whole debate on the topic.
Just give me a moment, please—only a moment.
If he becomes pale, I know what to do.
Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person.
Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused.
Oh yes, I heard them all, and more, too.
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements, as great as they are, and lessens our reputations.
Well, I cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face, but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage. 
Cry, “whoa!” to your tongue, please.
I wish they’d fight in fire or in the air.
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me, but I’ll take you, Orlando, to be my husband.
We’ll get married at some point, Audrey.
You’d better understand that I won’t wait till I’m chained up in your master’s court, and I won’t let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia.
My  Will you come on, cousin?
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them.
You look happier already, and I’ll be back quickly.
Where is he?
I’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance.
Good-bye.
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story.—Good old man, you are as welcome here as your master is.
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you.
To me it looks like a weasel.
For the sake of your father’s memory, make peace.
Not until you pass out.
My uncle?
Come, warble for me.
But he’s sleeping.
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants, obeying my commands.
Come here, Proculeius.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than you’ve even dreamed of.
What are these warlike noises?
Go get Aliena ready—because, look, here comes my Rosalind.
Good.
We’ll all want our fortune told.
I’ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France.
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven.
In what sense, my lord?
I can’t admit that, since you’d have to compare his excellence to mine.
My name is Proculeius.
You’d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of  I knew it!
Why do people love you?
In Sicyon.
Hurry up, Audrey, hurry.—I’m coming, I’m coming.
Let’s move again, my friends.
See that it is done, and prepare a feast for the soldiers.
Lady!
Even if we fail at that, we can still fight him on land.
I can’t speak anymore.
Good-bye.
If he’s not around, bring his brother Oliver to me.
Oh, just lies, sir.
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge, his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved.
You won’t enjoy it much, I can tell you, the odds are so against this young man.
Caesar’s sister is named Octavia.
And isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat?
But my personal motivation—and that which should move you most to sanction my departure—is that Fulvia is dead.
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness.
Hang on a minute—who are you?
Perhaps  What, my love?
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown.
Have you seen my lord?
There’s my hat!
Swear by my sword you’ll never mention what you’ve heard.
I’m sorry, you were saying?
I think I hear them.
Hey, what’s this, Adam?
How are you, Charmian?
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
Take your cues from my own despair.
Yes, what about him?
Your praise has beaten you home.
That’s what I hear.
With any luck, the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind.
Oh, unfaithful lover!
If that is not granted, he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens.
Say what you’re here for.
Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave.
Maybe it’ll come again.
I’m more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane.
Thank you, and God bless you for your hospitality.
That tree could be called God’s tree, since it drops such wonderful fruit.
I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again.
You are in a perilous state, shepherd.
Do you remember the circumstances?
No, lady.
It’s locked away in my memory, and you’ve got the key.
All right, stop this.
No, if you’re ever late like this again, I’ll refuse to see you.
Yes, my lord.
Which one of you killed the deer?
Here on her breast there’s a little bloody mark.
The king, the king’s to blame.
Well, it’s a fault I wouldn’t trade for your best virtue.
It may be honest, but it’s never wise to bring bad news.
Please, tell us.
Caesar has sent— Too slow a messenger.
If I know my own thoughts and desires, and I’m not dreaming or crazy—which I’m sure I’m not—then, dear uncle, I’ve never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you.
Or is he walking?
Should I strike it with my spear?
Is he married to Cleopatra?
Let me love him because he deserves it, and you can love him because I do.
And then he’ll … he’ll … wait, what was I about to say?
Is that his answer?
No.
Big, round tears ran piteously down the animal’s innocent nose.
If it’s okay with you, you should not press your grievances any further, but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you.
Go to your tomb!
We’ll leave you here. 
Hamlet, you’re dead.
Follow my mother.
No, madam.
Sir, we’ll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye.
I don’t want to hear you sing.
But this is a sure thing: the snake’s an odd snake.
A man with a wife like that might ask, “Hey, wandering wit, where are you off to?” Nah, better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed.
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn’t know what passion was.
Quiet, quiet!
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut.
Caesar, I’m telling you that Antony is dead.
Then we’ll be stuffed with news.
Yes, my lord.
I’ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain; more fond of new things than an ape; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey.
So do all thoughts.
Speak plainly.
That’s what Fulvia told me.
Come on, my lord.
If you could please stop fooling around, I’ll tell you what your mother wants.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire—from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother!
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed, and they match the fencing accessories.
But please, tell him how well I faked a faint.
Sir, these accusations should be answered.
Because he’s daring us to do it.
No, come on, one more time.
Thanks, my dear lord.
I tell you, Charles, he’s the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other people’s good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother.
Isn’t that enough?
I doubt it’s anything but the obvious reason: his father’s dying and our quick marriage.
I wish you’d be patient.
Come on, sister.
Flee?
Will you marry us here, under this tree, or should we follow you to your chapel?
Hello, sir.
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury.
Who is to blame for this: Antony or I?
So, good-bye.
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with.
Is it all come to this?
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world, carrying the name of Rosalind.
If I had known this young man was his son, I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight.
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me?
Not a second more.
You have my consent.
He calls me “boy” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt.
But yet, madam— I don’t like the sound of “but yet.” It reverses all the good that came before it.
I’ll never see the likes of him again.
Silvius, keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me.
No one else would.
As for me, I welcome my good luck with sadness.
I was not myself, as a result of the wine.
They’re all dead.
Now, I’ll swear to the opposite—that the pancakes were rotten, and the mustard was fine—but even so, the knight wasn’t lying.
Where do you live, pretty young man?
I’ll do my best, madam.
Are you kidding?
Farewell, my lord.
Call me the worst liar?
By God!
Good morning, sir.
Let Rome fall!
I had my father’s signet ring in my pocket, with the royal seal of Denmark on it.
So how did it go, sir?
Where’s my notebook?—It’s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile, and be a villain.
That’s our offer.
I will not live to hear the news from England.
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence  I’ll write “Rosalinda,” Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman.
Stop fooling around.
He’s calling us back.
The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.
Please, my friend, give me all the news, both good and bad, at the same time.
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar.
Is that the man?
Let’s speak to him.
Good-bye.
And I’ve been avoiding him all day.
There’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “Rosalind” on their barks.
So why did you laugh when I said that men don’t interest me?
Enough of this frivolous talk.
As long as that?
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical.
Murder?
Noble Antony, even illness couldn’t keep me away.
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey.
God bless you.
You’ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue.
Spoken like a gentleman.
We won’t, sir.
Repent and avoid damnation.
He’s his homeland’s jewel.
What’s the news!
You dance and prance and lisp; you call God’s creations by pet names, and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance.
Has your heart cooled toward me?
I overheard him and his plans.
I’m very sorry I was so hard on him.
Our leader is being led.
Good-bye.
Pompey, you cannot frighten us with your navy.
I played Julius Caesar.
I’ll change that name for you.
And to me, Denmark is a prison.
My sword and I will earn our place in history.
I don’t understand—how should I answer that?
Oh, to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall!
And now, my friends, my courageous and educated friends, do me one small favor.
We beg you, for your own sake, to respect your safety and give up.
Leave her to God and her own guilt.
When a great person departs, it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body.
Hurry.
Come with me.
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
Leave now.
Yes, my lord.
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest.
I don’t care.
Do you doubt I’ll write?
Well that’s good.
He may recover yet.
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value, but now I know her.
Oh, eastern star!
He was perfect in everything.
We’ve been betrayed!
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern.
Should we part, sweet girl?
Please just listen.
Shall we go watch this wrestling, cousin?
Lepidus flatters both of them, as they flatter him, but he doesn’t love them, and they don’t love him.
In heaven.
And when that time comes, then you can mock me, but please don’t pity me, because I won’t pity you.  
It looks that way.
What, don’t courtiers' hands sweat?
That’s true, my lord.
By God, I order you to speak.
You may do whatever you want in the world.
Please, don’t be sad, and don’t tell me how reluctant you are.
From the time I was seventeen, over sixty years ago, I have lived in this house, but now I will live here no more.
What an ass I am.
Here comes the Emperor.
This strong poison’s overpowering me.
It’s driven me crazy.
Oh, with his sordid desertion, he sets the example for our own.
People who die of it seldom or never recover.
How low we can fall, Horatio.
Your son is crazy.
May the gods bless Antony today!
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter: I have never in my life loved my brother.
Think about it.
Take away this lout and whip him.
Dying, sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for.
The original story was written in the finest Italian.
Good morning, General.
I’ve seen both of you fence.
Alexas!
It’s Orlando, who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant.
I’ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime.
Large and increasing.
From what, in God’s name?
Will they stop working when their voices mature?
Call him.
What’s this part for?
Get out, insolent eunuch!
Yes, my lord, if you give us permission.
What does this mean?
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation.
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions.
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone.
No, my friends, don’t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well.
This hasn’t reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet.
Well, then, I thank you, though I’m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much.
But now I’ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me.
Please, Horatio, go with him.  
I’ll scratch out your eyes, even if they could fly.
What’s up, daughter and niece?
If you can’t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do, you haven’t loved.
No, I had to do something.
Fine, thank you.
What should I call you when you’re a man?
Friends, go.
Just as bad, my lord.
Should we go inside?
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man.
Dolabella.
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son?
But tell me, monsieur—what sport are the ladies missing?
You’re in a good mood tonight, my lord.
He’s an important person.
Cheer up!
But no matter—I’ll get back at him soon enough.
Come on.
He’s right over there.
There aren’t three people in all of Egypt who could do better.
I insist, don’t be more distressed than I am.
That’s the next thing on the agenda.
Everyone join hands.
If we welcome our punishment, we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly.
Isn’t that him heading this way?
How are you, my ladies?
Well, time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal.
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him.
You think so?
My lord!
That’s the right answer—it shows your love.
Who’s calling?
A thin face, which you don’t have; a sleepless, sunken eye, which you don’t have; an irritable temper, which you don’t have; a neglected beard, which you don’t have—but that might not be so telling, since you don’t have much beard anyway.
Many people faint when they see blood.
Never mind.
I will catch up with you, Cleopatra, and weep for your forgiveness.
What part of the agreement did I break?
I’ll do that, because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him, Rosalind.
Enough of this.
And we will raise your wages.
Oh-ho-ho, kid!
You will love more than you are loved.
Good grief, do you think that just because I’m dressed like a man, I have a man’s patience?
I’d like to sing my song solo.
My honor wasn’t given; it was only dominated.
Caesar, you thought this would happen.
Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!
But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about.
The gods forbid!
You sell fish.
And I for Rosalind.
Good-bye.
Where, sir?
No more talk about my father; you’ll be whipped for slander one of these days.
Go, get out!
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest, who can tell you what marriage is all about, marry you.
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities.
By my faith in love, I will, then.
That’s why there must be space between you. 
If you weren’t my brother, I’d leave this hand of mine on your neck until I’d pulled out your tongue for talking like this.
Yet he seems capable.
Come on, sir.
The people have heard it already, and they’ve been told of his accusations.
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke’s favorite champion?
You’ve done well at sea.
Put on my crown.
She’s a remarkable lady, if the rumors are to be believed.
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play.
I’ll speak to him now.
Stay!
But what danger we’ll put ourselves in, two young, innocent women traveling so far!
We’ll go together, and before we’ve spent all the savings of your youth, we’ll find a way to make a living.
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep.
Follow that gentleman now, and be careful not to make fun of him.
I don’t even have one to throw at a dog.
How literal this guy is!
Oh, listen to me, night— Who is this?
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment, or nothing at all.
She gave up her life with your name still within her.
You’re too forgiving.
Sadness and despair!
Pardon me?
No, it wasn’t.
You will always be welcome to me. 
Speak softly.
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul, and the rest of the world shared my father’s opinion.
It was obviously a hit.
If knives, poison, or snakes have edge, effect, or venom, I am safe from that fate.
Say the last word I spoke was “Antony,” and please word it pathetically.
How tall is she?
Dreams are a sign of ambition, since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream.
I’m sorry to have to say this— Help me away from here, dear Charmian!
Is it possible?
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct, as much as any strong emotion.
I don’t dare come down—forgive me, my lord—I don’t dare, for fear of capture.
Oh, noble weakness!
The container of that great soul is now cold.
If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her.
Whether you are sad or merry, the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .
Good-bye, noble Agrippa.
And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you.
Let me shake your hand.
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she’s out of the picture.
Bring ink and paper, Charmian.
I hope you are pleased with the snake.
But we’ll obey.
Now go and get me some booze.
You call this sneering?
Come on, noble captain.
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed.
Go on.
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions.
Antony” was divided between her heart and lips.
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father, you shouldn’t try to teach me how to be happy.
You look like a person who knows the business of war.
You’re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop.
If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, goodbye, love.
What can I do for your highness?
No, he’s not.
I’ll be back here with you by two o'clock.
Close, soft eyes.
Oh, madam, madam, madam!
What can we do to find out if it’s true?
Cheer yourself.
Let’s stay and watch a while.
I’ll do well.
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece, and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake.
Young man, have you challenged Charles the Wrestler?
I’m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other.
Listen to what the tyrant says.
She’s full of good advice.
My beautiful Rosalind, I’m only an hour late.
Oh, darling Phoebe, if you ever fall in love with some fresh face, then you’ll know about the invisible wounds that love’s sharp arrows can make.
My heart feels like it’s about to explode.
How goes the battle?
Yes, but how he adores Mark Antony!
We’ll meet you at sea.
By the moon and stars!
No more than that, my lord.
Don’t let her say I kept you.
Thank you.
But I don’t hate Orlando.
What do you mean by that?
Do it.
I won’t stay behind.
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer.
It’s good we had this meeting.
Even innocents cannot always escape disaster.
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act.
Gertrude, he says he’s found out the reason for your son’s insanity.
In this world, I’m only taking up space.
What else can I say?
Yes, revered Queen.
Oh, dear God, please help him!
Look who’s coming.
I have responsibilities in this war, and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man.
Well, there they are.
There’s Dolabella, who was sent from Caesar.
It’s too bad that Antony’s fault should make you look like a jerk.
I wouldn’t allow your enemies to say that, and I won’t believe it from you.
Oh!
Where are you, Death?
Oh-ho-ho, sir!
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt.
Excellent in fencing, I mean, sir.
I assure your majesty I’m only doing my duty both to my God and my good king. 
Let’s go find that hussy, Fortune, and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally.
There are only friends here.
Is there anyone to give the bride away?
May the gods destroy you!
Welcome, welcome to all of you.
The East is very seductive.
It wants us to speak to it.
I’m indebted to you.
Speak confidently.
After you harvest, you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart.
My lord, what are you talking about?
Come, everyone.
I wish I’d been there.
Excellent, very good.
Don’t joke about this, Enobarbus.
What’s the matter?
The thing is definitely going to be sold.
I don’t want to take another man’s second-hand goods.
I’m watching the play.
They made more money and got more attention in the city.
Farewell, lady.
What, aren’t you a Christian?
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Which he quickly allowed, given that you’re an obstacle to his lust.
Well, I think it’s good to be serious and keep quiet.
There’s a farmer here who won’t leave without seeing your Highness.
I would have met you by sea and again by land.
Yes, my lord.
I don’t see any blood.
I’ll take no lesser name than that of  Something that refers to my current state.
Oh, Antony!
Let’s not fight over this fellow.
Besides, our hands are hard and calloused.
Swear by my sword.
And you’ve done well on land.
What a tunneler!
I’m happy to say “amen” to that!
Let’s take up the best positions we can in the valleys.
Who deserted this morning?
I am sick and sullen.
He only married out of political necessity.
So go ahead and cry.
We will, my lord.
Then we won’t agree to his demands.
Let’s follow them.
A virtuous woman won’t give her husband horns, and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous.
What color, madam?
Wouldn’t it be better—since I’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man?
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you.
Proculeius, Caesar has heard about what you’ve done here and has sent for you.
I’ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle, making your pain linger.
I mean, what sort of man is he?
Pompey is making the most of our absence. 
But don’t expect any more than that.
Got it, sir.
Bring me his answers quickly.
I’m glad to see you go.
Go, Mardian, and let me know how he reacts to my death. 
Now, Death, you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession.
Yes, sir.
I’ll be at your service.
Don’t worry, I won’t.
But how?
Yes, sweet Rosalind.
I remember he’s already occupied.
Come with me and I’ll get it for you.
I’ll scalp you.
If I’m killed, it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead.
I want to measure the extent of your love, to see how far it stretches.
Good-bye, son.
You’re a man?
Come with me.
If you stop up the keyhole, it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke.
Oh, sir, someone would think I was a good fake.
Will you come with us?
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him.
I know what you’d do.
He stayed like that a long time.
Sit between us.
I have bankrupted three tailors.
Never contradict him.
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here, you come with me, and even though I leave here, I stay with you.
It may be, it certainly may be.
Please avoid doing that.
No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs.
Good-bye.
I’ll lie down here and measure out my grave.
Go on.
All right, then.
The clock’s just striking twelve.
I didn’t hear it.
Phoebe wrote it.
Then you would have to go beyond heaven, beyond earth.
Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives.
Just as Antony loves.
You couldn’t beat the two of them apart.
The drink, the drink!
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind?
Well, I’m sorry for you, gentle Silvius.
The less they deserve, the more your generosity is worth.
You should mock me    I wish I were invisible, so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg.
You must understand, Silius, that it’s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior’s absence.
Did he treat you well when you saw him?
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand.
You get only one round.
I think he must have turned into an animal, because I can’t find him anywhere looking like a man.
You’re making fun of me.
Why, that’s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions.
Therefore, tremble with fear and leave.
Even if marrying her meant I died.
Listen to me.
Do you get what I’m saying, Reynaldo?
What is logical, then, my lord?
Don’t talk to me.
You didn’t arrive like Caesar’s sister.
So cheer up.
Tell me that I’ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them.
Please forgive me as I forgive you, Hamlet.
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him?
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes, brought her here.
Look—his noble blood is still on it.
You call that ranting?  
His imagination is making him crazy.
Oh, heavenly mixture!
Well, aren’t you a good man?
Come on, music!
Welcome, my good friends.
Anger does not protect the angry well.
So you want to put a man in your belly.
No, you were one of Gneius Pompey’s leftovers—not to mention your other, more depraved affairs, which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip.
Some of those lines had more feet than the  That’s not a problem: the feet can bear Sure, but these feet were 
Well then, if I’ve ever thanked a man, I’ll thank you now.
I’ve heard a lot more.
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar.
Eros, can you still see me?
And I swear by my wickedness (if I had any) that I am a knave.
Wasn’t he here?
You can give good news in many ways, but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it.
My mind is confused.
What is it, Octavia?
I know you can do better than that, but it’ll do for now.
He’s got my vote as I die.
Good morning to you.
Or like a whale.
Please, if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man, buy the cottage, pasture, and flock for us, and we’ll pay you for it.
What, does your wife say you can come home?
What does that mean, sir?
What did he tell you, Ophelia?
Separate them.
If he will grant me conquered Egypt, so that I may give it to my son, I will kneel to him with thanks.
You’ll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so.
My lord, if you have a free moment, I have a message from His Majesty.
Of what 
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth.
What did I keep for myself?
Now he’ll work himself up to a fury.
He looks angry.
Help me, angels!
I’ll limp after you.
His lips were nice and red, a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks—one was pure red and the other more pink.
I wouldn’t care about my spirits, if my legs weren’t tired.
As good a reason as any.
And, my dear sister, as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing, let me hear from you—write.
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory.
I’m dying for food, so let me have some.
I will, in other words, kill you in three hundred and fifty ways.
Good madam, let me speak.
Gracious Queen, even Herod of Judea wouldn’t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood.
The muffled queen” is good.
Do you hear that, Charmian?
Didn’t I buckle this well?
No, someone has to give her away or the marriage isn’t legal.
My Italy is full of civil war.
Even her worst faults are charming, and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut.
Look, here comes the duke.
Clink your cups together in a toast!
Hello, sir.
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave?
By Jupiter, if I were Antony, I wouldn’t shave my beard today.
Give him the goblet.
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway.
Well, it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church.
Exactly like that.
You’re naughty.
And when you want to go to sleep, I’ll be up laughing like a hyena.
Neither can my accomplishments at sea.
How did they die?
We’ll win yet.
Crude slaves with greasy aprons, rulers, and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see.
Good-bye.
This is all that’s left for me to do, but I won’t do it.
So then the Poles won’t be willing to defend it.
Are you talking about Caesar?
But really, are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind?
She’ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her.
The last thing he did before sending me off, dear Queen, was to kiss—the last of many such kisses—this Indian pearl for you.
Welcome to Elsinore.
Oh, Isis, that’s impossible.
Take your seat.
Why, what’s the danger?
Well, let’s sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us.
I’m saying it to the girl who isn’t here and doesn’t hear me.
Quiet!
My God, do you think I’m easier to manipulate than a pipe?
Good-bye, kind Charmian.
You’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago’s wife.
But let him come.
Where will the old duke live?
Here’s to your health.
I hope it works out for the best, Lepidus.
You are your father’s daughter.
His faults were equally matched by his virtues.
Now I’ve paid you back, Parthia, and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus’ death.
But you heard him swear up and down that he was.
He was dressed like a hunter.
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor.
Terrible.
But you don’t look as if you bring good news.
May my wrinkles forbid that!
Indeed, my lord, the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths.
Although you deserve praise, applause, and love, right now the duke misconstrues everything you’ve done.
As far as I’m concerned, what’s past is done.
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness, Hamlet. 
If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you.
Good-bye.
He sent me word that, whether I liked it or not, he liked it fine.
Cleopatra, our conquest won’t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed.
I’ve gotten it dirty—ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit.
He’s afraid to come in.
I loved one speech in particular.
Eros, would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar’s victory parade, his arms crossed and tied, his head bowed in submission, his face red from shame, while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him, putting the final stamp to his humiliation?
I’ll wait on them with all respect and duty.
Are you sad about that?
Hello and God bless you, sir.
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected.
Me neither.
I’ll tell him all of this, dear lady.
I’ll flatter anyone who flatters me—though what I’ve accomplished on land cannot be denied.
I’d rather be wooed by a snail.
Don’t give him time to catch his breath.
Here I lie and will never get up again.
Think about it.
More, please, more.
The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music.
Really, the priest was good enough, no matter what that old guy said.
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat.
And you can’t put your heads together and figure out why he’s acting so dazed and confused, ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy?
Let’s follow him.
Seleucus’ ingratitude makes me wild.
He’s like a cowardly 
There isn’t much time.
Enjoy your frankness; it suits you.
This is a horrible sight.
She is not, madam.
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave.
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others.
How old is she?
Wake up, sir, wake up.
Yes, better than you know me.
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture?
Do you have desires?
Where’s Antony now?
Even if you were as handsome as  I beg your highness’ pardon.
Go hide, Adam, and you’ll hear how he abuses me.
I like him very well.
Well sir, good night.
Should we just get down to it?
I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword on a stone, and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile.
Isn’t he the one who’s always,” and so on.
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage, I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it.
But never mind.
Look, it’s going away.
Yes, very much like a whale.
Tell him to surrender.
Come on, you keep getting paler.
A cat in heat will look for a mate, And Rosalind certainly will too.
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city?
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold: he was neither sad nor happy.
Every one of us is a criminal.
You can’t stay here any longer.
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind, made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water.
That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market.
It is well done, and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings.
Oh, you villain, villain, you damned, smiling villain!
Exactly.
So you’re around Lady Luck’s waist?
Really, Audrey, I wish you were more poetical.
More, please, more.
Go get my best clothes.
I’ll hire you again to go back to Rome.
No, come to my cabin.
I was killed in the Capitol.
Do you lie still?
Take him away.
Don’t speak of this again.
Finally, after shaking my arm a little, and jerking his head up and down three times, he sighed like it was his last breath.
I will.
I’ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt.
His military ability is double that of the other two.
He’s afraid to come in.
Please, be cheerful.
She had a premonition of what has actually happened.
Hey out there!
Promising favors?
What, you look amused.
You’re not going anywhere.
You are about as much of a thinker as worm’s meat is a nice steak.
Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, I’d hate to crush him—though I’d have to, if he challenged me.
Oh, has it come to this?
You’ve said it, friend, and farewell to you.
Caesar?
Wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate?
He’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain, every little object goes down with it.
In that case it’s good to be a post.
Then where would you have me go, Adam?
You get my point, don’t you?
Many people, men and women alike.
Oh, to think you’ve been rejected!
She has a low-pitched voice.
How are you, sir?
Yes, I’ll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there.
Start without me.
Sir, he’s with Caesar.
Most noble Antony!” Then, as she was speaking your name, a strangled groan split her words.
But I don’t worry about being deceived because I don’t need to trust.
He’s given his empire to a whore, and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war.
Why would they do that, my lord?
I’d do it myself, but I can’t leave my post.
Well, give me the worst news.
We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly.
I don’t remember.
I watched him very closely.
Yes, you poor ghost, as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head.
Farewell, sir.
You’re taking a shorter route.
It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough.                      
It is that.
Oh, ho!
Farewell.
I’m going to make you look sharp, Laertes.
You should ask me what time of day it is, instead.
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
Good idea.
Not us.
No, you have to call me Rosalind.—Sister, you’re coming?
They said they were acting for you.
They say they have letters for you.
Sir, sir, that can’t be true.
Don’t push him too far.
So-so” is good, very good, an excellent answer.
What’s the news?
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself.
Where’s Seleucus?
Go ahead, then.
Soldier, you are.
Is she as tall as I am?
Here, I give you my blessing again.
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman, you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand.
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune.
Don’t think I blame you.
Come here, sir.
I didn’t say free, madam.
Who does time amble for?
It’s fair game to mark a coward.
I mean, what do the words say?
He swears he used to be a courtier.
I pulled it from his wound.
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease.
I saw that.
Be careful not to fall in.
Oh, a thousand of them, all of which I’ve forgotten.
Have you forgotten who I am?
If you leave like that, you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good-bye. 
Pardon me, but I’m just repeating what you yourself have said.
I wish the night were here already!
Are you considering desertion, as well?
Yes, Celia, we kept her here for your sake.
I’ll do all that.
Please, pretty young man, I’d like to get to know you better.
Learn from the wise, and comprehend: the courtier’s perfume is made from cat discharge—much more disgusting than tar.
No, you won’t die yourself, but only by proxy.
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk?
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son, who’s changed too much.
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands.
Oh, the glory of war has faded.
Not true.
I’ll take the Queen into my custody.
Motley is the only thing to wear.
What kind of work is this, Charmian?
You’re looking for Lord Hamlet.
Young gentleman, you are too bold for your age.
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced?
She is banished.
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights, but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore.
Oh, you evil woman!
You were sent for.
But don’t I have good reason to cry?
Now, Iras, what do you think?
Well, you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time.
Who are you talking to?
Whoever’s a real friend should strike me dead.
This world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love.
But since you come from him, you’re saturated with his healing spirit.
Look, he’s recovering.
I’d rather carry a reed that obviously can’t protect me than a sword I cannot lift.
Well, then, there!
Where’s your father?
I’ll tell you privately.
After midnight, for two nights running, these two guards, Marcellus and Barnardo, saw a figure that looked very much like your father, in full armor from head to toe.
You won’t find any cause for anxiety, even if you look for one.
Its own color.
Do you recognize the handwriting?
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead.
A good name.
The tragic actors from the city, the ones you used to enjoy so much.
Well, that’s a fine answer.
Give me your hand, and explain your situation to me.
Octavia has a pious, chaste, meek disposition.
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them?
That’s not in her favor.
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape.
How could that happen?
I’ve promised to make everything right.
Cut yourself?
Ask this man’s forgiveness, love him, and accept his offer.
And don’t be proud.
In fact, she’s crazed.
If it’s true that you don’t need 
Oh, proud Death, what banquet are you preparing that you’ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke?
Caesar is upset.
Look and see.
That’s not good, and no good can come of it either.
Yes, in a very gentlemanly way.
This isn’t the death of one man.
Come on, sir, will you come aboard?
Where is he now?
Canidius, take our nineteen 
It was worse than being a captive in chains.
No, not me, sir.
How old are you, friend?
Listen.
I’ll fight at sea.
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands.
We’ll put a leash on this danger that’s now running wild.
See, ladies, how they scorn me now.
Not true, not true.
Listen to me, madam.
It means being faithful and ready to serve, just like I am for Phoebe.
And you’re right to do so.
My services are at your command.
I think there must be something invigorating about death, since she dies with such enthusiasm.
If luck deserts us today, it’s because we defy it.
Go relax now.
Besides, you’re a sponge!
Did you hear her speak?
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you, giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us.
Get a little sleep.
Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner?
My lord, Hamlet’s going to his mother’s room.
As king, I cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour.
Don’t speak any further.
Yes, my lord.
No medicine in the world can cure you.
I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared. 
Now I am sure that eyes can’t hurt a person.
I don’t think so.
Stay, Jaques, stay here for a bit.
Very much so.
They are his dung, and he their beetle.
It’s getting there.
Isn’t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword—and an easy conscience?
If our general had been his old self, we would have won.
What do you mean by “carriages”?
By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right?
I’m coming.
Only for poor men?
Where’s Antony?
Come with me and let me advise you.
Then everything must really be finished.
It sure is.
Otherwise, I’ll do it anytime, as long as I’m able.
Why should I stay— In this vile world?
Yes, my lord.
I am arrogant, vengeful, ambitious, with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts, and more than I have time to carry it out in.
Why shouldn’t I be there in person?
I don’t know how.
You’ve probably heard about the “change” that’s come over Hamlet—that’s the only word for it, since inside and out he’s different from what he was before.
Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly.
For God’s sake, let me hear it.
I will, sir.
You’d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour?
Oh well.
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying.
Go on, Caesar.
You speak more wisely than you know.
Yes, it’s William, sir.
And I’m going to sleep.
He’s praying now.
I have no power over you.
But gods, you give us faults so we’ll be human.
Madam, please be patient.
This is the time of night when witches come out, when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out.
Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes.
Soldiers, watch carefully.
What, you dare put your hands on me, villain?
Oh, that devious Egyptian spirit!
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods.
A man named Taurus, they say.
Come with me.
Do you hear us, sir?
These are a man’s words, and his handwriting.
He’s awfully proud, but his pride suits him.
Sir, I have no future ahead of me.
No, after you.
I suspect some foul play.
To race after your departing ships, leaving his navy to watch, was a shame as great as the resulting loss.
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks.
Why do you say that?
Well, then, be brave and pretend to be a man.
Farewell.
Now from head to foot I’m as firm as marble.
Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.” I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage.
Retreat!
Not for a second.
What would you like?
Isn’t it strange?
Oh, how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him.
Take him safely through the lines.
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing, but if it’s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause, then they’re worthless.
I’ll have Herod’s head chopped off!
In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms.
Doesn’t everyone want a wife like that?
Let me be your servant.
I would like to prove to you that I am.
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good, and that the mustard on top of them—he swore on his honor—was bad.
Who does he accuse?
No, he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old.
Winter garments need to be filled with something, And so does skinny Rosalind.
It really is good to see you.
My father’s spirit is growing in me, and I won’t take this any longer.
Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come after us. 
No, dear Queen.
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost.
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage.
After all, who would put up with all life’s humiliations—the abuse from superiors, the insults of arrogant men, the pangs of unrequited love, the inefficiency of the legal system, the rudeness of people in office, and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad—when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits?
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit.
Bring that swinger Orlando here.
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds!
This man looks like his business is urgent.
I’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids!
Let go of it!
For what favor?
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers.
From now on I will, cousin, and I’ll think of all kinds of games for us.
Refusing to fight him at sea won’t disgrace you.
Here’s my hand.
He was somewhere in the middle, between them . . .
Doesn’t it look like the king?
My forces are growing, and everything I know tells me it’s all coming together.
Any villain in Denmark is going to be, well, a villain.
I hope it doesn’t make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman.
What was I saying?
Yes, sir, very well—I’m here in your orchard.
Bring him to me.
Sir, I can’t.
Call out my household servants.
We’ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end—with delight.
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that!
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions.
The weather is fair.
Yes, yes, and let’s sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse.                
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes.
I swear on my life that I’m speaking the truth.
Good night.
I’ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure.
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master.
There’s music coming out of thin air.
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior, especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress.
Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud.
Cleopatra summoned him.
What’s that noise?
May He bless you, too.
If I weren’t a merciful man, I’d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place.
Sir, sir!
Why bother with them?
We’ll watch a whole play tomorrow.
All right, I will.
What?
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra.
Well, that’s certainly out of this world, all right.
This is our station.
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day?
Do you want to exchange fathers?
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune.
Good morning, General.
My God, this is unbelievably strange.
Oh, what evil!
Caesar.
Yes, even power gets in its own way.
Boys, how are you both doing?
Come, this way to the rowboat.
But listen, Charmian.
I do indeed, my lord.
What are you doing here?
Greetings, dearest Caesar!
I’m very glad to see you.
Tonight we’ll have dinner.
Really, cousin, it’s him.
Well, well, well.
You don’t have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
She stood and spoke.
No, let’s follow him.
And yet I feel it’s very hot and humid, which is bad for my complexion.
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot?
Caesar is in a sober mood.
Or if you’ve got some buried treasure somewhere, which they say often makes ghosts restless, then tell us about it.
Then get to work, poison!
I’m telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.
Phoebe, keep your promise to marry me, and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me.
Me, uncle?
Quiet, I say.
Oh, where have you led me, Egypt?
He said my eyes and my hair were black and, now that I think of it, he scorned me.
I still have room for six more wounds.
Let’s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops.
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck.
Well, let’s go on.
Let’s play.
Yes, I see them coming.
How is Hamlet?
So, please, my lord, don’t assume that I’m treacherous just because I’m poor, with no titles to my name.
What right did he have to scold me like that?
I must be gone.
You’re not responsible for my death and my father’s, and I’m not responsible for yours.
He knows that you didn’t embrace Antony because you loved him, but because you feared him.
He was happy here, listening to a song.
I’ll look for some way to leave his service.
Yes, Lepidus.
It’s leaping about like a frisky horse.
Offer yourself more respect, or—not to beat this word to death—you’ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock.
Oh, darling Orlando, it’s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling.
I’m tired of you.
And what is the subject?
If I can find any animal in this wild forest, I’ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you.
Then there must be no lovers in the forest, either, because they’re as good as a clock, marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour.
Show us the way, sir.
I’ll drink it if I like.
The glowworm’s light is beginning to fade, so morning is near.
Find out who did it!
I’m sure I can guess.
And will you have me?
I’ve destroyed my reputation, a most shameful error.
What is it?
Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.
Oh, go, leave me.
Well, that’s just greedy.
Yes, he does.
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love.—Hello, Ophelia.
Until recently, I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean.
Welcome, dear madam.
That’s Enobarbus?
Caesar’s knave will bring him a message for us.
I’m reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew.
Why has all this been put on the table?
Where’s my father?
My gallant girls!
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand, sharp and dipped in poison.
I didn’t write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations.
Ah, dear, if that is true, let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart, and let the first hailstone drop down my throat.
Against my brother Lucius?
Throw some of your words at me.
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes, I can tell you who’d be on the ground.
Quiet!
My dear sir!
If you can’t answer it— Go ahead!
The higher the Nile flows, the better the harvest.
Whatever happens to me, this is a soldier’s kiss.
All is lost!
Here, you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer, drink this.
I’ll make Oliver find him.
The coroner’s inquest law.
Your majesty!
They are here at court now, and I believe they’ve been told to give a performance for him tonight.
Look, it’s waving me over again.
My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing.
The ghost is definitely something to worry about.
It’s time to end it, good lady.
My ear must pull it out.
Fair princess, you’ve missed some good sport.
No, a woman’s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings.
He’s not himself because he feels so ashamed.
Escape and make peace with Caesar.
Follow him, friends.
We have not betrayed you.
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar’s prize.
Very well, thank you.
Come with us, Lepidus.
He was in a good mood, and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome.
Well, we’ve missed the beginning; it’s dead and buried.
But I haven’t eaten anything yet.
Yes.
I’m serious, I can’t.
Good-bye, my lord.
In the fact that it’s solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that it’s private, it’s terrible.
I’m telling you the truth.
When did I  Do you know where you are, sir?
I also hope that we can be better strangers.
Remember you!
What if she won’t kiss me?
And that’s how my brother robbed me of my life, my crown, and my queen all at once.
Mistress, you have to go see your father.
I must join the duke for lunch.
Let’s hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly.
What role did you play?
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me.
No more of this.
But you’re lying out in the cold.
And you,  And how are you liking the shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
But, go on.
And welcome, welcome!
None of us.
I felt like skipping school, sir.
I found them on a tree.
So get ready to leave.
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play, with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy. 
Well, good night.
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow’s udders that her pretty, chapped hands had milked.
Battered armor, be off.
I’ll stop by before you go to bed, and tell you what I’ve heard.
I’m not going to waste any more time with you.
Keep it from leaving, Marcellus.
I should have waited to tell you my news.
But my eyes, which I’ve darted at you, haven’t even left a mark.
If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of 
I won’t speak to her.
I will fight him there.
Yes, he has.
Fulvia?
If I were my father, cousin, would I do this?
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily—and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully, when I had no reason to speak of you at all. 
I’ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say.
What a poor instrument, that can do such a noble deed!
Please, don’t make fun of me.
Good-bye, my dearest sister, good-bye.
Or at least I can describe the rumors.
No, it’s certain, Iras.
And I for no woman.
Charmian, did I ever love Caesar as much as this?
Here comes the noble Antony.
It’s an outstanding army and highly motivated.
Is that Barnardo?
Dead.
I never saw such a shameful act.
Do you?
Yes, I did, my lord.
Damn those words, “but yet!” “But yet” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal.
Will you play this recorder?
And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy.
They finished their business with Pompey, and Pompey has left.
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight.
What do you mean, the seventh cause?
Orlando, my lord, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
It has come again.
He’s waiting outside.
Yes, I’ll go.
If you thought that you’d be thinking too much.
Eros!
Oh, Antony, Antony, Antony!
Look who’s coming: a young man and an old man, having a serious talk.
Be patient.
Good God, I was about to say something.
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs.
Yes, that’s it.
Look, here comes someone who loves me, along with someone who loves her.
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel?
That was one hit.
Did you call for me, your Worship?
Thanks, Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz.
Is her voice pitched high or low?
Your light dulls when he is near.
Friends of this country.
Well then, can’t I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow?
You’ll get some of what you want.
No, no.
Let it be.
Take this!
If that man, who’s made up of conflicts, becomes musical, then there must be something wrong with the universe.
He did ask for mercy.
There we go!
What—is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank?
End it, then, and everything is over.—Eros!—I’m coming, my Queen!—Eros!—Wait for me.
He’ll come right away.
Isn’t that your habit?
Three-time traitor and whore!
That’s the truth, sir.
Armed, sir.
You can’t see the future.
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my daughter.
I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit you’re closer to him and matter more because you’re older.
Then what’s Antony?
And there comes Caesar.    
I’ve relinquished my authority, so please—I’ll see you all before long.
Nature took Helen’s  Cleopatra’s majesty, The best of Atalanta, And unhappy Lucretia’s modesty.
More, more, please, more.
Well, by this I can see that you don’t love me as much as I love you.
Good noble ladies, be brave.
So, may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support.
Oh, please, tell us, sir.
I ask you, if you’ve kept this a secret, keep doing so.
I wish you were someone else’s son.
When courage consumes reason, it destroys its only weapon.
Ah, ladies, ladies!
Oh, my lord, my lord, forgive my panic!
Give me details.
Is he crazy with love for you?
We’ll bury him, and then we’ll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans, and make death proud to take us.
Welcome.
Fulvia is dead.
Let’s go.
Well, we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause.
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body.
And I will spend our time apart on my knees, praying for you.
Women, dress me like a queen.
That’s good.
Where’s this so-called king?
Your fortunes are the same.
Good-bye, my lord.
I’ll stand guard with you tonight.
Time ambles for both men.
Come on.
Should I do it now?
You’ve seen these illusions.
And I think she’s at least thirty.
Tell us about this wrestling.
Show them in.
He said, “Remember me.” I swore I would.
Your mother’s been poisoned.
I shall faint.
Yes, you’re absolutely right.
But, my lord, this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic.
Mine too, to join hers.
Did it stay a long time?
I’ll leave you now.
I’ll wear a big sword in my belt, carry a boar-spear in my hand, and hide all my womanish fear in my heart.
Don’t you know, master, that some men’s best qualities do them in?
This is what happened: he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace.
This messenger is wise.
We come to hate that which controls us.
Don’t be afraid.
Eat.
So be careful.
You’re not answering my question.
But mistress, know yourself.
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him.
Who would do that?
Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is true.
Come on, good fellow, help me into that armor you’re carrying.
Oh, your contemptible lady!
I beg your pardon.
Madam?
Ah, poor ghost!
Then you are damned.
From head to toe?
Why did you send so many?
What’s the “seventh cause”?
Please take them.
My voice is ragged.
So, tell us, did you see that thing again tonight?
Listen to me, Queen.
No Corin, since you’re old, you cannot guess—even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was, sighing and mooning all night long.
You are all    Lord of lords!
Who’s taken over the watch for you?
You have my friendship.
Give it up and go drink.  
I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt.
Look, sir.
If anyone doubts this, let him put me on trial.
Do they attract big audiences?
Good-bye then, until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear, which will suit you both very well.
Let’s have one, good soldier.
Good-bye.
Call up your courage.
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
You, my earthly moon, are now eclipsed, and that alone foretells my ruin.
My noble brother!
You didn’t want to go then!
Sir and madam, to make grand speeches about what majesty is, what service is, or why day is day, night is night, and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day, night, and time.
Order them to escape.
Just remember that he is Caesar.
And why do you blame me for loving you?
That young man who was just here.
But let’s shake hands, Menas.
You see, we’re not alone in our unhappiness.
Just like the rabbit, who lives where she is born.
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion, until one by one all my children, and every one of my brave Egyptians, are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied, covered by gnats and flies.
Was it long or round?
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of?
Will it eat me?
Are you blushing?
What does Caesar want?
I won’t either, sir.
If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are my Rosalind.
He’s without equal!
Will you fight well?
Do so.
Very well.
My father wasn’t a traitor.
I swear I will, and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster.
You can’t go any further with us, sir.
My arm is sore.
I didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard.
What should I do that I’m not doing?
Whether your banquet is first or last, your Egyptian cooking will make it the best.
But you’re not down and out, either, are you?
He gave Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia to Ptolemy.
Who takes care of them?
I go, Caesar.
Say, “That splendid Antony.” The courageous Caesar!
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome.
It was probably just a rumor.
Well, well, let’s go.
Oh, that splendid Caesar!
But not for long; Charles will take care of everything.
You’re still here?
Please, come with me.
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming.
I’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger.
Taurus!
Come with me, Silvius.
Since the light of my life has gone out, I’ll stop here.
Farewell.
I swear to God it’s true, sir.
Come on, give me your best shot.
And what are you going to do after you’ve spent your money?
Oh, Charmian, I will never leave this tomb!
Bloody, inhuman villain!
Be friendly to people but don’t overdo it.
Don’t joke about his predictions.
Sir, here’s the Queen.
You have all served me well, and kings are your peers.     
Let him go, Gertrude.
This is pure insanity.
You’re talking in such a crazy way, sir.
Bad deeds will be revealed, no matter how people try to hide them.
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws.
There is an emergency I must take care of, but my whole heart will remain here with you.
I want you.
With the handicap they’ve given me, I think I’ll win.
No, keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well.
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man, but he was always my enemy.
My lord, we were sent for.
Was he sad or happy?
Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven.
Where did she die?
And how was that one settled?
Don’t be shy—shake hands with me.
Well, then, what are you messing up?
Why are you so strong and good?
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin.
Let go of me.
Strange and terrible events are all welcome, but I despise comforts.
Now I’ve said it twice.
What you wanted is yours.
When I freed you from slavery, didn’t you swear to do this when I asked you?
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical?
Don’t let us talk you into anything, but consider carefully the value of our offers.
Then by all means never let her walk in public.
What do you want?
They’re retreating, sir, and our superiority indicates a clear victory.
We have to be married properly.
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest.
The sails were dyed purple, and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love.
When the actors were talking about poison?
He brings me freedom.
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind, then what does it mean to leave early?
But I have the meantime.
I’ll be bitter toward him, and curt.
Set it down awhile.
He’ll be done in time.
Isn’t this war against me?
Do you know who I am?
If you like what you see of the land, the profit that’s possible, and this rustic life, I’ll be your faithful servant, and buy the place with your gold right away.
Alas, he is too young.
Oh, stop, fool.
Then I’ll listen to her.
It’s the last command I shall ever give you.
They’re ready whenever you are.
Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier?
What was it?
Come on, sweet Audrey.
Now, my dearest Queen— Please, stand farther away from me.
It was a bit short, my lord.
But if you conspired against my position while you were there, I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt.
Please wait.
The news is true, my lord.
Don’t waste any time.
That’s a poor example.
If she can’t find out what his secret is, then send him off to England or wherever you think best.
Orlando sends his regards to you both, and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “his Rosalind.” Is that you?
Oh, Corin, I wish you could understand how much I love her!
Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me.
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor.
Let me sit down.
There comes an old man with his three sons— It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale.
Yes, as much as you look like yourself.
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller.
I want very much to find out.
The point is that she didn’t write this letter.
Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it.
But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them.
Watch him closely.
If you took a good look at yourself, or if you thought about this more carefully, your fear would teach you to act more cautiously.
My God!
I’ll leave you without revealing any emotion, like a man of steel. 
Then sing it.
I’ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there.
I have quarreled four times, and almost got in a fight.
No one admires speed more than the lazy.
The Emperor is calling for Canidius.
It won’t last.
He taught me how to recognize a man in love, and you’re not a prisoner of love, I’m sure.
That was no show.
No, who are you talking about?
Then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage.
She’s insistent.
No, I swear I’m not.
He’s too argumentative for me.
I bet it will.
Instead of Celia, call me Aliena.
C’mon, make an effort.
And the boys are winning so far?
Amen.
But if you decide not to marry me, you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead?
Dear master, listen to me.
Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasn’t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance?
You will listen to me.
Get out, you horrible bastard, or I’ll gouge out your eyes.
I’ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit.
My lord?
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him, and he ordered Fortinbras’s arrest.
God bless you for being here.
What do you say?
Men’s faces are truthful, whatever their hands do.
I hope so.
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably.
Good sir, as a friend, I advise you to leave this place.
Who’s his lieutenant, do you know?
My lord, could I have a word with you?
Ah, my good old friends!
Come on, you’re a fool, and driven to extreme measures by love.
Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”?
I won’t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat.
Oh, my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors.
Do this immediately, and send him packing.
Not a bit, madam.
But they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself.
Who are the people who want to speak with me?
Don’t spend any more time here.
Then be so kind as to show them in.
Please, Rosalind, my sweet cousin—be happy.
Or, rather, I’ll kill you, or I’ll do away with you, or I’ll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity.
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven?
What, you don’t want me to be chaste?
Goodbye.
In that case, there’s reason to hope a man’s memory may outlive him by six months.
Good-bye for a while.
And yet, words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to.
Like the wind, I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please, as fools do.
It’s like this: as long as a person tells me the truth, even though it means my death, I will listen as though he praised me.
It’s pathetic to be Caesar.
Ever since I’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends, I’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance, grateful for both good and bad.
Come over here, gentlemen, and put your hands on my sword again.
I’ll write how, under his flag and with his well-paid troops, we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia.
With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds.
Mine, neither.
Are you serious?
It’s certain.
Oh, dear!
Be kind to her.
Where is he staying?
Who are they following?
You’re welcome here.
What happened, sir?
I’m completely lost.
Well, not in deed, madam, since I can’t do anything unchaste.
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees?
Pick me up.
He has brought you figs.
Good night, brother.
I certainly do have him, but I wouldn’t advise you to touch him.
Hooray!
Don’t let the Danish king’s bed be a nest of incest.
Now, I’m very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring.
I’m very glad I came to see you.
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib, since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them, while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed.
In Rome, Madam.
After you.
It’s not fair to punish me for something you make me do.
Of course we will.
Yes, as short as a woman’s love.
Pull them apart.
If we were in front of our armies, about to fight, I would do this.
Good Enobarbus, you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly.
Do it now.
And like mine, but I’m getting a little tired of it.
Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.
For lawyers on vacation, because they sleep their holidays away, with no sense of how time moves.
And when some lowlife protests that  Stop, and eat no more.
Procreation is a good thing, but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out, friend.
But I can’t play a melody.
So use your discretion.
I am the worst person alive, and I know it the best.
Yes, it faded away when the rooster crowed.
You’re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else.
Give me your hand.
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die, and in the meantime, we’ll laugh at his challenge.
Stay and speak!
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt, Antony, you’re blushing, which means you’re Caesar’s servant.
Who’s winning?
And hello to you, fair sister.
But here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city.
I have a ship full of treasure.
My name is Decretus.
Lord Hamlet.— Please let him be all right!
You’re not as close to death as you think you are.
I’ll read it to you.
But no beautiful woman has an honest face.
Yawn, snore.
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth, there would be a reason to grieve.
Who, me?
Oh, this is terrible!
I wouldn’t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea.
When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” Well put.
He writes brave poems, speaks brave words, makes brave promises, and then breaks them just as bravely.
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far.
She was previously Caius Marcellus’ wife.
Sport?
Like a young man who wants to amount to something, this morning begins early.
Let him come in.
What, Gertrude?
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there.
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant?
That’s enough.
Hearts cannot think it, tongues cannot speak it, meas-urements cannot calculate it, scribes cannot write it, bards cannot sing it, and poets cannot make verses about it.
I won’t wrong any of my friends, because I don’t have any to mourn for me, and I won’t have wronged the world, because I don’t have anything in the world.
I’ll call you “Hamlet Senior,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” Answer me!
Good heavens, man, give them more than that!
Who will thank us now?
Very wise.
Cut my corset laces, Charmian, so I can breathe.
You’ll do no such thing.
Do you remember anyone who died of it?
I thought everything out here was wild, which is why I acted so stern and commanding.
That’s no lie.
No you haven’t, cousin.
I hear him mock Caesar’s luck, which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath.
I’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you.
Are you on duty again tonight?
Didn’t you talk to it?
And I see you survived your time in Egypt.
Oh, then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me.
Indeed?
Here comes Antony.
Help me out of here.
So get prepared.
Iras, I won’t see you again for a long time.
Don’t wake her.
You’d better get me  But does he know that I’m here in the forest and dressed in men’s clothing?
The hand of death has taken him.
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along.
That’s old news.
Sweet Phoebe, have pity on me.
Who pays their way?
It’s a very sad day.
My lord!
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin; if you were a poet, I might have some hope you were lying.
Lepidus is red in the face.
Do tell.
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times, a staff’s distance from their amazed eyes, while they turned, quaking with fear and too shocked to speak.
Am I a coward?
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain?
It’s very strange.
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?
A worthy fool!
Look—they’re crying.
Listen!
Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him.
Faster, Eros, faster.
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep.
Just now, my lord.
He’s dead.
Yes, hand me one too.
Not if the minor ones come up first.
I hope I never achieve success if I don’t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now.
Another thing, Domitius: Antony wants to see you now.
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours.
Let’s shake on it.
I’ve done a bad thing, for which I will blame myself so much that I’ll never be happy again.
But you know, sirrah, we customarily say that the dead are well.
I’m the one, Hamlet.
Did he stare at you?
Don’t say that, my lord.
Actually, it’s my arm.
Farewell.
Silence!
No, lovely princess.
In the end I grudgingly consented.
No offense taken.
I don’t like her name.
Most formidable Queen!
In Alexandria he condemned Rome, and that’s not all.
Then he’s the whining schoolboy, with a book bag and a bright, young face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school.
I won’t until I’m ready.
If you can leave your body so easily, then the touch of death is like a lover’s pinch, which hurts but is desired.
I have no idea what you’re talking about, Hamlet.
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen.
Horatio says we’re imagining it, and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now.
A faithful shepherd worships you.
Now let my courage prove my title as wife.
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this, she’ll die immediately.
Fear will keep you safe.
And like I am for Ganymede.
I don’t feel guilty about them at all.
Let me have your attention for a moment.
Therefore, dear Isis, do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves.
Then see a good one for me.
I’ll never see it.
Yes.
My lord, welcome this man.
Where is Polonius?
Amen to that!
Damn my suspicious thoughts!
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen.
I’ve been stripped of everything, betrayed.
My belongings are on the ship already.
This is an asp’s trail, and these fig leaves have slime on them, just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile.
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners?
The whole world is a stage, and all the men and women merely actors.
He has come to kill my heart.
Locked in her tomb.
He’s married to Octavia.
You’re a fool.
This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse.
As for my wife, if only you had such a wife.
I haven’t even heard a mouse squeak.
Aren’t I your Rosalind?
May the tongues of our critics rot!
Keep listening.
I can see in your eyes there’s been some good news.
The duke is temperamental.
To the Forest of Arden, to find your father.
After you, my lords?
It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes.
The rapier and the dagger.
Look around you, Caesar.
Let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits, from behind.
Your features, God help us!
If I agree to this, we may leave unharmed, with our shields undented.
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession.
Until then, I have to remain calm.
My lord, when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter’s brother.
Some of this liquor’s still left in the goblet. 
Look!
No, sit down.
Great Mark Antony is a widower now.
I’ll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave.
The Queen is coming.
I know you are loyal and honorable.
Here comes the man himself.
You haven’t seen him since?
But his navy rules the sea.
Just listen to him.
I’m surprised I didn’t bite back.
I saw him once.
Give a quick example.
You’re making me go off-key.
Oh, noble fool!
Six Barbary horses, six French swords with accessories, and three imaginatively designed carriages—sounds like a French bet against the Danish.
Goodbye, sir.
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony’s former soldiers—enough to capture him.
They’re coming.
I swear I won’t, sir.
But if you die before I return, you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts.
And still do, I swear by my hands.
Where is that messenger?
I do, in fact.
Were you listening to these verses?
Well, sir, go inside.
No, please don’t hate him—for my sake.
No, not at all, sir.
Madam, oh, good Empress!
Like gambling, sir?
The man hasn’t done anything wrong.
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill, in sight of Caesar’s navy.
You must go to Parthia.
Where’s Dolabella?
Cupid—that blind bastard son of Venus, conceived from a thought and anger, born from insanity, that blind, naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can’t see himself—let Cupid judge how deep my love runs.
It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents.
By Jove that thunders!
No braver than this?
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful.
No, listen to it, Antony.
I will, madam.
Menas, I’m not going back on shore.
Yes, from top to bottom, sir.
Man, they were asking for it.
You’re alive.
And as for my soul, how can the ghost endanger that, since it’s as immortal as the ghost is?
I’ll join you, sir.
Give me a kiss.
You don’t have more than half an hour to live.
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source.
I’ve only been hurt, not killed.
Come with me, I’ll show you, and along the way, you can tell me where you live.
That’s enough about that.
Thank you, madam.
Why are we talking about him like this?
You should say, “I sort of know him, but not well.
Off!
Treat them with honor and dignity.
You’d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return.
I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man.
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed. 
Yes, dear madam.
Please don’t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly.
Speak.
I thumb my nose at superstitions.
She has betrayed me and shall die.
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing?—Come on, sister, you can be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
He’ll grow up to be a proper man.
Our Queen is dead too.
Gentlemen, please try to sharpen his interest even more, and let this play do him some good.
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed.
Oh, correct it completely.
It’s all still yours.
Pull off my beard?
Thank you.
But since,  To get back to the matter at hand, what do you think of our proposal?
I have a daughter (I have her until she gets married) who’s given me this letter, considering it her duty.
Now, if courtiers were shepherds, that kind of courtesy would be unclean.
And so I said to my daughter: “Lord Hamlet is a prince, he’s out of your league.
Yes, even if I die an hour later.
Did you think I was talking about sex?
When you begged to stay, that was the time for words.
Affection!” That’s nothing!
Agrippa, go start the battle.
Follow his chariot, like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender.
I hope so too, Madam.
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man.
No, I won’t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick.
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia.
Whose was it?
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is—
Those are only two of his weapons.
This is his sword.
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails.
It’s lovely to see you.
So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy.
When a great leader dies he doesn’t die alone but, like a whirlpool, draws others with him.
Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him.
Now please leave me alone.
Not very well, but I’ve met him several times.
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land.
Tell the actors to hurry.
I don’t know what you mean, madam.
And Rosencrantz!
Do you want to hear what she says?
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away, or wait awhile.
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes—politely—before you begin your match.
What could I hope to get from you, who’ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life?
Here I am at your service, my dear lord.
You have a beautiful half-sister, Octavia.
Take me to Antony.
How excellent for Antony!
Is he standing or sitting?
May you die of the worst disease!
I order you, speak!
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and observe the people.
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly, he’ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you.
How do you feel, Laertes?
So be it.
What’s wrong with you?
And when will you see him again?
Now, Charmian!
What else?
The only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it, too.
Three proper young men, all good looking and with great presence—
Most noble man, will you die?
May the gods be with you.
This is the inventory of the money, silverware, dishes, and jewels that are still in my possession.
In return, I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome.
What a sad sight!
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world? 
I can’t speak to her, even though she asked me to.
What are they doing on the road?
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances.
Answer me in a word.
I accept with thanks, Enobarbus.
Oh, just see what happens after the pageantry is over!
I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then.
Yes, my lord.
It’s my exercise time.
Most kind messenger, tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand.
Afraid that your anger would not subside, she sent you word she was dead.
I overlooked your request, but I did not deny it.
I’d heard about my brother’s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but he’s determined.
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education.
I had a scar here that looked like a “T”; now it’s an “H.” They’re retreating.
Please, let’s not talk about it.
That was me, but it’s not me— I’m not ashamed to tell you what I once was, since I’m so happy to have since converted.
Then love me, Rosalind.
But where is he?
You were worn with honor. 
You certainly made me believe you did, my lord.
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune.
Come, Dolabella.
She went from me, who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage, to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine.
Terrible.
Let Caesar do whatever he wants.
I learned to do this from you. 
There, my lord.
Make the best use of this information you can.
I can’t speak any more. 
There’s another.
Get yourself to a 
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
The whole time.
But do this: find your brother, wherever he is.
Quiet!
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation.
I hope not, Madam.
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this.
I’ll meet it if it’s the last thing I do.
That’s the deal.
I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins.
Nah, I don’t care what their 
He’s in his chambers now, and he’s extremely upset.
Farewell.
How did he say good-bye?
Tell me, who is this knight?
How could I forget, my lord!
Then you can hear my news, as dessert.
Our master and mistress are looking for you.
Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him!
And I am your Rosalind.  
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods.
Oh, sir— Don’t think I’m flattering you.
I’ll trust my determination and my hands, but none of Caesar’s men.
If you’re calling me Jephthah, my lord, I do have a daughter I love more than anything, yes.
If your love was anything like mine—and I’m sure that no man has loved as I love now—exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to?
My lord, I have news for you.
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that it’s a shepherd’s life, it’s worthless.
Friends, go.
No, he was wicked and vile.
Do I, sir?
He is like a god and knows the truth.
Let’s go.
He is the general challenger.
Come on, let me wipe your face.
The gods forbid!
Hello there, good sirs.
Right, and they wore proclamations around their necks, saying, “Be it known to all men by these  The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler.
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling?
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection.
But in this way, grief and comfort appear together.
Do it immediately, or all your previous services to me were accidental, without purpose.
Call him over here, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Did God make him?
After a brief time—as he is a strong, brave man—
It will be to your advantage, because I’ll leave our father’s house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest.
Good-bye, sir.
If you ever loved me, then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile, and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story.
Oh, excellent!
I’ll give you mine.
I don’t want to be cured, boy.
Good duke, come receive your daughter.
Ah, soldier!
The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away.
Well, so-so.
I don’t feel so well, but I won’t stop.
Help me, ladies!
Oh, really?
Once again you bring good news.
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas.
But in fact it doesn’t say much.
What do you say now?
I’ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave.
The next day we had our fight at sea, and you know what happened after that.
What’s the play called?
If we leave, it will feel like nothing less than death to them.
My lord, I will give them all they deserve.
I’d kiss you before I spoke.
Oh, I’d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven, Horatio, than have lived through that terrible day!
I mean well, sir.
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union, I wouldn’t say that.
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint.
He won’t fight with me, Domitius?
Don’t mess with me.
From Silvius, sir.
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments.
This is what it’s all about— Please, I beg you— No, my lord, I’m comfortable like this, thank you.
What’s your business?
Oh God, do I have to remember that?
Don’t you know me still?
And you won’t until the needy eat.
This means we’re having some mischievous fun.
What’s that?
Give him this money and these letters, Reynaldo.
He can’t like her very long.
So, goodbye.
Ah ha!
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father’s dukedom.
However your wit and luck allow.
If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole.
With no more ceremony than that?
Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips!
Dress me up in motley.
It’s my birthday.
That’s all he asks for himself.
It’s true, I confess.
Tell me why, if you can.
You said it right, old mole.
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
Good night to you both.
I don’t have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer.
These child actors are now in fashion, and they’ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all, they’re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys.
Not me.
I’ll speak to them, and then tonight I’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds.
I’ve heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid.
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and, looking at it solemnly, said, “It’s ten o'clock.
Listen!
It’s only going to make you sad, Monsieur Jaques.
What would I do besides good?
Give him your arm.
And if our navy wins tomorrow, no doubt our army will do their part.
Aren’t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors, which they are going to grow up and become?
Oh, Caesar, this Charmian lived until a moment ago.
Sir, what is your opinion of me?
Don’t argue against it.
On my honor and by my word, if you outstay the ten days, you will die.
You got me, I admit it.
Most noble sir, stand up.
Let me shake your hand.
Welcome to Rome.
I’ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run.
Please, marry us.
I’m so sorry.
Don’t do it, sir.
But if I really laid him bare, I’d have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking.
Protect me, my friends.
And your experience makes you sad.
Oh, there’s been a lot of quarreling.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
And smelled like that, too?
Your wife, Fulvia, is dead.
The nobleman’s are as huge as the underfed villager’s.
Oh, Ophelia, I’m bad at poetry.
Yes, we will.
He didn’t ask questions, but answered ours at length.
All right, but first let the ambassadors speak.
I’d obey even if she were my mother ten times over.
I don’t like the way he’s acting, and it’s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control.
And like I am for Ganymede.
Welcome, lady.
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding.
Which speech, my lord?
We’re all waiting for the revenge!  
I’m not a slut—I keep myself clean—but I thank God I am ugly.
I’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight.
It’s still waving to me.
My lord, I have some mementos of yours that I’ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now.
Well, what’s going on, mister?
I’d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers.
Is he married?
Let’s go to him.
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter.
If Caesar chose, Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend.
For I’m sure that although you may know what temperance is, you’ve never experienced it firsthand.
And I your servant.
My lord, the queen wants to speak with you right away.
We’ll take care of it.
An era of universal peace is about to start.
No, I swear, I don’t even know what’s in it.
I’m ready to hear you.
Then please, put off your eating for a little while I, like a mother doe, find my fawn and bring it food.
But don’t do that.
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real.
What do you say, Caesar?
Me too, I swear.
If  Well, I’ll just forget the difficulties of my situation, in order to focus on the happiness of yours.
Listen to many people, but talk to few.
Dear master, I can’t go any farther.
They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts.
You are welcome here, sister.
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace.
His position is hopeless.
He rejected my authority as much as yours.
If what you feel is really love, tell me how much.
Good-bye, good Queen.
What are you doing here in Elsinore?
Play with me, Charmian.
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me.
Now any effort ruins what it attempts.
Oh no, not if you say it right.
He’s in Athens, my lord.
Let’s go, Menas.
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world.
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and you’ll see that I’ll reward you.
You were right the first time.
He’ll never agree to that.
And, being a man of your breeding, you’re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar?
Would you like to be king of the entire world?
What can you do but be happy?
No, he hasn’t.
Later, in a better world than this, I’d love to get to know you.
Oh, Cleopatra!
Be patient, your highness.
Please, your Grace, tell me what crime I have committed.
Excuse me?
I’m going to make you a rich man.
Is he really married?
Just as tall as my heart.
I will advise him to speak as he usually does.
Menas, I don’t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones.
What else?
Good.
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony’s attention away from that Egyptian widow. 
No, who are  Long live the king!
We’ve advanced too far.
Yes, the second time around, since, as they say, old people become children again.
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life.
And so, good-bye.
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
Hey, let’s have some music here!
But now I must condemn it.
If your master wants a queen to beg from him, you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom.
Because he’s so young, I’ve tried to discourage him, but he won’t listen.
Are you wise?
Don’t attack by land.
I’ll poison you, or beat you with a club, or stab you with a sword.
Well, if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity, then I can’t scratch my own ear.
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria.
I have no idea how.
Or if you haven’t sat as I do now, boring your listener with all your lover’s virtues, then you haven’t loved.
You should know that I think you’re a smart man.
Believe what?
Thank you, sir.
Not in my husband’s nose.
Yes, my lord.
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye.
If Cleopatra heard you, you would be well punished for your audacity.
Explain.
Please, let me go.
Where do you think he is now?
Give me my fishing rod.
I must go attend Caesar.
She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn’t get enough of him.
My son will win.
Your worst fault is being in love.
Here’s the water, right?
I like to pretend you are, because then it’s almost like actually talking to her.
Can’t what, my lord?
Who’s there?
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.
I’ll bring you to him right away.
All traitors protest like this.
I’ll tell him, my lord.
This guy will tell us everything.
Her eyes are like April: full of showers.
What’s going on between you two?
Is he dead?
I think of as many things as he does, but I just thank heaven and don’t show off about it.
If you want to read it, as I haven’t heard it yet, though I’ve heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.
It’s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that.
Do not, Phoebe.
No, most likely.
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have.
Don’t be quick to pick a fight, but once you’re in one, hold your own.
Call in the messengers and we’ll find out.
Do you know him?
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
What’s that sound?
Oh, this is wonderful, wonderful—just wonderful wonderful!
But when our vices become habits—Oh, the sadness of it!—the wise gods blind us, shade our better judgment, make us love our mistakes, and laugh as we strut to our ruin. 
Did they make you the messenger?
There’s no clock here in the forest.
Sure, or anything else you show him.
No, not like before.
Do you hear what I say, lady?
Goodbye.
I will, Caesar.
I’d rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me, making me disgusting.
I can’t go any further.
We’re glad to see you.
Tonight let’s have plenty to eat.
But you had better get back to Egypt again.
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome.
I wish I were as big and strong as you.
And here comes father.
Well,        Aren’t I right, Jephthah, old man?
Give me my robe.
Come and see the proof.
Well, praise the Lord you’re ugly.
I won’t hurt him.
Whatever I think, I have to say.
And like I am for no woman.
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated.
I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative.
You won’t be striking me down, but defeating Caesar.
Doesn’t anyone else want to see this, and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs?
We’ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father’s guards, whom he’ll send out as soon as he discovers I’ve gone.
Yes.
Okay, I will—on Fridays and Saturdays, and the rest.
These vows are just traps for stupid birds.
Oh!
What would you like, sir?
Oh, what an excellent young man!
Are you drunk?
I’m helping  Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while.
I think it was at sea.
At dinner.
Yes sir, thank God.
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do.
Show her in.  
But why, why, why?
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed, and early this morning the bed was empty.
But, oh, heavenly Rosalind!
Caesar and he are better friends than ever.
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you.
But back to that argument you mentioned.
If he has my father’s love, then that’s enough honor for me.
By God, it does look like a camel.
Oh, I’ve heard him talk about that brother, and he described him as the most inhumane man alive.
Don’t ever tell anyone what you’ve seen tonight.
Come on.
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward.
I thank you very much on his behalf.
Fulvia is dead.
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin, with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her.
You agree now that we’re not imagining this, don’t you?
Quiet!
If not, then I have no powers of observation.
Gallus, you go with him.
Your authorization is ready.
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row, excepting meal times and sleeping hours.
Well put, Maecenas.
Why, she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian.
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest.
And why are you noble, strong, and brave?
They’re overdoing it.
Tell me how.
Sailors, sir.
Into my grave.
No, that’s the truth.
I swear to God, if I hadn’t seen this with my own eyes I’d never believe it.
My heart, which dried out with grief, will surely break apart into a powder, and that will be the end of my disgusting mind.
Swear by my sword.
A god of a god?
Come, let’s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful.
I’ll go tell the king about this.
What’s the trouble?
Looking just like the dead king.
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog, kissing the corpse—by the way, do you have a daughter?
Are you going to write Antony about this?
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles, traveling on the ice in sleds.
The gods know— Oh, never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been.
A snail?
Treason!
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one, you would have a million children.
Barnardo’s taken my place.
They’ve switched their operation to the sea today.
Oh, finish what I’ve begun.
And how he loves Caesar!
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds, bursting everyone’s eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse, who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows.
Are you educated?
You don’t know?
Now, Eros.
I know when a man is on fire, he’ll swear anything.
If that’s what you mean, I’ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words.
They still haven’t joined the battle.
We didn’t please them on land.
Let’s stay and watch.
And like I am for Rosalind.
Have a good night!
He was a great human being.
But if you believe everything they say, you won’t be saved by half of what they do.
Eat and sleep.
She’ll die for it.—Eros, ho!
Is it “chaste in word and action”?
Doesn’t he deserve it?
Go away.
There were no primary ones.
Yes, but swear by my sword this time.
What!
How goes it, friend Eros?
This is just a trifling matter here, sir.
Brown, madam, and she wouldn’t want her forehead to be any lower.
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass, the cup becomes empty.
No, I’ll help too.
Oh, I followed something I’m ashamed to look at now!
Let me say first, madam, that he is well.
Good madam, be patient.
I’ll rest now.
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him.
And why do you blame me for loving you?
Leave me.  
Come on.
It cannot be.
The foul plan backfired on me.
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud, just like the crocodile.
Is that a tradition?
Not offensive at all.
Now Antony has to leave her completely.
And wouldn’t I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm?
And its tears are wet.
Either I had to ruin you, or you would have ruined me.
I’ve botched the job, friends.
We’ll take you there.
Since you know all this is true, why do you blame me for loving you?
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus, who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight, tell them to hurry.
We’re ready for both, my lord.
You drank horses’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse.
Goodbye, good Mr. Love.
Here’s where they’ll end up, on the floor.
Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels?
Young Fortinbras, returning in triumph from Poland, is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors.
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams.
If we’re  Hello, Monsieur Le Beau.
I know the man well.
I am the duke who loved your father.
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips, I’ll be covered in blood.
Don’t keep anything back, I insist.
Do whatever you like with it.
I can’t, my lord.
There’s a nicer piece of work right here.
One of you run to the Queen with the news.
How did he look?
It’s about who I am, and how, why, and where this handkerchief was stained.
Welcome back!
She has disarmed me.
Polite sir, let me say one thing.
What do you think about it?
I didn’t love you.
What’s that, my lord?
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again.
We didn’t expect Mark Antony to be here.
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius’ possessions, which we seized in Sicily.
Poor poisonous fool, be angry and bite.
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so.
Send a message to his brother.
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs.
Meanwhile, thank you for your efforts.
Nothing.
Oh, it’s horrible, horrible, so horrible!
I’ll go see my mother soon.
Is that you, Diomedes?
Orlando.
The Egyptian flagship, the  Gods and goddesses—the whole congregation of them!
Could that be a lawyer’s skull?
The people are on my side, and I’m in charge of the sea.
That’s what I want you to tell me.
It must go like this.
Really, young men, though it wasn’t a very hard song to get right, the music was still all out of tune.
Poor Antony!
Damn it!
I’ve never been your enemy.
It’s come again.
They’re in the heat of passion; they simply have to be together.
On the platform where we stand guard, sir.
I do.
The whole world could look at you, and no one would be as blind as he is, thinking you’re beautiful.
I know the king and queen sent for you.
I’ll give the first one, Pompey.
His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone.
I’m only crazy sometimes.
I mean what I say.
I’ll ask you another question.
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony?
You have seen the cruel proof of this man’s strength.
He’ll recover his sanity there.
While he was still in Rome, he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled.
As you please.
I know him well.
He’s not your relative.
He got what he deserved.
Tell me who shall have the better luck, Caesar or me?
I could cure you, if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me.
It’s a lucky sign, isn’t it?
I know I may be old, but I’m strong and healthy, because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly.
We don’t think so, my lord.
No, I won’t.
But that would ruin his reputation!
You say he’s friendly with Caesar, healthy, and free.
Why, the he that will marry this woman.
You belong to her.
I’ve already sent the proof in my letters.
So good-bye for now.
No, it’s just after twelve; I heard the clock strike.
Now I’m alone.
May the gods bless you.
My heart’s as black as death.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers—where the swords hang.
I’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her, but I won’t use one on her.
Indeed, you would be out if I were your mistress—if my chastity is worth as much as my wit.
Most powerful lord, my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you.
Yes, I do, sir.
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.
God bless my old master.
Good afternoon, good gentleman.
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat.
Me too, but still, for the sake of good manners, I’ll say thanks for your company.
Only Antony was at fault.
I always loved you.
Do you maintain the same story?
Whether you’re a good spirit or a cursed demon, whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire, whether your intentions are good or evil, you look so strange I want to talk to you.
Then Caesar and he will always be united.
Ha, ha, ha!
If it looks like my good father, I’ll speak to it, even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet.
No, Pompey, I haven’t had anything to drink.
Call the messengers!  
Mistress and master, you’ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with, the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with.
Why do you want to do that, my lord?
Good-bye.
Not someone who doesn’t share that disposition, meaning Mark Antony.
But major issues must come before minor ones.
My soul is stuck to sin, and the more it struggles to break free, the more it sticks.
That way Antony will feel like he’s fighting his own men.
Get ready for the third hit, Laertes.
I served Mark Antony, who was the commander most worthy of my services.
Yes, if it doesn’t stand still.
Damn it!
Young boy, I wish I could make you believe that I’m in love.
I am dying, Cleopatra, dying.
Let me speak my mind, and I’ll rid the world of its sickness—if it will only tolerate my medicine.
Who do you think you are coming in here armed?
There is a poor old man who, purely out of love, has limped after me for miles.
Is your name William?
How could you ask?
And I hope he’s studying his music like he’s supposed to.
Damn you for mocking me.
We’ll go to the river.
Last night, when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it’s shining now, at one o'clock, Marcellus and I— Quiet, shut up!
The sight made me so sick I couldn’t watch any more. 
Is it possible?
More or less.
That’s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long.
I’ll tell you.
I’m proud to be Sir Rowland’s son—his youngest son—and I would never change that, not even to be Frederick’s adopted heir.
He deserves it, even if it were covered with jewels like holy 
No, Antony.
Come on, woo me, woo me.
Well, then it isn’t one to you, since nothing is really good or bad in itself—it’s all what a person thinks about it.
He loves Caesar best, but he also loves Antony.
I’ll tell you at a better time.
To none but you, only to you.
If you are human, don’t stand for it.
Who’s coming here?
When I have praised Antony, I’ve disparaged Caesar.
Humble as I am, I represent Antony.
My lord, how are you feeling?
Stop eating?
If he’s ready now, so am I.
My name is Thidias.
Go home to bed, Francisco.
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on.
Yes, it is.
Let me ask you a particular question.
I’m not going to be bothered by you for long.
Go ahead if you want, but remember that crying doesn’t suit a man.
You don’t know that?
Really?
I long to be immortal.
What are you saying?
I’ll write him a taunting letter, and you can deliver it.
I have the motivation, the willpower, the ability, and the means to do it.
Give me some wine and let me say a few words.
Do as I say.
Madam!
I’m learning every hour how to be subservient.
Like the  Oh stop it, you lusty bed-hopper.
Soundly, my lord.
I will, Caesar.
You’re a natural-born philosopher!
On what grounds?
Listen, Guildenstern, and you too, Rosencrantz—listen as close as you can!
Your death would prevent that.
Caesar’s speed defies belief.
A messenger has arrived from Caesar.
My lord, he just left here.
Let me try: If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do.
See, now I have you.
It’s proper that we speak first, which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration.
Who are you, slave?
Me too.
Well, I’m the man you’re speaking of.
God help you, foolish man.
I’ll leave now, to set all these things right.
But honestly, I should have been a woman.
Whew!
Dead.
No, my lord, your polite words are not to the point.
Madam, madam— Antony’s dead!
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails.
If I had the goddess Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury, pick you up and seat you beside Jove.
Speak.
Come along, though.
Not that I know of.
Are you done yet?
You’re lucky, my lord, to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you.
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks.
Ah, you sorceress!
I swear by the sun that when I leave here, it will be as your faithful servant.
No, nothing.
You can’t take anything from me that I care less about—except my life, except my life, except my life.
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind.
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company?
Well, hello there, Horatio!
I doubt it.
Well, I’m not beautiful, so I hope that I can at least be chaste.
Now, good-bye.
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome.
Adieu, good Mr. Depression.
And if we don’t shake hands, when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I’m happier to see them than you.
If our eyes were policemen, they might capture two thieves at once while we’re embracing.
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane.
You’re just playing around.
It is rather cold, indeed, my lord.
Yes, for your own safety, you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea.
No, not at all.
I was his daughter when you banished him.
Good luck, worthy soldier, and good-bye.
And how did she react to all this?
Don’t think I’m so dumb that I don’t know that the devil himself won’t eat a woman.
I can’t put my feelings into verse, but please believe I love you best, oh, best of all.
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty.
We have enough supplies for it, and they’ve earned it.
I won’t be a soldier anymore.
I folded up the new document, signed it, sealed it, and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference.
I could do more to help Antony, but to do so would insult him.
I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.
Is this well done?
I smile and think, “Thank goodness the wind doesn’t flatter me: it’s like a councilor who makes me feel what I’m really made of.” Adversity can have its benefits—like the ugly, poisonous  I wouldn’t change my situation for anything.
Then Octavia’s complaints will rouse Caesar, and as I said before, the thing that brought them together will part them.
They’ve made many raids upon Italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them.
We’ll do our duty to you, sir.
A better example—come on.
Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has.
Orlando, do you really believe that this boy can do everything he’s promised?
I did, sir, but it didn’t answer me.
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person.
Thank you.
But, sir— Why should you do this, you want to know?
Rosalind, I have to leave you for two hours.
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him.
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making up feeble excuses. 
And just try to remember a few rules of life.
Cram your good news into my ears.
I humbly thank you.
By Isis, I’ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony, my best man among men. 
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her.
Tell me the truth.
I prefer to call it a “hanger.” But anyway.
Are you rich?
Have a safe trip.
Wholeheartedly, good young man.
I’ll follow it.
I bet she’ll chew him out.
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me.
Oh, I’m dying, Horatio!
Forever and a day.
Hey, you!
Hold off burying her until I’ve caught her in my arms once more.
But everything that lives is mortal, including the foolishness of love.
Indeed, she gives a very good testimony of the snake’s power.
That’s my brave lord!
No, longer than that.
Are you thinking about me?
The gods have ordained it to be like this, sir.
Get me out of here!
It’s weird.
Welcome back to Denmark, my lord.
I’ll cure you of your insolence, and I’m not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!—Hey, Dennis!
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister.
I swear, if anyone holds me back, I’ll make a ghost of him!
Thank God I’m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex.
Ah, leave it alone.
Oh, sun, I will never see another one of your sunrises.
I would not.
Now, we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment.
You’re going to lose this bet, my lord.
And time itself is ended.
I don’t know what to believe, father.
I’ll wait for you in your cave, where you can tell me what you need from me.
I hope you get what you desire!
Queen, you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you.
Be calm, dear lady.
I’m positively stuffed with air, I eat so much of it.
Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial.
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts.
Then a third of the world is drunk.
I have a good plan.
Hamlet.” Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter, and more like it.
My niece, you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter.
Come with me, sir.
And servants of the Danish king.
Don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this, out of duty and love?
Cleopatra— Do you think there ever was, or could there ever be, a man such as the one I dreamed about?
What do you say?
Is it possible Fulvia is dead?
I hereby grant your request, and hope you have a good time.
No, they’re busy and as excellent as ever.
When he raised his arm in command, the world trembled.
All right, you’ve had your say, but we’ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely.
The fractured world, in its confusion, should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens.
In this letter you’ll find details of her illness and other, more serious matters that concern you.
My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow.
No, I didn’t say that.
What features?
By the end I will either live, or else I’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood.
That’s him, madam.
I’m just saying that if you’re good and beautiful, your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty.
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it, and by Rosalind.
So we are in agreement.
She stood trembling, then suddenly dropped dead.
Shame on you—get on board!
I didn’t think you would follow me.
Good night.
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love.
We’re very sorry, sir, that you may not live to wear us out with your commands.
What brings him here?
But  Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately?
The queen your mother is upset, and sent me to see you.
As for Antony, I’m not interested in his requests.
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree.
Horatio, you’re the best man I’ve ever known.
Don’t you trust my sword and these wounds?
Why would anyone flatter a poor person?
But not in heaven.
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend.
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.
But it doesn’t matter.
I’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do.
Tomorrow is the happy day, Audrey.
My dearest sister!
I’ve been poisoned.
Were you born here?
But wait, what’s that sound?
My brother didn’t use my name to justify his rebellion.
Did he cry?
And he’s made the holiest vows to me, to back up what he says.
Don’t you realize the duke has also banished me, his daughter?
Lead them inside.
I wish she’d never let you come.
Nice to see you again, Horatio—that is your name, right?
Why, the one I just told you about.
Who is this fool?
Near  How large is his land army?
Here’s to Caesar.
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument, hasn’t Fortune sent this fool here to stop us?
You’re pale and trembling.
He can’t speak, my lord.
The king has bet six Barbary horses, and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories.
I invite you all aboard my ship.
There isn’t any kindness in the snake.
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose.
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it.
Madam, how are you liking this play?
If that’s true, he won’t get it back by crying.
Shut up, fool.
Sir, it’s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width.
What, would you have me beg for my food?
Yes, please; unleash your wisdom.
Oh, sir, you are too good at predicting the future.
Well, until that time, don’t come near me.
You are an honest man.
Hang there on this tree, you lines of poetry, and bear witness to my love.
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large.
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully.
I’m begging you, tell me who it is quickly, and speak fast.
It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted city’s native citizens, should be gouged with arrows.
That it was, sir.
Damn that crazy madman!
This is the man.
Come then, kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips.
Drink up.
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her?
What does a crocodile look like?
Who’s there?
And if you rattle on about mountains, then let them throw millions of acres over us.
Oh, chest, obey me!
In the meantime, I’ll raise an army that will surpass his.
It doesn’t matter.
Prepare yourself, please, for this trip.
Young boys and girls are equal to men.
Tomorrow I’ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved, in having what he wished for.
Agree to swear.
I just beg death to wait awhile, until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips.
So be quiet.
I will, sir.
It’s terrifying.
Charmian!
Okay, but when?
Did he ask about me?
I’ll think of something.
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books.
Farewell, and thanks.
Will you two help them get ready?
It will be as the gods see fit.
Me too.
May the god of power make me, the weakest of the weak, your mediator.
Yes, he will, and the queen as well.
It was armed, you say?
What is this passion that ties up my tongue?
If there’s any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor, speak to me.
What’s going on, Rosalind?
Your Emperor is still a king among gods.
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness?
I sense you’re treating me like a child.
I’m no villain.
They were poisoned, then.
That’s how we’ll do it, then.
You won’t kill me, will you?
I’ll be nice to him.
Prison, my lord?
He lay there, stretched out like a wounded knight.
You go and take care of your business (since everybody has some business to take care of, whatever it is worth), and I’ll go and pray.
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men’s feasts and cried tears of pity—therefore, sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs.
I’ll be back soon, and if I haven’t brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die.
That’s another sin arising from your ignorance: you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation.
But things have changed there, and it’s easier for them on the road now.
Good day and happiness to you, darling Rosalind.
Since I was three years old, I’ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician—no black magic here.
Even though I’m mad, I won’t bite him.
What’s your message?
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions.
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them, they’ll battle each other to the death to have it all.
The next day I explained all this to him, which was as good as begging his pardon.
Madam, I’d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it.
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand—what’s her name now?
What did he do when you saw him?
Be at ease.
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any.
Hear everyone’s opinion, but reserve your judgment.
Thank God”—that’s a good answer.
Yes indeed it is, sir.
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me?
Oh, I wish I could sleep again, so I could have another dream like that!
It makes me very happy to hear he’s so interested.
I’m going to cry.
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe.
Your wife, Fulvia, mustered her army first.
I’ve said what I have to say.
May good luck follow you!
When you find out who started this disagreement, turn your anger upon them.
Be happy.
It’s not true.
What do I see here?
Oh, that was unbelievably low!
I’m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .
I hope we’ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company, sir.
It’s mine, sir.
Not at all, Touchstone.
Oh, that’s ominous!
Welcome.
They’ll tell all.
It has the mark of 
Enobarbus, Antony has sent you all your treasure, with generous gifts besides.
Forty thousand brothers, if you added all their love together, couldn’t match mine.
You will be whipped.  
Let me tell you, friends—
But that’s another story.
I know you’d never skip school.
Of course.
With this I avoid the grief of Antony’s death.
I, fight against you, Antony?
Oh, yes, we could, sir.
Pinch my nose?
Do you really speak like such a gentleman?
Even though it’s early, there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor.
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense, my hearty friends.
Yes, I should know, but it disturbs me.
Do you want to know the truth?
Come, sit, sit, and sing me a song.
I can.
Oh, Antony!
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost the most consummate Alexas, where’s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen?
Or was it just your whim, on your own initiative?
What’s going on, Horatio?
But mortals like you aren’t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife.
I’d rather bear with you than  Well, this is the Forest of Arden.
His beard was gray, right?
No, this fun is not for me.
But I have a sinking feeling anyway.
As you were on land.
I’m sure you do.
Yes, it’s me.
Call my guard, please.
His feelings don’t move in that direction.
I’ve never been taught how to make anything.
Good, sir?
This is how they do it, sir: they measure the depth of the Nile, according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid.
You’ve served me faithfully.
I’m not dead?
My letters are ready to go.
It’s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone.
Tomorrow, soldier, I’ll fight by sea and land.
Join your witchcraft with your beauty, and let Antony’s lust combine with both.
I’m glad about that.
I’ll get your goats, Audrey.
As long as you aren’t ashamed to show it, he won’t be ashamed to tell you what it means.
Oh, forgive me!
The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits.
Wasn’t Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
What is it?
Let’s listen to him.
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself.
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured.
Definitely not.
And like I am for no woman.
It was not Caesar’s bravery that conquered Antony but Antony’s that has triumphed over himself.
What quality is that, my lord?
You’ve bet on the weaker fencer.
Take care of the queen!
Make sure everyone knows that.
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite.
You’ve come right on time.
Not true.
I’ll do whatever the king wants.
Yes, be content, good Touchstone.
Orlando?
Gentle cousin, let’s go thank him and encourage him.
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won’t be going outside to make war.
We thought you ought to know about it.
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome?
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it.
He wasn’t sad, because he knows that his disposition affects others.
Take revenge for his horrible murder, that crime against nature.
The wind is filling your ship’s sail, and they’re waiting for you.
Oh, I’m dying of hunger.
Please sir, if love or money can buy anything in this empty place, tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves.
Yes, sir.
So you couldn’t see his face, then?
No!
Now I’ll tell you the other story about my journey.
My lady, should I lie in your lap?
I can’t live by pretending anymore.
If you have a voice or can make sounds, speak to me.
Cough them up.
Then I guess I was misled.
It’s yours.
Honestly, you’re speaking the truth—ever since the fools were  With his mouth full of news.
I heard that Apollodorus carried—   What did he carry, please?
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose!
Welcome, my good Alexas.
Don’t you care about me?
I’ll say you’re not feeling well.
You are very welcome here.
What are you saying?
Ah, I’ve got it!
Is that how the law sees it?
In this wicked world, criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law, shoving justice aside.
Horns?
Farewell, kind master.
Are you starting to challenge me?
Well, that’s what the wife brings to the marriage.
Now I am no more than a woman, ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores.
I like it better than laughing.
You are only a soldier.
But what about the bloody handkerchief?
Look, sir—here it comes!
No, my lord, it’s been four months.
Let’s hear what he has to say.
Treason!
Just keep your love under control, and don’t let yourself become a target of his lust.
Honestly, no.
What are you  Nothing.
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise.
Not the time I saw it.
No, I’m begging you now, tell me who it is.
Go!
In that case, the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good.
Swear you won’t.
As it dissolves, so shall my life.
I can’t talk now.
What kind of fighting cock is this?
If grief doesn’t kill me, I’ll find a quicker way to kill myself—even though I think grief will do the job just as well.
He’ll be like this for a little while.
Well, God bless this marriage!
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money.
What color is her hair?
So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.
Where is she?
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes; I’ll scratch them out.
Quiet!
Horatio, tell me something.
What did you say to me?
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change.
The lady’s overdoing it, I think.
Oh cousin, cousin, cousin, my sweet little cousin, I wish you knew how deep in love I am.
They’re lying over there, and the poor old man, their father, weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving.
This news is absolutely true: Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now.
Yes, please tell me.
I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
I just saw him yesterday,” or “the other day,” or whenever it is, you know, “and there he was gambling,” or “there he was, totally wasted, or fighting with somebody about a tennis match, or going into a house of ill repute”—that means a whorehouse, you know—or whatever.
A person can only pay with their life once, and she has paid in full.
But it can’t help either!
I’m begging you.
It’s too bad.
Then why did you travel so quietly?
It’s a strange snake.
Sir, he left his belongings and treasure.
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow’s battle to be the last we fight.
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle: either too much at once or none at all.
No, our general’s infatuation is out of control.
You told me that you don’t salute at the court but kiss hands.
I cannot live without her.
Time travels at different speeds for different people.
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand  I like this news, and when I have time I’ll read this and think about how to reply.
It is for your ears only.
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts!
Dolabella, I will always be in debt to you.
Why do you pity him?
Let’s play billiards.
Do what he says, William.
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death.
What is your name, young man?
Yes, my lord, quite well.
Your servants are waiting.
No, you have to swear it.
In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it.
It’s very hot.
Why, what’s the matter?
Our fate depends on this chance.
He certainly is.
Do you want to get married, fool?
Where did he go?
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money.
Whoo-hoo!
Do you hear that, men?
Insolent  Oh, the good gods!
Then that’s the way it may turn out.
Get out of my sight, or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar’s victory.
Please remember, love.
This was the basket.
Has there ever been a time—I’d really like to know—when I’ve definitely said something was true, and it turned out not to be true?
What, you mean kid actors?
Dear God, please make him normal again!
The poison is as sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—Oh, Antony!—No, I’ll take you too.
Sit down and eat, and welcome to our table.
Will you cry?
So she is drowned.
Tell her to put her mind at rest.
Follow her.
Why shouldn’t I?
It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do.
Keep beating, my heart, and muscles, don’t grow old yet—keep me standing.
Yes, by God!
Then my children will probably be illegitimate.
That’s why I’ve begged him to come on our shift tonight, so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it.
By our beards (if we had them), you are a knave.
Farewell.
But we already swore, sir.
Please go away, both of you.
Please, young sir.
You knew that my sword, weakened by my love for you, would obey that love no matter what. 
Goodbye!
Who do you think?
At least it’s possible in Denmark. 
Some startling news has just arrived, sir.
Please, who?
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started.
Have you ever cured anyone this way before?
We’ve driven him all the way back to his camp.
Caesar, I have news about Menecrates and Menas, notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships.
I love to argue with him when he’s having one of these fits, because then he always has a lot to say.
Here and now I seem like Antony, but I can’t keep myself in this form, my boy.
Ah, all you up in heaven!
What would you like, Laertes?
It’s the death of half the world. 
If it’s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife, it’s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who’s faithful.
What should we say, my lord?
You’ll make me angry.
Yes, my lord.
Rogue, you’ve lived too long!
Well, sir, it’s true it came soon after.
There is no jewel like Rosalind.
I’ve been informed by certain sources I can’t disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise.
Love?
There is much to be learned from these converts. 
This repays me.
What can I do for my lord?
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius will go by sea, but we’ll keep the bulk on land.
I’ve wanted to see you for a long time now, but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away.
He’s gone?
Oh, you  If you want to praise Caesar, just say his name—that’s all the praise that’s necessary.
And so, my words and thoughts will be at odds.
But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman.
Is that how it’s going to be?
That was a fine fanfare, boys.
But will my Rosalind do this, too?
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together, don’t you?
Between whom?
No, my lord.
No thank you, my lord.
Do you remember her face?
That’s what I’m doing.
But quiet, be quiet a minute.
And what’s the point, sir?
Our guiding light is out.
Can’t you see that?
Look how politely it’s pointing you to a place that’s farther away.
If you close the doors on a woman’s wit, it’ll fly out the window.
Then he says I didn’t return some ships he loaned me.
My friends told me as much, and I knew it, too.
Let’s proceed.
Good idea.
Do you know whom you’re talking to?
Madam, hurry as fast as you can get out of my court.
When did she send you?
We’ll be married tomorrow.
He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then: under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back.
So they are possibly Antony’s friends.
Come, explain.
But don’t be too tame, either—let your good sense guide you.
My dear master, my captain, my sovereign, let me say before I strike this fatal blow: farewell.
You too.
Very humid, I can’t tell you how humid it is.
What are you going to do?
Calm down.
Indeed, my lord.
Good Enobarbus, consider yourself my guest as long as you’re here.
I’m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want.
Madam!
I’ll get there.
Very pale, sir.
Draw your trustworthy sword, which you have used in such service to your country.
Listen, listen!
That’s the point.
But don’t go.
Remember you!
Such exercise!
So it’s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear.
What is, my lord?
Gentlemen, I hope you are well.
And now I’ll do it. 
He discovered that the man was his older brother.
Anyway, what’s up?
Okay.
Always give him his way.
Sir, you and I must part company—no, that’s not it.
Is this true?
But Audrey, there’s a boy in the forest who claims you’re his girl.
You must be ready for revenge, too, when you hear me out.
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain.
Please, tell me some of them.
There was no end to his generosity.
No, Orlando, men are like April when they’re wooing a girl—young, and passionate—but like December once they’re married and their passions have cooled.
You’ve never thought of me like that, and you have no reason to.
Leave.
Not really, unless you were ugly.
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling?
Did you notice?
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows.
As for this ghost we just saw, he’s a real one, I can tell you that much.
Oh, Hamlet, how far she fell!
I could do without another toast.
They fled toward Peloponnesus.
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows, though shot by enemies, could not?
Less than a month after my father’s death, even before the tears on her cheeks had dried, she remarried.
Oh, Antony, you extravagantly generous man, how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold!
Yours are slow and awkward.
Come, let’s have one more extravagant night.
To hell with you!
But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls.
Even though half of him is like a 
What’s that noise?
His ships are maneuverable.
He did this in public?
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you.
You opposed my taking part in the war.
I haven’t done anything to you.
I’ll wait till his beard grows in, if you’ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on.
Quiet!
No.
You’d better not make that suggestion, Agrippa.
What do you mean?
