Here, madam.
Speak, Agrippa.
Mine nightingale, We have beat them to their beds.
But where was this?
O God, Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
But is all this for your father?
A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
A whole one, I.
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
Where have you this?
Many times, madam.
Well said.
Woo’t fight?
Come thee on.
What were his marks?
And I for Rosalind.
Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly, as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not loved.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
No more, no more.
Your loves, as mine to you.
I would thou hadst told me of another father.
Have I the aspic in my lips?
At land, thou know’st How much we do o’ercount thee.
Hail, Caesar, and my lord!
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides.
Antony will use his affection where it is.
Your brother—no, no brother—yet the son— Yet not the son, I will not call him son— Of him I was about to call his father Hath heard your praises, and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie, And you within it.
By and by.
Oh, that I were a fool!
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
I’ll bring thee word Straight how ’tis like to go.
How goes it here?
So to them both.
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
Tell him I would speak with him.
Methinks I hear Antony call.
No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
It is to be all made of sighs and tears, And so am I for Phoebe.
He’s speaking now, Or murmuring “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?” For so he calls me.
Excellent, i' faith, of the chameleon’s dish.
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Make me not offended In your distrust.
But soft, behold!
Take up the bodies.
And, as you said (and wisely was it said) 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother— Since nature makes them partial—should o'erhear The speech, of vantage.
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?
Come away, away.
Why,
Now fear I this will give it start again.
I can behold no longer.
I thank it.
She’s dead, my Queen.
How intend you, “practiced”?
I will requite your loves.
My lord, you once did love me.
This quarry cries on havoc.
Come your ways.
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably.
Madam?
He hath assembled Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus, Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont; Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King Of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia, With a more larger list of scepters.
Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.
The odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon.
But to Orlando: did he leave him there, Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
Ay, my lord.
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness.
Here, my good lord.
Lights, lights, lights!
A mighty strength they carry.
You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior.
This was but as a fly by an eagle.
To the seaside straightway!
Mad call I it, for, to define true madness, What is ’t but to be nothing else but mad?
Call him in.
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
Another hit.
We had much more monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
I will bandy with thee in faction.
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.
What it should be, More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him So much from th' understanding of himself, I cannot dream of.
Here at your service.
And friends with Caesar.
Come on.
Fair sir, I pity her And wish, for her sake more than for mine own, My fortunes were more able to relieve her.
I partly feel thee.
Farewell.
He’s married, madam.
Lead me.
We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s Draw lots who shall begin.
But since he is better we have therefore odds.
Perchance?
My master, and my lord!
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
Let us bear him  To th’ court of guard.
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, Keep his brain fuming.
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s.
Go seek him.
I have done my duty.
Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.
Let your wedding be tomorrow.
That hath made him mad.
He is descried.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
I loved Ophelia.
Phoebe, with all my heart.
Fall not a tear, I say.
Do they grow rusty?
Therefore let’s follow.
Come on, then.
Friends, come hither.
No, some of it is for my child’s father.
You lack a man’s heart.
I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be When thou liest howling.  
Oh, fie, fie, fie!
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
Let no fair be kept in mind But the fair of Rosalind.
Speak to us.
You have broken The article of your oath, which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with.
Some o’ their plants are ill-rooted already.
My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?
Wast born i' th' forest here?
Now my spirit is going.
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave, A minister of her will.
Rosalind is your love’s name?
I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment.
I thank you, sir.
The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear.
But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.
Oh, wonderful!
It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
This is my treasurer.
Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart.
Grace grow where those drops fall!
Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveler returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of?
How “strangely”?
No, good mother.
Lay her i' th' earth, And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring!
The king my father?!
It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.
How far’st thou, soldier?
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.
I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings.
Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground. 
Now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine.
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
Gentle madam, no.
That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
Are you he?
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him.
For the best turn i’ th’ bed.
I am pale, Charmian.
Be of good cheer, youth.
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.
I say, we will have no more marriages.
Oh, speak of that.
Sure it is hers.
Do you believe his “tenders,” as you call them?
All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind.
If she be a traitor, Why so am I.
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o'erraught on the way.
Do you not know I am a woman?
But Oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man’s eyes.
Say this becomes him— As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish—yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
Adieu.
Who was last with them?
Who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain’s captain; and ambition, The soldier’s virtue, rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him.
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him.
You lie up to the hearing of the gods.
There, My music playing far off, I will betray Tawny-finned fishes.
Dost fall?
We are friends.
Thou hast railed on thyself.
But there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for ’t.
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
We came hither to fight with you.
Tis here.
Saw who?
Thou bleed’st apace.
Well then, sustain me.
Madam, he’s well.
The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack.
In happy time.
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me. 
Mend the instance, shepherd.
The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.
There, Diomed, there.
Do not fear our person.
Come, sweet Audrey.
For my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.
There I deny my land service.
Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells, you know, are greasy.
Provoke not battle Till we have done at sea.
How does the queen?
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.
Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros.
My resolution’s placed, and I have nothing Of woman in me.
Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
Our severed navy too Have knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sealike.
Riotous madness, To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing!
Tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon.
Yes, sir.
Or I do forget myself?
By my faith, you have great reason to be sad.
Call to me All my sad captains.
A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own.
Therefore prepare thyself.
You think of him too much.
I warrant you, madam.
She creeps.
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel, That he his high authority abused And did deserve his change.
Pray you, hasten Your generals after.
You, cousin.
If it be so as so ’tis put on me— And that in way of caution—I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor.
Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
Come.
This business is well ended.
Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter.
When the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
They steal hearts.
Cleopatra, Do not abuse my master’s bounty by Th’ undoing of yourself.
The rest shall keep as they are.
My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.
O sir, pardon me!
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune, He is twenty men to one.
You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.
He’s bound unto Octavia.
Ho, let the door be locked.
I knew your father.
Tis too narrow for your mind.
Fare you well.
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
The soldier’s pole is fall’n!
Me believe it?
Your lips will feel them the sooner.
Call!
Wilt thou not answer, man?
Good Enobarbus!
Lives he?
News, my good lord, from Rome.
O my good lord, Believe not all, or, if you must believe, Stomach not all.
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.
How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge?
What said he?
With news the time’s with labor, and throws forth Each minute some.
What wilt thou do for her?
Like her?
All’s but naught.
Sailors, my lord, they say.
If it be not to come, it will be now.
There’s hope in ’t yet.
I pray you, rise.
Be of good cheer.
Sir, good success.
Oh, quick, or I am gone.
I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.
A ripe age.
He hath fought today As if a god, in hate of mankind, had Destroyed in such a shape.
All is not well.
It is as easy as lying.
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation?
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest, Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot In his own conduct, purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword.
Why, what else?
Sweet masters, be patient.
Ophelia, walk you here.
Sit.
But you’ll be secret?
Question it, Horatio.
And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part.
I should have known no less.
That you did fear is done.
Therefore no more but to the matter.
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia, Where Caesar fought with Pompey.
O my lord!
I think so too.
Take no offense that I would not offend you.
Who, queasy with his insolence already, Will their good thoughts call from him. 
I know I cannot please you.
O wonderful son that can so ’stonish a mother!
Tis but one cast away, and so, come, death.
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?
I do not know what “poetical” is.
Gentle Octavia, Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it.
We have kissed away Kingdoms and provinces.
I shall obey, my lord.
No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt.
For that you must But say I could not help it.
I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are disposed to be merry.
Was ’t you he rescued?
How now, lady?
A very fine one.
The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she Will yield us up?
What shall we do, Enobarbus?
What needs more words?
Behold this man.
As thou'rt a man, Give me the cup.
Let us go.
Wherefore is that?
How now, worthy soldier?
I mean, my head upon your lap?
There are the players.
Thus Rosalind of many parts By heavenly synod was devised, Of many faces, eyes, and hearts To have the touches dearest prized.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
I stay too long.
Be witness to me, O thou blessèd moon, When men revolted shall upon record Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did Before thy face repent.
But that they call “compliment” is like th' encounter of two dog- apes.
And yet it is not: it is but so-so.
What’s your name?
If we be not relieved within this hour, We must return to th’ court of guard.
Within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives.
If he filled His vacancy with his voluptuousness, Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for ’t.
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Let us go.
I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
Give you good night.
I warrant your honor.
Wherein we saw thee quietly interred, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again.
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
We are for you.
Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
Oh, ’tis treason!
I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad— and to travel for it, too.
There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th' arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. 
Who doth he gallop withal?
My very hairs do mutiny, for the white Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them For fear and doting.
What is ’t, my lord?
In faith, my lord, not I.
I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn.
Why then, your ambition makes it one.
Let her be round with him, And I’ll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference.
To him will I.
For not alone The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, Do strongly speak to us, but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home.
I’ll tell you who time ambles withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.
Our force by land Hath nobly held.
He would not have spoke such a word.
Let me go with you.
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say The gods themselves do weep!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam.
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial.
If thou pleasest not, I yield thee up my life.
Wherefore?
I would I were at home.
Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!
Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.
Ah, this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on ’t!
Briefly, sir.
To a nunnery, go. 
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
I did not see him since.
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead.
It is backed like a weasel.
Sweets to the sweet.
I have more cause.
Thou shalt Go back, I warrant thee!
Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
How dost thou, Charles?
Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.
Let him appear that’s come from Antony.
Crowner’s quest law.
Stay, give me drink.—Hamlet, this pearl is thine.
Where’s the Queen?
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Why should he follow?
Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument.
Peace, peace, Iras.
What players are they?
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
Let’s mock the midnight bell.
This health to Lepidus!
At land indeed Thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house, But since the cuckoo builds not for himself, Remain in ’t as thou mayst.
I looked her in the face, and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony.
Now might I do it pat.
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?
O Iras, Charmian!
How comes it?
Tomorrow, Before the sun shall see ’s, we’ll spill the blood That has today escaped.
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, Invited her to supper.
Fare you well, my liege.
Why should he not?
Tis sweating labor To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this.
The like is on her arm.
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea!
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
What ceremony else?
It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wished until he were, And the ebbed man, ne’er loved till ne’er worth love, Comes deared by being lacked.
Your honor calls you hence.
Tomorrow, Caesar, I shall be furnished to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time.
Here’s more news.
Who is ’t that can inform me?
Fear it, Ophelia.
Here’s to thee, Menas!
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court.
Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction.
O, he is mad, Laertes.
What said he?
How heavy weighs my lord!
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous.
They are so still, Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, Art turned the greatest liar.
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
I am dying, Egypt, dying.
He bears The third part of the world, man.
Who stays it still withal?
Denmark’s a prison.
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
Twill not be seen in him there.
Look you, sad friends, The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings.
But here comes Antony.
I know you are not ignorant— I would you did, sir.
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' th' earth?
So he laughed and let me go.
But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
Go to, go to.—Come hither, sir.
The moblèd queen”?
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Look where they come.
It is a poison tempered by himself.
Not a jot more, my lord.
They bleed on both sides.—How is it, my lord?
Sooth, la, I’ll help.
I make not, but foresee.
Royal wench!
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.
Tell me where it is.
Canidius and the rest That fell away have entertainment but No honorable trust.
If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son, As you have whispered faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither.
Assist, good friends.
I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony.
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her.
You have heard much.
Why, because he was mad.
Nay, I have done.
I will be treble-sinewed, -hearted, -breathed, And fight maliciously.
Peace!
The wiser, the waywarder.
Wast ever in court, shepherd?
I have seen nothing.
Happy, in that we are not overhappy.
But, by 'r Lady, he must build churches then, or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is “For, oh, for, oh, the hobby-horse is forgot.”      What means this, my lord?
But take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
So he served the second, and so the third.
Cleopatra— Why should I think you can be mine, and true— Though you in swearing shake the thronèd gods— Who have been false to Fulvia?
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.
I eat the air, promise-crammed.
I am paid for ’t now.
Oh, dispatch me!
Ay, my lord.
You are a fool.—You, niece, provide yourself.
Under the earth.
The king rises.
For us, you know Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s.
Is it not strange, Canidius, That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne?—You have heard on ’t, sweet?
The duke my father loved his father dearly.
Let’s withdraw, my lord.
Gertrude, do not drink.
He will to his Egyptian dish again.
Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it As answering to the weight.
Enough to purchase what you have made known.
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough.
Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own.
The gods forbid!
By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly.
Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee And make thy fortunes proud.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
The music, ho!
But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire!
Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully returned.
She is cunning past man’s thought.
For this relief much thanks.
An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
Ay, very well, my lord.
I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes.— Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.
Have you had quiet guard?
Go, And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find of her.
O come, Ventidius.
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets.
My lord approaches.
Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.
Now counterfeit to swoon, why, now fall down; Or if thou canst not, Oh, for shame, for shame, Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
Let them come in.
Ay, noble lord.
O, give me leave.
Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well— But what care I for words?
For he partly begs To be desired to give.
It shall to the barber’s, with your beard.—Prithee, say on.
But let it be.
Brief let me be.
So it should be, that none but Antony Should conquer Antony, but woe ’tis so!
Tis very strange.
Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
Thou art The armorer of my heart.
What, girl, though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha’ we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth.
Oh, this is the poison of deep grief.
But is this law?
Get thee to a nunnery, go.
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
Ha, ha, are you honest?
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
I will say so.
They are winged.
He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall.
Yare, yare, good Iras, quick.
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.
Good shepherd, tell this youth what ’tis to love.
Are you fair?
Oh that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands!
Oh, come apace, dispatch!
Who can come in and say that I mean her, When such a one as she such is her neighbor?
Be as ourself in Denmark.—Madam, come.
What, of death too, That rids our dogs of languish?
Brutus killed me. 
Bear him away.
And begged he pardon?
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun, and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
Amen.
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra.
But forbear, I say.
Not to be endured.
Where?
Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.
One ever near thee.
Farewell, great chief.
Tis gone.
Let Rome be thus informed.
His death’s upon him, but not dead.
You have too courtly a wit for me.
Tis yours, and we, Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall Hang in what place you please.
And here much Orlando.
Didst thou behold Octavia?
The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for ’t.
Tis most true, And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.
Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honor.
I pray you.
Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end Assemble we immediate council.
The article of my oath?
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
Upon my honor— Then came each actor on his ass—
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offense too.
As it ebbs, the seedsman Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain, And shortly comes to harvest.
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty but kindly.
You’re fall’n into a princely hand.
Let me go, I say.
Bid them all fly, For when I am revenged upon my charm, I have done all.
Seafaring men, sir.
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt— Whom leprosy o’ertake!—i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight, When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same, or rather ours the elder, The breeze upon her, like a cow in June, Hoists sails and flies.
How if I answer “No”?
Dost thou hear?
Then is the world one.
Show me the place.
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
Nay then, I’ll run.
Very well.
He’s as good at anything and yet a fool.
Most certain.
He did comply, sir, with his dug before he sucked it.
All the East, Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded, And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed, Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him.
And why, sir, must they so?
I have led you oft; carry me now, good friends, And have my thanks for all.
My father—methinks I see my father.
God save you, sir!
Good night.
My lord, I did intend it.
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home With clouts about their heads.
I humbly thank you, sir.
Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation.
Under a compelling occasion, let women die.
He goes forth gallantly.
Cheerly, good Adam. 
The king and queen and all are coming down.
Why, then, we kill all our women.
What should this mean?
Thither will I invite the duke and all’s contented followers.
If thou say so, villain, Thou kill’st thy mistress.
Here comes the king, The queen, the courtiers—who is this they follow, And with such maimèd rites?
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
Our hour  Is fully out.
Anon, as patient as the female dove When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.
A proper man.
Marry, I’ll teach you.
Oh, but she is wise.
To die, to sleep.
Draw and come.
So, This is to horse.
The players cannot keep counsel.
I pray you tell me your remedy.
Oh, temperance, lady!
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points?
Dead, then?
Whip him, fellows, Till like a boy, you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy.
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarreling, drabbing—you may go so far.
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent.
What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither?
This is called “the countercheck quarrelsome,” and so to “the lie circumstantial” and “the lie direct.”  And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando.
No, hath not?
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.
Swounds, show me what thou'lt do.
Oh, a good wish upon you.
Shall I abide In this dull world, which in thy absence is No better than a sty?
And shall I couple hell?
Or else she could not have the wit to do this.
Turn from me then that noble countenance Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
My purposes do draw me much about.
I’ll leave you, lady.
And the business you have broached here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt, And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean’st to have him grant thee.
And I mine.
Caesar, I shall.
I knew what you would prove.
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her.
You shall not go, my lord.
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
Well, well, We shall thrive now.—Seest thou, my good fellow?
Think and die.
Is the single man therefore blessed?
Tis exactly valued, Not petty things admitted.
The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court?
Come, the recorders!
Farewell.
Pronounce.
I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you.
What’s thy name?
I must with haste from hence.
I did love you once.
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her.
I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.
He’s fat, and scant of breath.— Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
May one be pardoned and retain th' offense?
Still am I called.—Unhand me, gentlemen.
I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey, For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me.
Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little.
Two o'clock is your hour? 
Then learn this of me: to have is to have.
Now, by my sword—                                              And target.
Both he loves.
Let me hear Agrippa further speak.
There’s a strong fellow, Menas.
Pray heaven I be deceived in you.
Words, words, words.
If ever he go alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more.
Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be—drunk to bed.   
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast—and but twelve persons there!
Whilst he stood up and spoke, He was my master, and I wore my life To spend upon his haters.
Welcome.
Unarm, Eros.
Note him, Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man, but note him.
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion.
I think so, Charmian.
Too late, good Diomed.
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me.
Or rather bottomless, that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out. 
When Roscius was an actor in Rome—  The actors are come hither, my lord.
O good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world, When service sweat for duty, not for meed.
There is more in it.—Cousin Ganymede.
Is it a true thing?
But your news is not true.
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides.
Die when thou hast lived.
Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things.
So be it.
I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar’s trencher.
Pooh, you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Your betters, sir.
Do this suddenly, And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways.
Even here Do we shake hands.
Should I lie, madam?
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.
By this marriage, All little jealousies, which now seem great, And all great fears, which now import their dangers, Would then be nothing.
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
A traveler.
I will, my lord.
What, are the brothers parted?
All there is thine.
What noise is that?
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?
All may be well enough.
Arise, you shall not kneel.
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
She shows a body rather than a life, A statue than a breather.
Take your time.
Do you see this, O God?
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ.
Monsieur the challenger, the Princess calls for you.
Think it no more.
Avaunt!
Madam, I heard her speak.
What is it ye would see?
What think you on ’t?
Be attentive.
Ay.—Fare you well, fair gentleman.
I’ll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities.
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
Is thy union here?
Counterfeit, I assure you.
Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be choked with such another emphasis!
Hold, worthy lady, hold!
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another.
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
Give me leave, Caesar.
I am so.
O, O, O, O.
Or is he on his horse?
This, this.
Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy, yet t’ imagine An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy, Condemning shadows quite. 
Call the slave again.
Of all the days i' the year, I came to ’t that day that our last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
Why, what a king is this!
You must sing  This nothing’s more than matter.
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows.
You do mistake your business.
Go and say We purpose her no shame.
Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water?
I am fire and air, my other elements I give to baser life.—So, have you done?
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition.
And why not the swift foot of time?
And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part.
So much for him.
If you’ll patch a quarrel, As matter whole you have to make it with, It must not be with this.
Faith, her privates we.
I will.
Hold off thy hand.
I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behavior.
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
Oh, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursèd head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!
Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness.
But, sir, forgive me, Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you.
Pray ye, sir?
Tis here.
Fare-well.
Nothing.
Give me the cups.
By my life I do, which I tender dearly, though I say I am a magician.
Thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable Where Caesar’s is not.
Pray you Be ever known to patience.
No.
Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been all this day to look you.
As a walled town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor.
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me.
Let me see—what think you of falling in love?
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers.
Avoid, and leave him.
Fortune and Antony part here.
Besides, I like you not.
He saves my labor by his own approach.
Where wilt thou lead me?
I know you could not lack, I am certain on ’t, Very necessity of this thought, that I, Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought, Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace.
I dare not drink yet, madam.
No, sir.
No matter whither, so you come not here.
My sword is drawn.
Let her know ’t.—   And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities.
Trust not to rotten planks.
In me ’tis villainy, In thee ’t had been good service.
It is not very strange.
Is it a man?
She Phoebes me.
Oh, fie!
They have made him drink alms-drink.
The time is come.
The Queen, my lord, the Queen.
Off, pluck off!
Tis true.
On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did.
What was ’t That moved pale Cassius to conspire?
Whip him.
At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek, But at fourscore, it is too late a week.
Speak to her, Hamlet.
Here comes two of the banished duke’s pages.
Ay, ay.
Heaven make thee free of it.
Come, bird, come.
O earth!
Yes, one, and in this manner.
What’s that?
I would know that.
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in ’s own house.
Where’s Antony?
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
Tis spoken well.
Wilt thou, Silvius?
It shall do well.
Why, whither shall we go?
Ay, and twenty such.
You are full of pretty answers.
I am satisfied.
Farewell, farewell.
My father’s spirit in arms.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Caesar, I shall.
Nay, come, let’s go together.
Come, away.
Thou must know, ’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor; Mine honor, it.
Come hither, come!
O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
Good my lord— You have been a boggler ever.
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
Dispatch.—O love, That thou couldst see my wars today, and knew’st The royal occupation!
Fare you well.
Go put on thy defenses.
Tomorrow is the day.
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
Your wife and brother Made wars upon me, and their contestation Was theme for you.
My lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head.
He dreams.
It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she From Egypt drive her all-disgracèd friend Or take his life there.
He attends here in the forest on the duke your father.
Thou an Egyptian puppet shalt be shown In Rome, as well as I.
If thou didst ever thy dear father love— O God!
Where hast thou been, my heart?
Wherefore is this?
My good lord.
Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral, And then to Rome.
I will do ’t.
What man dost thou dig it for?
What, man?
I am not married, Caesar.
I do not well understand that.
Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.
Why, he had none.
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
Why, there’s more gold.
True, sir.
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.
God be wi' you, sir.
Assume a virtue if you have it not.
Dolabella!
What shall be our sport, then?
Their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow.
It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
Her head’s declined, and death will seize her but Your comfort makes the rescue.
At home, my lord.
Why, now, as fast as she can marry us.
Are you his brother?
Must there no more be done?
Go a little before.
Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her.
It is offended.
O God, your only jig-maker.
Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
Your crown’s awry.
Peace, you dull fool.
But these offers, Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off, And so should you.
Think not I love him, though I ask for him.
Oh, then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us Is as our earing.
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress.
Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
Is there no offense in ’t?
Wilt thou know Th' effect of what I wrote?
If we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them.
Stand close and list him.
Leave me alone to woo him.
Most shallow man.
Tis he.
I think it lacks of twelve.
His leg is but so-so—and yet ’tis well.
What mean you, madam?
What hour now?
Sir?
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.
So, Dolabella, It shall content me best.
Judgment?
It will be short.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Give me some music.
Master, go on, and I will follow thee To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
Our will is Antony be took alive.
He was a goodly king.
Take but good note, and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transformed Into a strumpet’s fool.
Much is breeding  Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life, And not a serpent’s poison.
Avoid what is to come.
We did, my lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer.
I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me.
Five-and-twenty, sir.
By Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right.
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Antony, Leave thy lascivious wassails.
We see how mortal an unkindness is to them.
Bring him, dead or living, Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory.
Peace!
Round, even to faultiness.
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself.
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?
He does well to commend it himself.
Therefore thou liest.
Nay, I hope.
The messenger Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now Unloading of his mules.
Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment, Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts.
O my son, what theme?
Is it not past two o'clock?
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
By heaven, I’ll have ’t.
Ay, my lord.
The king, sir— Ay, sir, what of him?
That cannot be, since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder: My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
Rarely, rarely.
I am tame, sir.
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale Her infinite variety.
At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him.
Well, get thee gone.
What says Polonius?
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.
I have been told so of many.
Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were graveled for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
On.
The power of Caesar, and His power unto Octavia.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
Come, come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars!
Go, Eros, send his treasure after.
He wore his beaver up.
If he come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment.
We will haste us.
Farewell.
The itch of his affection should not then Have nicked his captainship at such a point When half to half the world opposed, he being The merèd question.
Come, go we to the king.
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.
God 'ild you, sir.
Shall we be sundered?
Besides, he brings his destiny with him.
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute.
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome.
I’ll mend it and then play— Where’s the Queen?
Go to, I’ll no more on ’t.
Will you go?
Approach and speak.
No, I will go seek Some ditch wherein to die.
But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration?
What can it not?
Let him speak, my lord, Upon his peril, that I have reserved To myself nothing.
O heavy deed!
Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulcher,
Tis well for thee That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt.
Doth my simple feature content you?
It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion and all made of wishes, All adoration, duty, and observance, All humbleness, all patience and impatience, All purity, all trial, all observance, And so am I for Phoebe.
Nay, he hath but a little beard.
For love of God, forbear him.
Without contradiction I have heard that.
I’ll none now.
Let’s meet as little as we can.
Come.
Say our pleasure, To such whose place is under us, requires Our quick remove from hence.
There I shall see mine own figure.
God make incision in thee; thou art raw.
Remember me.
Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I.
That head, my lord?
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast, That sucks the nurse asleep?
Ay, my lord.
Had my lips that power, Thus would I wear them out.
This is too long.
But near him thy angel Becomes afeard, as being o’erpowered.
You’ve strange serpents there?
I dreamt there was an emperor Antony.
O vengeance!
Give me audience, good madam.
Sir, a whole history.
If not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.
You’ll win two days upon me.
O’er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me.
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.
Let our officers Have notice what we purpose.
Wilt thou rest damned?
Write to him— I will subscribe—gentle adieus and greetings.
He says so.
A simple countryman that brought her figs.
That’s very true, my lord.
Believe none of us.
Good friend,” quoth he, “Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster, at whose foot, To mend the petty present, I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms.
I thank you for your company, but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
And so am I revenged.—That would be scanned.
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
Is this true?
She shall be buried by her Antony.
And all for nothing— For Hecuba!
Madam, he’s married to Octavia.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.
But you are no such man.
Pompey is strong at sea, And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar.
Say what, is Horatio there?
Oh, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.
We do, my lord.
Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Let him not leave out The color of her hair.
We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes.
Since he went from Egypt ’tis A space for farther travel.
Be a child o’ th’ time.
For your desire to know what is between us, O'ermaster ’t as you may.
Was ’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
Those his goodly eyes, That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front.
This foul Egyptian hath betrayèd me.
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combinèd locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.
Sweet, say on.
I’ll not fail, if I live.
When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire?
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
Hear the ambassadors.
The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath, And in the cup an union shall he throw Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark’s crown have worn.
Nay, pray be covered.
Here comes Sir Oliver.—Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met.
Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.
I have a health for you.
We’ll ha ’t tomorrow night.
Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation.
Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now, By reason of his absence, there is nothing That you will feed on.
Faith, there has been much to do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy.
Leave me, I pray, a little.
If he do blench, I know my course.
Those that are married already, all but one, shall live.
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
Oh, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
And indeed it takes From our achievements, though performed at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute.
Well, I know not What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face, But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal.
Cry “holla” to thy tongue, I prithee.
I would they’d fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air, We’d fight there too.
I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband.
We shall find a time, Audrey.
Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court, Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia.
Will you go, coz?
The honor is sacred which he talks on now, Supposing that I lacked it.—But, on, Caesar.
Thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee quickly.
Where is he?
I have myself resolved upon a course Which has no need of you.
Farewell.
The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me.—Good old man, Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Now I see, I see, In Fulvia’s death how mine received shall be.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.
Not till you have slept.
My uncle?
Come, warble, come.
But he sleeps.
Scant not my cups, and make as much of me As when mine empire was your fellow too, And suffered my command.
Come hither, Proculeius.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
What warlike noise is this?
Go you and prepare Aliena, for look you, here comes my Rosalind.
I am glad of it.
We’ll know all our fortunes.
Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice.
Nay, the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven, Raised by your populous troops.
In what, my dear lord?
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in excellence, but to know a man well were to know himself.
My name is Proculeius.
Haste me to know ’t, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.
Why do people love you?
In Sicyon.
Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey.—I attend, I attend.
Once more remove, good friends.
See it done And feast the army.
Lady!
But if we fail, We then can do ’t at land.
I can no more.
Farewell.
If he be absent, bring his brother to me.
Slanders, sir.
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so, But kindness, nobler ever than revenge, And nature, stronger than his just occasion, Made him give battle to the lioness, Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling, From miserable slumber I awaked.
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man.
Caesar’s sister is called Octavia.
And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?
My more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia’s death.
The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance.
Peace.—Who comes here?
Perform ’t, or else we damn thee.”                                                                     How, my love?
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras.
Saw you my lord?
There’s my cap.
Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard.
Well, sir?
I think I hear them.—Stand, ho!
Why, how now, Adam?
Why, how now, Charmian?
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
Take the hint Which my despair proclaims.
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
So is the fame.
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself.
O most false love!
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted, He lessens his requests, and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens.
Declare thine office.
Sir, I never loved you much, but I ha’ praised ye When you have well deserved ten times as much As I have said you did.
Perchance 'Twill walk again.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
I thank you; and be blessed for your good comfort.
It may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit.
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st.
Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd. 
You do remember all the circumstance?
No, lady.
Tis in my memory locked, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Pray you, no more of this.
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight.
Good my lord.
Which is he that killed the deer?
Here on her breast There is a vent of blood, and something blown.
The king, the king’s to blame.
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
Though it be honest, it is never good To bring bad news.
I pray you, tell it.
Caesar hath sent—                                        Too slow a messenger.
If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires, If that I do not dream or be not frantic— As I do trust I am not—then, dear uncle, Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness.
Or does he walk?
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do.
And then, sir, does he this, he does— What was I about to say?
Is that his answer?
No.
And indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase.
If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye, to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you.
To th’ monument!
We will here part.
Hamlet, thou art slain.
Follow my mother.
No, madam.
Sir, Mark Antony Will e’en but kiss Octavia, and we’ll follow.
Not now to hear thee sing.
But this is most falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say “Wit, whither wilt?”  Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wife’s wit going to your neighbor’s bed.
My salad days, When I was green in judgment, cold in blood, To say as I said then.
Peace, peace!
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind; Such a nut is Rosalind.
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
Then shall we be news-crammed.
Ay, good my lord.
I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock- pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey.
So do all thoughts.
Speak to me home.
So Fulvia told me.
Come, my lord.
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother’s commandment.
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother, From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother.
Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.
Sir, this should be answered.
For that he dares us to ’t.
Nay, come, again.
Thanks, dear my lord.
I’ll tell thee, Charles: it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
Is not that neighborly?
I doubt it is no other but the main: His father’s death and our o'erhasty marriage.
I wish, forbear.
Will you go, sister?—Shepherd, ply her hard.
Fly?
Will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
Hail to your lordship.
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
So, fare thee well.
I’ll have grounds More relative than this.
All come to this?
Her worth being mounted on the wind, Through all the world bears Rosalind.
Had I before known this young man his son, I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventured.
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
No more but so?
You have my consent.
He calls me “boy” and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt.
But yet, madam— I do not like “But yet.” It does allay The good precedence.
I shall not look upon his like again.
Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her If she refuse me.
There are no tongues else for ’s turn.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want Of what I was i’ th’ morning.
All dead.
Now, I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
Where dwell you, pretty youth?
As well as I can, madam.
Is ’t possible?
Farewell, good Charles.
Who does me this?
Jove, Jove, this shepherd’s passion Is much upon my fashion.
Good morrow to your Worship.
Sink Rome!
I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal.
How is ’t, my noble lord?
My tables!—Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.
That’s our offer.
I cannot live to hear the news from England.
But upon the fairest boughs, Or at every sentence end, Will I “Rosalinda” write, Teaching all that read to know The quintessence of every sprite Heaven would in little show.
Make you a wholesome answer.
He calls us back.
The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.
Prithee, friend, Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, The good and bad together.
Who’s born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar.
Is yonder the man?
Let’s speak to him.
Farewell.
And I have been all this day to avoid him.
There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their barks, hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind.
Why did you laugh then, when I said “man delights not me”?
No more light answers.
So long?
I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant.
Murder?
Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
God be wi' you.
You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue.
Tis noble spoken.
My lord, we will not.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
He received them Of him that brought them.
How now?
You jig and amble, and you lisp, you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance.
Coldhearted toward me?
I overheard him and his practices.
I repent me much That so I harried him.
So our leader’s led, And we are women’s men.
Farewell.
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.
I did enact Julius Caesar.
Sir, my good friend, I’ll change that name with you.
To me it is a prison.
I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
How shall I answer you?
Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall t' expel the winter’s flaw!
And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, Give me one poor request.
We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
Leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her.
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.
Dispatch.—Enobarbus!
Come.
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
I will to Egypt.
Ay, my good lord.
And they that are most gallèd with my folly, They most must laugh.
I care not if I have.
Do you doubt that?
All the better.
He may recover yet. 
I was too young that time to value her, But now I know her.
O eastern star!
Take him for all in all.
Treachery!
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth, Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Shall we part, sweet girl?
Thou know’st ’tis common.
Shall we see this wrestling, cousin? 
Lepidus flatters both, Of both is flattered, but he neither loves, Nor either cares for him.
Believe what?
And when that time comes, Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not, As till that time I shall not pity thee.
Nay, it is.
Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat?
It does, my lord.
By heaven, I charge thee, speak.
And may, through all the world!
Pray you, look not sad, Nor make replies of loathness.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here livèd I, but now live here no more.
Why, what an ass am I!
Here comes the Emperor.
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
It hath made me mad.
Oh, he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own!
Those that do die of it do seldom or never recover. 
To what base uses we may return, Horatio.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief: your noble son is mad.
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
Oh, that your Highness knew my heart in this: I never loved my brother in my life.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Take hence this jack and whip him.
To die, to sleep— No more—and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to—’tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished!
The story is extant, and writ in choice Italian.
Good morrow, General.
I have seen you both.
Alexas!
It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler’s heels and your heart both in an instant.
Till which encounter It is my business too.
Great and increasing.
With what, i' th' name of God?
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?
Call him.
What’s this for?
Hence, saucy eunuch!
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
Let this be so.
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field.
Repent that e’er thy tongue Hath so betrayed thine act.
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away.
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows.
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
For when mine hours Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives Of me for jests; but now I’ll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me.
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
But I’ll catch thine eyes, Though they had wings.
How now, daughter and cousin?
If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into, Thou hast not loved.
What might you think?
Well, God-'a'-mercy.
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
Friends, begone.
E'en so, my lord.
Shall we to th' court?
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties, dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness, who With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased, Making and marring fortunes.
Dolabella!
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?
You are merry, my lord.
He is of note.
What, what, good cheer!
But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.
Come on!
There he is.
Three in Egypt Cannot make better note.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
That’s the next to do.
All take hands.
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us, and we punish it, Seeming to bear it lightly.
Soft, comes he not here?
How do you, women?
Well, time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let time try.
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with him.
Say you so?
My honored lord!
He is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.
Who calls?
A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not—but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue.
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
Let it alone.
I will o’ertake thee, Cleopatra, and Weep for my pardon.
No, Lepidus, let him speak.
That will I, for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
Enough.
And we will mend thy wages.
Hillo, ho, ho, boy.
You shall be more beloving than beloved. 
Good my complexion, dost thou think though I am caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition?
I would sing my song without a burden.
Mine honor was not yielded, But conquered merely.
Caesar, thy thoughts Touch their effects in this.
Oh, couldst thou speak, That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied!
There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you.
The gods withhold me!
You are a fishmonger.
And so am I for Rosalind.
Adieu.
Where, my lord?
Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.
Go, get thee hence.
Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is.
And, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him.
Now, by the faith of my love, I will.
Therefore Make space enough between you.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so.
Yet he looks successfully.
Come on, sir.
The people knows it, and have now received His accusations.
Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous duke?
You have done well by water.
Put on my crown.
She’s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
I’ll board him presently.
Stay!
Alas, what danger will it be to us, Maids as we are, to travel forth so far?
We’ll go along together, And ere we have thy youthful wages spent, We’ll light upon some settled low content.
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep.
Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.
Not one to throw at a dog.
I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sirrah?
O bear me witness, night— What man is this?
But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life.
She rendered life, Thy name so buried in her.
You are too indulgent.
Alas, and woe!
Sir?
No.
Best of comfort, And ever welcome to us.
Speak softly.
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul, And all the world was of my father’s mind.
A hit, a very palpable hit.
If knife, drugs, serpents, have Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
Say that the last I spoke was “Antony,” And word it, prithee, piteously.
What stature is she of?
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose— Help me away, dear Charmian!
Is ’t possible?
This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures.
I dare not, dear, Dear my lord, pardon, I dare not, Lest I be taken.
Oh, noble weakness!
This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
For better might we Have loved without this mean, if on both parts This be not cherished.
Be’st thou sad or merry, The violence of either thee becomes, So does it no man else.—Mett’st thou my posts?
Adieu, noble Agrippa.
If he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off.
Let me have your hand.
She robs thee of thy name, And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone.
Ink and paper, Charmian.
I wish you all joy of the worm.
But we both obey And here give up ourselves, in the full bent, To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded.
Come, my spade.
Call you this railing?
Noble captain, come.
It was about to speak when the cock crew.
Go to, go to.
Neglected, rather, And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge.
It was divided Between her heart and lips.
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge.
Thyself art coming To see performed the dreaded act which thou So sought’st to hinder.
If sight and shape be true, Why then, my love adieu.
What’s your highness’ pleasure?
No, my most wrongèd sister.
By two o'clock I will be with thee again.
Downy windows, close,
O madam, madam, madam!
How may we try it further?
Cheer your heart.
Couch we a while and mark.
I shall do well.
But I can tell you that of late this duke Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece, Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father’s sake; And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth.
Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
Ay me, most wretched, That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other!
Mark how the tyrant writes.
She well instructs me.
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
O dear Phoebe, If ever—as that ever may be near— You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy, Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love’s keen arrows make.
This blows my heart.
How appears the fight?
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
We’ll speak with thee at sea.
Moon and stars!
It might, my lord.
Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here.
How do you, pretty lady?
Yet I hate not Orlando.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Do ’t.
I will not stay behind.
Know then I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer, but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience.
Well met here.
Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt.
I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.
Only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.
What’s else to say?—                                                          These quicksands, Lepidus, Keep off them, for you sink.
Ay, dread Queen.
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Look who comes here.
A charge we bear i’ th’ war, And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man.
Even so.
There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar.
Oh, that his fault should make a knave of thee, That art not what th’ art sure of!
I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself.
Hoo!
Where art thou, Death?
Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
We have used our throats in Egypt.
I mean, sir, for his weapon.
I assure my good liege, I hold my duty as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king.
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
None but friends.
Is there none here to give the woman?
The gods confound thee!
You are welcome, masters, welcome, all!—I am glad to see thee well.—Welcome, good friends.—O old friend?
The beds i’ th’ East are soft, and thanks to you, That called me timelier than my purpose hither, For I have gained by ’t.
It would be spoke to.
I rest much bounden to you.
Say boldly.
They that reap must sheaf and bind, Then to cart with Rosalind.
What means your lordship?
Come, sirs.
I would I had been there.
Marry, well said, very well said.
Mock not, Enobarbus.
What’s the matter?
Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
I will not take her on gift of any man.
I’ll mark the play.
Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
Fare thee well, dame.
The crowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial.
Royal Egypt, Empress!
Which soon he granted, Being an obstruct ’tween his lust and him.
Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness’ presence.
We should have met you By sea and land, supplying every stage With an augmented greeting.
Ay, my lord.
I do not see them bleed.
I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page, And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
O Antony, O thou Arabian bird!
Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife.
Besides, our hands are hard.
Swear by my sword.
And you by land.
A worthy pioneer!
Happily, amen!
To the vales, And hold our best advantage.
Who’s gone this morning?
I am sick and sullen.
He married but his occasion here.
Therefore weep.
We shall, my lord.
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
Let’s follow.
Virtue is no hornmaker, and my Rosalind is virtuous.
What color, madam?
Were it not better, Because that I am more than common tall, That I did suit me all points like a man?
Lie they upon thy hand And be undone by ’em!
Proculeius, What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, And he hath sent for thee.
Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine, Smarting in ling’ring pickle!
What manner of man?
Pompey Thrives in our idleness.
But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
Well, my lord.
Bring me word how tall she is.
I am glad of your departure.
Hence, Mardian, And bring me how he takes my death. 
Now boast thee, Death, in thy possession lies A lass unparalleled.
Ay, sir.
At your noble pleasure.
O, fear me not.
But how, but how?
Ay, sweet Rosalind.
Let him alone, for I remember now How he’s employed.
Follow me and receive ’t.
I’ll unhair thy head!
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that was willing to be so.
I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
Farewell.
You a man?
Come, go with me.
Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well-counterfeited.
Will you go? 
My lord, Mark Antony, Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted My grievèd ear withal, whereon I begged His pardon for return.
I can tell what thou wouldst do.
Long stayed he so.
Sit i' th' middle.
I have undone three tailors.
Cross him in nothing.
Our separation so abides and flies That thou, residing here, goes yet with me, And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
It may be, very like.
Pray you, avoid it.
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs.
Farewell.
Here lie I down and measure out my grave.
Proceed.
Come.
Tis now struck twelve.
I heard it not.
Phoebe did write it.
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for.
I am quickly ill, and well, So Antony loves.
Clubs cannot part them.
The drink, the drink!
What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very Rosalind?
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
The less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.
For learn this, Silius: Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away.
Did he receive you well?
But well and free, If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here My bluest veins to kiss—a hand that kings Have lipped, and trembled kissing.
You shall try but one fall.
I think he be transformed into a beast, For I can nowhere find him like a man.
You mock me, sir.
Why, that’s the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents.
Therefore tremble and depart.
Though to have her and death were both one thing.
Mark me.
Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him, As thus: “I know his father and his friends, And, in part, him.” Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
What follows, then, my lord?
Never talk to me.
You come not Like Caesar’s sister.
Therefore be cheered.
Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.
Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him?
Hymen from heaven brought her, Yea, brought her hither, That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is.
Behold it stained With his most noble blood.
That a maiden’s heart hath burned?
He waxes desperate with imagination.
O heavenly mingle!
Are you not good?
Come, some music!
Well, we shall sift him.—Welcome, my good friends!
Never anger Made good guard for itself.
So you may put a man in your belly.
Nay, you were a fragment Of Gneius Pompey’s, besides what hotter hours, Unregistered in vulgar fame, you have Luxuriously picked out.
Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse. 
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you.
Then so much have I heard.
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse.
Eros, thou yet behold’st me?
By my knavery (if I had it), then I were.
Was he not here?
Give to a gracious message An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt.
My wit’s diseased.
What, Octavia?
You can do better yet, but this is meetly.
He has my dying voice.
Good morrow to thee.
Or like a whale.
I pray thee, if it stand with honesty, Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock, And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
What, says the married woman you may go?
What does this mean, my lord?
What is ’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
Part them!
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son, He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks.
You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar.
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from His Majesty.
Of what color?
Come, thou mortal wretch, With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie.
What have I kept back?
Now he’ll outstare the lightning.
With his eyes full of anger.
Help, angels.
I’ll halt after.
There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek: ’twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
As good cause as one would desire.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.
My hour is almost come When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself.
I almost die for food, and let me have it.
I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways.
Good madam, hear me.
Good majesty, Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleased.
Moblèd queen” is good.
Charmian, hark.
Is not this buckled well?
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
Our Italy Shines o’er with civil swords.
Other women cloy The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies, for vilest things Become themselves in her, that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish.
Look, here comes the duke.
Strike the vessels, ho!
How now?
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
By Jupiter, Were I the wearer of Antonio’s beard, I would not shave ’t today.
Give him the cup.
Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated.
The “why” is plain as way to parish church: He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob.
E'en so.
You are naught, you are naught.
I will laugh like a hyena, and that when thou art inclined to sleep.
Nor what I have done by water.
The manner of their deaths?
We will yet do well.
Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall Uplift us to the view.
O, farewell, honest soldier.
Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
The bark is ready and the wind at help, Th' associates tend, and everything is bent For England.
Spake you of Caesar?
But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours, How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her, for Caesar cannot live To be ungentle.
Last thing he did, dear Queen, He kissed—the last of many doubled kisses— This orient pearl.
You are welcome to Elsinore.
O Isis, ’tis impossible.
Get you a place.
Why, what should be the fear?
Well, sit we down, And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
Hush!
Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?
Farewell, kind Charmian.
You shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.
Let him bless thee too.
Where will the old duke live?
Here’s to thy health.
I hope so, Lepidus.
Thou art thy father’s daughter.
His taints and honors Waged equal with him.
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ death Make me revenger.
You have heard him swear downright he was.
He was furnished like a hunter.
Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
Alack, alack!
But there’s no goodness in thy face—if Antony Be free and healthful, so tart a favor To trumpet such good tidings!
Wrinkles forbid!
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
Albeit you have deserved High commendation, true applause, and love, Yet such is now the duke’s condition That he misconsters all that you have done.
Things that are past are done, with me.
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.  
Hadst thou done so, The kings that have revolted, and the soldier That has this morning left thee, would have still Followed thy heels.
Farewell.
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was.
Cleopatra, Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest.
Let it work, For ’tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard.
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears Belong to Egypt.
Half afeard to come.
One speech in it I chiefly loved.
Eros, Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome and see Thy master thus with pleached arms, bending down His corrigible neck, his face subdued To penetrative shame, whilst the wheeled seat Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded His baseness that ensued?
I attend them with all respect and duty.
Why he more than another?
God bless you, sir.
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression Exceeds what we expected.
Nor I.
This I’ll report, dear lady.
I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
I had as lief be wooed of a snail.
Give him no breath, but now Make boot of his distraction.
Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again.
Think of it.
More, I prithee, more.
The oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes.
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
Set down your venerable burden, And let him feed.
And can you by no drift of conference Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
Come away.
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild.
Oh, that’s a brave man.
Time calls upon ’s.
Enjoy thy plainness.
The sight is dismal, And our affairs from England come too late.

Heaven would that she these gifts should have And I to live and die her slave.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
Bid him Report the feature of Octavia: her years, Her inclination.
Awake, sir, awake.
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
Hast thou affections?
Where is he now?
I crave your highness’ pardon.
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.
I like him very well.
Well, sir, good night.
Shall we clap into ’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile.

If the cat will after kind, So, be sure, will Rosalind.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city?
Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry. 
We are arrant knaves, all.
You must not stay here longer.
That which is now a horse, even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water.
It is the right butter-women’s rank to market.
It is well done and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings.
O villain, villain, smiling, damnèd villain!
Has this fellow no feeling of his business?
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?
Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
More, I prithee, more.
Go fetch My best attires.
I will employ thee back again; I find thee Most fit for business.
No, to my cabin.
I was killed i' th' Capitol.
Dost thou lie still?
Take him hence.
Speak this no more.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being.
I shall do ’t. 
I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face.
His soldiership Is twice the other twain.
He is afeard to come.
Prithee, be cheerful.
She had a prophesying fear Of what hath come to pass.
What ho, the Emperor’s guard!
Favors?
What, you look merrily.
You shall not go.
Thou worms' meat in respect of a good piece of flesh, indeed.
Your brother is but young and tender, and, for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in.
Oh, is ’t come to this?
Tis said, man, and farewell.
Caesar?
Had not that been as proper?
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin.
Why then, ’tis good to be a post.
Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
You have me, have you not?
Very many, men and women too.
That ever I should call thee castaway!
She is low-voiced.
How do you, sir?
Yea, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with baser matter.
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Sir, He is with Caesar.
The last she spake Was “Antony, most noble Antony!” Then in the midst a tearing groan did break The name of Antony.
Antony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but I do not greatly care to be deceived, That have no use for trusting.
He hath given his empire Up to a whore; who now are levying The kings o’ th’ earth for war.
To what end, my lord?
I must attend mine office, Or would have done ’t myself.
Well, what worst?
We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
I cannot tell.
I did very well note him.
Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.
God rest you merry, sir.
Your way is shorter.
Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.                       
Tis so.
Ay, madam, it is common.
Farewell.
I’ll be your foil, Laertes.
You should ask me what time o' day.
Go to him, madam, speak to him.
Let’s do so.
Not we.
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.—Come, sister, will you go? 
You were the word of war.
And for my means, I’ll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.
Sir, sir, that cannot be.
Tempt him not so too far.
So-so” is good, very good, very excellent good.
What’s the news?
If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself.
Where’s Seleucus?
Bring him before us.
Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows Not in the power on ’t.

There, my blessing with thee.

Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
Take to you no hard thoughts.
Come hither, sir.
Free, madam, no.
Who ambles time withal?
Tis sport to maul a runner.
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
He hath been a courtier, he swears.
I robbed his wound of it.
The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort!
That I beheld.
Take heed you fall not.
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
And am I then revenged
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world It is not worth leave-taking.
By your most gracious pardon, I sing but after you.
Would the night were come!
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake.
I’ll do ’t.
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.
Learn of the wise and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat.
No, faith, die by attorney.
Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly, The duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changèd son.
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity.
Oh, withered is the garland of the war.
Yes, I have gained my experience.
For the Queen, I’ll take her to my guard.
Motley’s the only wear.
What work is here, Charmian?
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet.
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
Pale or red?
She is banished.
His captain’s heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy’s lust.
O most pernicious woman!
You were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color.
But have I not cause to weep?
Now, Iras, what think’st thou?
You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.
Why do you speak, too, “Why blame you me to love you?”?
Let him that loves me strike me dead.
The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love cause.
Yet, coming from him, that great med’cine hath With his tinct gilded thee.
Look, he recovers.
I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
Why, there then!
Where’s your father?
I’ll tell you in your ear.
Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch, In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encountered: a figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie, Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them.
You shall not find, Though you be therein curious, the least cause For what you seem to fear.
Of it own color too.
So you shall.
She replied It should be better he became her guest, Which she entreated.
A fair name.
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city.
Why, thou sayst well.
Give me your hand, And let me all your fortunes understand.
Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
That’s not so good.
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
How should that be?
I have promised to make all this matter even.
Woo’t tear thyself?
Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer.
Come, sister.—Shepherdess, look on him better, And be not proud.
They are of Norway, sir.
If it be true that good wine needs no bush, ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue.
O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?
Caesar is touched.
Behold and see.
It is not nor it cannot come to good, But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
Most like a gentleman.
The death of Antony Is not a single doom.
Come, sir, will you aboard?
Where lies he?
Canidius, Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land, And our twelve thousand horse.
Methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.
Not I, my lord.
How old are you, friend?
Hark.
I’ll fight at sea.
More villain thou.—Well, push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands.
For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed.
See, my women, Against the blown rose may they stop their nose, That kneeled unto the buds.—Admit him, sir.
Not so, not so.
Hear me, good madam.
It is to be all made of faith and service, And so am I for Phoebe.
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I commend my duty to your lordship.
I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
If fortune be not ours today, it is Because we brave her.
Go to your rest.
Tis fit we understand them.
Didst hear her speak?
Only th’ adulterous Antony, most large In his abominations, turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us.
Sleep a little.
I would not change it.
My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies.
Therefore speak no more.
Ay, my lord.
No medicine in the world can do thee good.
Well, And well am like to do, for I perceive, Four feasts are toward.
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes That can do hurt.
I do not think so.
Stay, Jaques, stay.
Most like.
They are his shards, and he 
It ripens towards it.
is ’t not perfect conscience To quit him with this arm?
Had our general Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
What call you the carriages?
You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in ’t, could you not?
Have with you.
Poor men alone?
Where’s Antony?
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
Why then, good night indeed.
But yet It is our trick.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready, now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
What should I stay— In this wild world?
Ay, my lord.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.
Why should not we Be there in person?
You would seem to know my stops.
Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s “transformation”—so call it Since nor th' exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was.
Say that you love me not, but say not so In bitterness.
For God’s love, let me hear.
I shall, my lord.
Break an hour’s promise in love?
But it is no matter.
This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.
Soft, Caesar.
Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.
William, sir.
And I’ll sleep.
Now he is a-praying.
I have no power upon you.
A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity, but you gods will give us Some faults to make us men.
Good madam, stay a while.
Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world.
Look whe'e he has not turned his color and has tears in ’s eyes.—Prithee, no more.
Soldiers, have careful watch.
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
Oh, this false soul of Egypt!
Thus I let you go And give you to the gods.
They say, one Taurus.
Go with me.
Hear you, sir?
This is a man’s invention, and his hand.
It is a pretty youth—not very pretty— But sure he’s proud—and yet his pride becomes him.
Sir, I lack advancement.
Nay, then.
I doubt some foul play.
Twas a shame no less Than was his loss, to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing.
I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks.
Why?
Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
Fare thee well.
Now from head to foot I am marble-constant.
Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.” I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
Let four captains Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage, For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royally.
Retire!
Never believe it.
What would you have?
Is ’t not strange?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Bring him through the bands.
It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing.
That Herod’s head I’ll have!
At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.
Who would not have his wife so?
Let me be your servant.
I would fain prove so.
Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his honor the mustard was naught.
Who does he accuse?
No, you shall paint when you are old.
Winter garments must be lined, So must slender Rosalind.
By my troth, well met.
The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it.
Of us must Pompey presently be sought, Or else he seeks out us.
No, dear Queen, For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel.
One of them rates All that is won and lost.
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
Fetch that gallant hither.
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!
The business of this man looks out of him.
Rather make My country’s high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains!
Let go!
For what good turn?
Music, moody food Of us that trade in love.
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea, Being prepared for land.
There’s my hand.
He was not merry, Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy, but between both.
Is it not like the king?
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope Says it will come to th’ full.
There’s ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave.
I do desire it with all my heart, and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world.
Where did I leave?
O sir, very well: here in your orchard.
Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel.
Sir, I cannot.
Call forth my household servants.
We’ll so begin these rites As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
Provide your going; Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to.
The morn is fair.
I' faith, i' faith, and both in a tune like two gypsies on a horse.                 
Melt Egypt into Nile, and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents.
This to be true I do engage my life.
Good night to you.
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Say that I wish he never find more cause To change a master.
Music i’ th’ air.
These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself, since I myself Have given myself the cause.
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is Even such a body.
Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her.
Wherefore’s this noise?
Tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
But were I not the better part made mercy, I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge, thou present.
My lord, my lord!
Why do you infect yourself with them?
We’ll hear a play tomorrow.
Well, go to, I will.
What?
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
Indeed, that is out of the air.
Here we.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?
Wilt thou change fathers?
Good now, some excellent fortune!
Good morrow, General.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
O villainy!
Caesar’s.
Yea, very force entangles Itself with strength.
Good lads, how do you both?
Come, down into the boat.
But, hark thee, Charmian.
I have, my lord.
Why, what make you here?
Hail, most dear Caesar!
I am very glad to see you.
At night we’ll feast together.
I' faith, coz, ’tis he.
Well, well, well.
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
She stood and spake.
Nay, let’s follow him.
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
The age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
Caesar is sad, and Lepidus, Since Pompey’s feast, as Menas says, is troubled With the greensickness.
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it.
The point envenomed too!—Then, venom, to thy work.
Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
Keep your word, Phoebe, that you’ll marry me Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.
Me, uncle?
Peace, I say!
Oh, whither hast thou led me, Egypt?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And, now I am remembered, scorned at me.
I have yet Room for six scotches more.
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter; Let’s see how it will give off.
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
Well, again.
Come.
Yonder sure they are coming.
I must be cruel only to be kind.
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous.
For what had he to do to chide at me?
I must be gone.
Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me.
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love, but as you feared him.
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
I will seek Some way to leave him.
Ay, Lepidus.
It curvets unseasonably.
Tender yourself more dearly, Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool.
O my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf. 
I am weary of you. 
What is the matter, my lord?
If this uncouth forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee.
Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock. 
Show ’s the way, sir.
I pray you, pardon me.
The glowworm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Seek it out.
I partly guess, for I have loved ere now.
And wilt thou have me?
I have offended reputation, A most unnoble swerving.
The matter?
Sit down a while And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story, What we have two nights seen.
Ay, go your ways, go your ways.
Why, that were covetousness.
So he does indeed.
But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love.—How now, Ophelia?
I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea.
Welcome, dear madam.
Enobarbus?
This jack of Caesar’s shall Bear us an errand to him.
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
Why is this “impawned,” as you call it?
Conceit upon her father.
My noble girls!
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenomed.
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceived both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger.
Ah, dear, if I be so, From my cold heart let heaven engender hail, And poison it in the source, and the first stone Drop in my neck.
Against my brother Lucius?
Throw some of them at me.
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should down.
Peace!
My most dear lord!
It must be  Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver— Give me leave.
The higher Nilus swells The more it promises.
Whate’er becomes of me, This is a soldier’s kiss.
All is lost!
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damnèd Dane, Drink off this potion.
I’ll make him find him.
Let’s follow, Gertrude.
Royal Queen!
They are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.
It waves me forth again.
My lord, the roinish clown, at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost.
Finish, good lady.
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
Women’s gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention, Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect Than in their countenance.
He is unqualitied with very shame.
Fly And make your peace with Caesar.
Follow him, friends.
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this Relieved but not betrayed.
Not th’ imperious show Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall Be brooched with me.
I humbly thank you.
Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company.
He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him.—Enobarbus!
Well, the beginning that is dead and buried.
Why, I have eat none yet.
Ay.
Believe me, I cannot.
Farewell, my lord.
In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vile life.
I tell you true.
Know you where you are, sir?
I do desire we may be better strangers.
Remember thee!
How if the kiss be denied?
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched, Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Mistress, you must come away to your father.
I must attend the duke at dinner.
Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome.
What did you enact?
The blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage, And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg.
No more.
Yet thou liest in the bleak air.
And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?
But well.
And welcome, welcome!
Nor anyone.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
I found them on a tree.
But such officers do the king best service in the end.
But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. 
Well, good night.
And I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked.
Bruisèd pieces, go.
I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know.
I’ll tarry no longer with you.
Stop it, Marcellus.
My news I might have told hereafter.
But now mine eyes, Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not.
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
I will do ’t, my lord.
Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where I will oppose his fate.
He hath.
Fulvia?
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
I must be laughed at If or for nothing or a little, I Should say myself offended, and with you Chiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at, that I should Once name you derogately, when to sound your name It not concerned me.
Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process.
What poor an instrument May do a noble deed!
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow student.
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
I will tell you why.
Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras.
And so am I for no woman.
Did I, Charmian, Ever love Caesar so?
Here comes the noble Antony.
Tis a brave army, and full of purpose.
Barnardo?
Dead.
I never saw an action of such shame.
Do you hear?
Very well, my lord.
Fie upon “But yet.” “But yet” is as a jailer to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor.
Will you play upon this pipe?
And I do think—or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do—that I have found The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.
They have dispatched with Pompey; he is gone.
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business as the bitter day Would quake to look on.
How “seventh cause”?—Good my lord, like this fellow.
Orlando, my liege, the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
Lo, where it comes again.
He stays upon your will.
I shall obey you.
Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops, And all the haunt be ours.—Come, Eros, Eros!
O Antony, Antony, Antony!
Look you who comes here, a young man and an old in solemn talk. 
Patience, gentle Audrey.
By the mass, I was about to say something.
I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs.
Yes, just.
Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?
One.
Calls your Worship?
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
Is she shrill-tongued or low?
Thy luster thickens When he shines by.
Friends to this ground.
Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
You shall have some part of your will.
No, no.
Let be.
Have at you now!
If he, compact of jars, grow musical, We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
He did ask favor.
Well said.
What, frighted with false fire?
Seal then, and all is done.— Eros!—I come, my Queen.—Eros!—Stay for me.
And so he goes to heaven.
Is ’t not your trick?
Triple-turned whore!
You’ve said, sir.
Armed, my lord.
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence. 
What’s Antony?
And yonder, Caesar.
Pray you now, Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command.
Nature presently distilled Helen’s cheek, but not her heart, Cleopatra’s majesty, Atalanta’s better part, Sad Lucretia’s modesty.
More, more, I prithee, more.
Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee.
Good sirs, take heart.
So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends.
Good my lord, tell it.
I pray you all, If you have hitherto concealed this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still.
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
When valor preys on reason, It eats the sword it fights with.
Ah, women, women!
O my lord, my lord, Forgive my fearful sails!
Give me particulars.
Mad for thy love?
We’ll bury him, and then, what’s brave, what’s noble, Let’s do ’t after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us.
Welcome.
Fulvia is dead.
Come, let’s away. 
Faith, we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.
For charitable prayers Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her.
All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you.
Show me, my women, like a queen.
That’s good.
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
Your fortunes are alike.
Fare you well, my lord.
I will watch tonight.
These time ambles withal.
Come on.
Shall I strike now?
Thou hast seen these signs.
And I do think she’s thirty.
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
Will you know them then?
Remember me.” I have sworn ’t.
Thy mother’s poisoned.
I shall fall.
Why, right, you are in the right.
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscurèd in the circle of this forest.
And mine, to eke out hers.
Stayed it long?
I’ll take my leave.
A gallant curtal-axe upon my thigh, A boar-spear in my hand, and in my heart Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will, We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside— As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies?
Here’s the manner of ’t: I’ th’ marketplace, on a tribunal silvered, Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned.
The fellow has good judgment.
In time we hate that which we often fear.
Fear nothing.
Fall to.
Be wary, then.
These words are not mine.
But, mistress, know yourself.
Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at ’s feet, and there to kneel.
To whom do you speak this?
My precious Queen, forbear, And give true evidence to his love which stands An honorable trial.
Come, good fellow, put thine iron on.
Oh, thy vile lady!
Pardon me, I pray you.
Madam?
Alas, poor ghost!
Then thou art damned.
From top to toe?
Why do you send so thick?
How did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?
I pray you now receive them.
My voice is ragged.
What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt.
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.
Lord of lords!
Who hath relieved you?
Thou hast my love.
Desist, and drink.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee.
Behold, sir.
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
Are they so followed?
Till I shall see you in your soldiers’ dress, Which will become you both, farewell.
Let’s ha ’t, good soldier.
Adieu.
Put color in thy cheek.
They say you are a melancholy fellow.
Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed, And it portends alone the fall of Antony.
My noble brother!
No going then!
My liege and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
Bid them all fly.
So.— Thus then, thou most renowned: Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand’st, Further than he is Caesar.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile, That little cares for buying anything.
But give me your hand, Menas.
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
The next Caesarion smite, Till by degrees the memory of my womb, Together with my brave Egyptians all, By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey!
Is ’t long or round?
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?
Will it eat me?
Change you color?
Caesar’s will?
Nor I, my lord.
If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
How, the nonpareil!
Woo’t thou fight well?
Do so.
Very well.
My father was no traitor.
By mine honor I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster.
No further, sir.
My arm is sore.
Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard.
What should I do I do not?
But, first or last, Your fine Egyptian cookery shall have The fame.
On Fortune’s cap we are not the very button.
She In th’ habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appeared, and oft before gave audience, As ’tis reported, so.
Who maintains 'em?
Caesar, I go.
Say, “the brave Antony.”                                                 The valiant Caesar!
He that plays the king shall be welcome.
Belike ’tis but a rumor.
Well, well, away.
Oh, that brave Caesar!
But it shall not be so long; this wrestler shall clear all.
Yet here, Laertes?
I dare damnation.
Let th’ Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a-ducking.
I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.
Taurus!
Go with me, Silvius.
Since the torch is out, Lie down and stray no farther.
Farewell.
As I do live, my honored lord, ’tis true.
I pray you, pass with your best violence.
And what wilt thou do—beg when that is spent?
O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
Bloody, bawdy villain!
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar.
Vex not his prescience.
Sir, the Queen.
You have served me well, And kings have been your fellows.
God be at your table.
This is mere madness.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.
I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion.
Hear me, Queen: The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile, but my full heart Remains in use with you.
I would have you.
I shall win at the odds.
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning.
The world esteemed thy father honorable, But I did find him still mine enemy.
My lord, we were sent for.
What was he, sad or merry?
Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more ’twill be eleven.
Where died she?
And how was that ta'en up?
Your hands, come then.
What mar you then, sir?
Why are you virtuous?
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.
Hold off your hands.
All strange and terrible events are welcome, But comforts we despise.
That’s twice.
What thou wouldst do Is done unto thy hand.
When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee?
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh What it is worth embraced.
Let her not walk i' th' sun.
What would you?
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves For a fair victory.
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.—Farewell, good Master Oliver, not               'Tis no matter.
This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest.
The poop was beaten gold, Purple the sails, and so perfumèd that The winds were lovesick with them.
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
He brings me liberty.
Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is ’t to leave betimes?
The interim’s mine.
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Set it by a while.
He shall in time be ready.
Is ’t not denounced against us?
Do you know me, my lord?
If you like upon report The soil, the profit, and this kind of life, I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
Alas, he is too young.
Out, fool.
This if she perform, She shall not sue unheard.
Tis the last service that I shall command you.
They stay upon your patience.
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier?
What news?
Come apace, good Audrey.
Now, my dearest Queen— Pray you, stand farther from me.
Tis brief, my lord.
Yet if you there Did practice on my state, your being in Egypt Might be my question.
Nay, but, Ophelia— Pray you, mark.
The news is true, my lord.
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
A better instance, I say.
If she find him not, To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.
Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin.
O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes And still conclusion, shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me.
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings, Shall enter me with him.
Let me sit down.
There comes an old man and his three sons— I could match this beginning with an old tale.
As thou art to thyself.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
That do I long to hear.
I say she never did invent this letter.
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue.
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity.
Give him heedful note.
If you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.
My mother.
I’ll leave thee Now like a man of steel.
Sing it.
Where yond pine does stand I shall discover all.
I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent.
The Emperor calls Canidius.
No more.
He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
This was not counterfeit.
Nay, but who is it?
Then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
Go softly on.
No, by this hand.
He is too disputable for my company.
I warrant it will.
But what will you be called?
Make assay.
Do the boys carry it away?
Courage.
But if you do refuse to marry me, You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp?
You shall hear me.
Hence, horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me!
Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I’ll have a suit of sables.
My lord?
Whereat grieved— That so his sickness, age, and impotence Was falsely borne in hand—sends out arrests On Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys, Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
God 'ild you for your last company.
What!
All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are.
I hope so.
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested.
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place.
Who’s his lieutenant, hear you?
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
My excellent good friends!
Come, come, you are a fool, And turned into the extremity of love.
Come, more, another stanzo.
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
Oh, my fortunes have Corrupted honest men!
Do this expediently, and turn him going.
Nothing, madam.
Oh, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
Who shall stay you?
Trouble yourselves no further.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is, in the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage.
What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven?
Would you not have me honest?
God be wi' you.
Then there’s hope a great man’s memory may outlive his life half a year.
Fare thee well awhile.
Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please, for so fools have.
Tis thus: Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death, I hear him as he flattered.
Tis paltry to be Caesar.
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath sealed thee for herself, for thou hast been— As one in suffering all that suffers nothing— A man that Fortune’s buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks.
Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword.
I’ll humbly signify what in his name, That magical word of war, we have effected: How with his banners and his well-paid ranks The ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o’ th’ field.
If thou dost play with him at any game, Thou art sure to lose, and of that natural luck He beats thee ’gainst the odds.
No, nor mine now.
Speak’st thou in sober meanings?
Most certain.
Alas!
Be gentle to her.
Where remains he?
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life.
Welcome hither.
What news, my lord?
I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way forever.
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done.
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
Take me up.
He brings you figs.
Brother, good night.
Truly, I have him, but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal.
Hoo!
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damnèd incest.
Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious.
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.
And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered.
Madam, in Rome.
Sit, sir.
To punish me for what you make me do Seems much unequal.
We will.
As woman’s love.
Pluck them asunder.
Were we before our armies, and to fight, I should do thus.
Good Enobarbus, ’tis a worthy deed, And shall become you well, to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech.
Do it.
And mine, but it grows something stale with me.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue.
With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how time moves. 
Forbear, and eat no more.
Conception is a blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive—Friend, look to ’t.
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony.
Therefore use thy discretion.
I am alone the villain of the earth, And feel I am so most.
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
You are rather point-device in your accouterments, as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
Give me your hand.
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die, meantime Laugh at his challenge.
Stay and speak!
As I am Egypt’s queen, Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine Is Caesar’s homager.
What is the success?
And you, fair sister.
But this it is: our foot Upon the hills adjoining to the city Shall stay with us.
I have a ship Laden with gold.
I am called Dercetus.
Lord Hamlet— Heaven secure him!
Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
I will be faithful.
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
Buzz, buzz.
If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented.
Who, I?
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
May I never To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, Dream of impediment!
I’ll strike and cry, “Take all.”                                                           Well said.
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?
There’s nothing in her yet.
She was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
Sport?
This morning, like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note, begins betimes.
Let him come in.
So, again, good night.
I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there.
Will he tell us what this show meant?
There’s enough.
Hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number—hoo!— His love to Antony.
I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing.
I’ll call thee “Hamlet,” “King,” “Father,” “royal Dane.” O, answer me!
God’s bodykins, man, much better.
Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
Excellent.
Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
Not a whit.
Remember’st thou any that have died on ’t?
I thought that all things had been savage here, And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment.
No slander.
Thou hast not, cousin.
I hear him mock The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath.—Husband, I come!
You shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you.
Hold you the watch tonight?
Did you not speak to it?
You stayed well by ’t in Egypt.
Oh, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily.
Indeed?
Here comes Antony.
Lead me from hence.
Therefore prepare you.
Iras, long farewell.
Wake her not.
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man’s apparel?
The hand of death hath raught him.
This is the very false gallop of verses.
This is old.
Sweet Phoebe, pity me.
How are they escoted?
Most heavy day!
My lord!
Now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign. 
Lepidus is high-colored.
Impart.
Thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear-surprisèd eyes Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him.
Am I a coward?
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there, That kills and pains not?
Tis strange.
Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd? 
A worthy fool!
Look, they weep, And I, an ass, am onion-eyed.
Hark!
I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he for gold will give us any food.
Crack thy frail case!—Apace, Eros, apace.
Swoons rather, for so bad a prayer as his Was never yet for sleep.
Now, my lord.
How long hath she been thus?
Come, one for me.
Not if the small come first.
Would I might never O’ertake pursued success, but I do feel, By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites My very heart at root.
More, Domitius: My lord desires you presently.
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate.
Give ’s your hand.
I have done ill, Of which I do accuse myself so sorely That I will joy no more.
But, sirrah, mark, we use To say the dead are well.
It is here, Hamlet.
And fixed his eyes upon you?
Do not say so, my lord.
It is my arm.
Farewell.
Peace!
No, fair princess.
That’s the end.
There’s no offense, my lord.
I do not like her name.
Most gracious majesty!
Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more In Alexandria.
Then the whining schoolboy with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.
I will not till I please.
If thou and nature can so gently part, The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch, Which hurts, and is desired.
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.
Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly.
Best safety lies in fear.
And I for Ganymede.
They are not near my conscience.
Let me have audience for a word or two.
Therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly. 
Pray, then, foresee me one.
I’ll never see ’t!
Ay.
Good my lord, bid him welcome.
Tell us where ’tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.
Ay, amen!
But beshrew my jealousy!
Some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this.
Betrayed I am.
My necessaries are embarked.
This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile.
Art thou thus boldened, man, by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners, That in civility thou seem’st so empty?
All the world’s a stage, And all the men and women merely players.
He comes to kill my heart.
Locked in her monument.
He’s married to Octavia.
Thou art a fool.
This is no place, this house is but a butchery.
As for my wife, I would you had her spirit in such another.
Not a mouse stirring.
Am not I your Rosalind? 
And their tongues rot That speak against us!
Hark further.
I know by that same eye there’s some good news.
The duke is humorous.
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
Will you lead, lords?
O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meet, but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter.
Rapier and dagger.
See, Caesar!
Let us score their backs And snatch ’em up, as we take hares, behind!
Your features, Lord warrant us!
This ’greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted.
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling. 
Till then sit still, my soul.
My lord, the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
Here’s yet some liquor left.  
Lo thee!
No.
Great Mark Antony Is now a widower.
I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part.
The Queen approaches.
As of a man faithful and honorable.
Here comes the man you mean.
Not see him since?
But by sea he is an absolute master.
Nay, hear him.
I marvel why I answered not again.
I saw him once.
Instance, briefly.
Thou bring’st me out of tune.
O noble fool!
But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages—that’s the French bet against the Danish.
Sir, fare you well.
Within our files there are, Of those that served Mark Antony but late, Enough to fetch him in.
They are coming to the play.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
But if thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labor.
And do still, by these pickers and stealers.
Where is the fellow?
I do, truly, for thou swear’st to me thou art honest.
Didst thou hear these verses?
Well, sir, get you in.
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
By no means, sir.
Madam, O good Empress!
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
The man is innocent.
Set we our squadrons on yond side o’ th’ hill, In eye of Caesar’s battle, from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly.
You must to Parthia.
Where’s Dolabella, To second Proculeius?
No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love.
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensèd points Of mighty opposites.
By Jove that thunders!
No greater heart in thee?
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.
Nay, hear them, Antony.
Madam, I will.
Menas, I’ll not on shore.
My lord, from head to foot.
Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
Thou livest.
I do not set my life in a pin’s fee, And for my soul—what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?
I shall take it, sir.
Give me a kiss.
In thee there is not half an hour of life.
Our size of sorrow, Proportioned to our cause, must be as great As that which makes it.
I am but hurt.
Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
So much for this, sir.
Good madam.
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?
And in part him, but,” you may say, “not well.
Go.
Use them after your own honor and dignity.
Best you safed the bringer Out of the host.
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
Upon your sword Sit laurel victory, and smooth success Be strewed before your feet.
Yes, gracious madam.
I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill- favoredly. 
Speak.
We defy augury.
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death.
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?— Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do you say, sister?
He’ll make a proper man.
She’s dead too, our sovereign.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights.
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
O, reform it altogether!
Still be ’t yours.
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Thank you.
Be pleased to tell us— For this is from the present—how you take The offers we have sent you.
I have a daughter—have while she is mine— Who in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this.
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: “Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star.
That will I, should I die the hour after.
Do you think I meant country matters?
When you sued staying, Then was the time for words.
Affection!
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot Of all thy sex.
Madam, I wish it may.
Down on your knees And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love, For I must tell you friendly in your ear, Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick.
You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia.
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—
That’s two of his weapons.
This is his sword.
Most monsterlike be shown For poor’st diminutives, for dolts, and let Patient Octavia plow thy visage up With her preparèd nails!
You are welcome.
Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
The cease of majesty Dies not alone, but, like a gulf, doth draw What’s near it with it.
Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful.
I pray you leave me. 
Not very well, but I have met him oft, And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of.
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land!
Bid the players make haste.
I understand not, madam.
Ah, Rosencrantz!
Will you hear the letter?
He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee?
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Thou hast a sister by the mother’s side, Admired Octavia.
Bring me to Antony.
Oh, rare for Antony!
Stands he or sits he?
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
I charge thee, speak!
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
No messenger but thine, and all alone Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people.
Let me report to him Your sweet dependency, and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to.
How is ’t, Laertes?
Be ’t so.
What’s thy passion?
And when shalt thou see him again?
Now, Charmian!
By sea, what else?
Love is merely a madness and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do, and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love, too.
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.
Noblest of men, woo’t die?
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly, And all the gods go with you!
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels I am possessed of.
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send Measures of wheat to Rome.
A heavy sight!
O infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from The world’s great snare uncaught?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
How chances it they travel?
Tis not a time for private stomaching.
Answer me in one word.
Enobarbus, welcome.
Oh, behold How pomp is followed!
I fear me you’ll be in till then.
Ay, my lord.
If it please His Majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me.
Most kind messenger, Say to great Caesar this in deputation: I kiss his conqu’ring hand.
For when she saw— Which never shall be found—you did suspect She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead.
To lend me arms and aid when I required them, The which you both denied.
I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute.
My father charged you in his will to give me good education.
I had a wound here that was like a “T,” But now ’tis made an “H.”                                                        They do retire.
Prithee, peace.
Twas I, but ’tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was, since my conversion So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
Then love me, Rosalind.
Where is he gone?
You have been nobly borne. 
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Pray you, tell him I am his fortune’s vassal, and I send him The greatness he has got.
Come, Dolabella, see High order in this great solemnity.
From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine.
Experience, manhood, honor, ne’er before Did violate so itself.
This mortal house I’ll ruin, Do Caesar what he can.
To do thus I learned of thee.
There, my lord.
Make your best use of this.
I can no more.
He sings at grave- making. 
Get thee to a nunnery.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfilled, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Most constantly.
But look to it: Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is.
You bring me out.
I feared he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee.
Madam, I trust, not so.
Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling.
I’ll cross it though it blast me.—Stay, illusion!
So is the bargain.
I am thy father’s spirit, Doomed for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away.
Nay, I care not for their names.
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered.
Farewell.
How parted he with thee?
Prithee, who is ’t that thou mean’st?
Remember it, my lord?
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
Our master and mistress seeks you.
Oh, what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it!
And I am your Rosalind.
We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears.
O my dear lord—   Nay, do not think I flatter.
My resolution and my hands I’ll trust, None about Caesar.
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.
But if thy love were ever like to mine— As sure I think did never man love so— How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
My lord, I have news to tell you.
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught.
Friends, begone.
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
Have I, my lord?
He is a god and knows What is most right.
Why ask you this?
He is the general challenger.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
The gods forbid!
How now, masters?
With bills on their necks: “Be it known unto all men by these presents.”  The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him.
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud, The universal landlord.
This grief is crowned with consolation.
Do it at once, Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed.
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Is he of God’s making?
Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound, And after some small space, being strong at heart,
It shall be to your good, for my father’s house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland’s will I estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
Farewell, dear mother.
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity a while, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story.
Oh, excellent!
I will give thee mine.
I would not be cured, youth.
Good duke, receive thy daughter.
Ah, soldier!
Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
Faith, sir, so-so.
I am not so well as I should be, but I’ll ne’er out.
Help me, my women!
No?
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.
Yet in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me.
How say you now?
We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Now, the next day Was our sea fight, and what to this was sequent Thou know’st already.
What do you call the play?
If they suffer our departure, death’s the word.
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
I would kiss before I spoke.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.
I have fair meanings, sir.
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so. 
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
He will not fight with me, Domitius?
We must be patient, but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' th' cold ground.
From Silvius, sir.
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
Sir, this is the matter—  I beseech you, remember— Nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith.
Thy business?
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly.—Heaven and earth, Must I remember?
Not know me yet?
Nor shalt not till necessity be served.
Marry, this is miching 
What sayest thou?
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
He cannot like her long.
So, adieu.
Ah ha!
So was I when your Highness took his dukedom.
As wit and fortune will.
Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole.
What, no more ceremony?
But all the charms of love, Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!
Invest me in my motley.
It is my birthday.
This for him.
I do so, I confess it.
If you can, your reason?
Well said, old mole!
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
Give you good night.
I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these, but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness. 
These are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither.
Not I.
We’ll speak to them, and tonight I’ll force The wine peep through their scars.—Come on, my Queen, There’s sap in ’t yet.
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things.
And then he drew a dial from his poke And, looking on it with lackluster eye, Says very wisely, “It is ten o'clock.
I will not speak with her.
It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
What, for a counter, would I do but good?
Support him by the arm.
And if tomorrow Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope Our landmen will stand up.
Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players (as it is most like if their means are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?
Oh, Caesar, This Charmian lived but now.
What do you think of me?
Speak not against it.
If you outstay the time, upon mine honor And in the greatness of my word, you die.
A touch, a touch, I do confess ’t.
Most noble sir, arise.
Let me shake thy hand.
Welcome to Rome.
I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders.
Pray thee, marry us.
I am sorry.
Do not, my lord.
I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder. 
O, yet defend me, friends.
And your experience makes you sad.
Oh, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Have you any further trade with us?
And smelt so?
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
The noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal.
O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers.
And shall, sir.
Niggard of question, but of our demands Most free in his reply.
Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.
And I for Ganymede.
Welcome, lady.
She swoons to see them bleed.
What speech, my good lord?
Come, “The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge—”               
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve, I’ll visit you.
It waves me still.
My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longèd long to redeliver.
Why, how now, monsieur?
I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
Is he married?
Go we to him.
I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.
If Caesar please, our master Will leap to be his friend.
For I am sure, Though you can guess what temperance should be, You know not what it is.
I your servant.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
We will ourselves provide.
The time of universal peace is near.
No, I protest, I know not the contents.
I am bound to hear.
Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn And give it food.
But do not so.
Think yourself a baby That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling.
Will Caesar speak?
Or I, I promise thee.
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice.
Dear master, I can go no further.
They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.
Sister, welcome.
Since Cleopatra died I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness.
Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks The pauses that he makes.
Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours, And make the wars alike against my stomach, Having alike your cause?
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
Adieu, good Queen.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Come, Charmian.
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death.
Now all labor Mars what it does.
Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
My lord, in Athens.
Come, Menas.
To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite.
You touched my vein at first.
He’ll never yield to that.
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married under a bush like a beggar?
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world?
What should a man do but be merry?
That he hath not.
Hereafter, in a better world than this, I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
O Cleopatra!
Good your highness, patience.
I do beseech your Grace, Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
My lord?
Make thee a fortune from me.
He is married?
Just as high as my heart.
I shall entreat him To answer like himself.
I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
What else?
Very good.
But let us rear The higher our opinion, that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck The ne’er lust-wearied Antony.
Long live the king!
We have engaged ourselves too far.
Happily he’s the second time come to them, for they say an old man is twice a child.
The foul’st best fits My latter part of life.
And so, adieu.
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
Come, some music!
Being done unknown, I should have found it afterwards well done, But must condemn it now.
If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him, That majesty, to keep decorum, must No less beg than a kingdom.
In pity of the challenger’s youth, I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
Art thou wise?
Strike not by land; keep whole.
I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel.
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear.—Prithee, tell her but a workaday fortune.
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria.
I know no touch of it, my lord.
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress’s praise, Thou hast not loved.
I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are.
You must translate.
Good my lord.
Not in my husband’s nose.
Ay, my lord.
Adieu, adieu, adieu.
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof Were well deserved of rashness.
Your reason.
Good night—but go not to mine uncle’s bed.
Where is he now?
Give me mine angle.
I must attend on Caesar.
Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on, and yet, within a month— Let me not think on ’t.
Our son shall win.
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow.—Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.
I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.
What, my lord?
Who’s there?
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness, Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, Now hazarded to thy grace.
I’ll bring you to him straight.
Thus do all traitors.
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
We shall know by this fellow.
The April’s in her eyes; it is love’s spring, And these the showers to bring it on.
What is between you?
Is he dead?
I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them.
So please you, for I never heard it yet, Yet heard too much of Phoebe’s cruelty.
The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
Do not, Phoebe.
Nay, and most like.
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear ’t that th' opposèd may beware of thee.
Call in the messengers.
Know you him?
Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
What noise?
O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful, and yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping! 
But when we in our viciousness grow hard— Oh, misery on ’t!—the wise gods seel our eyes, In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us Adore our errors, laugh at ’s while we strut To our confusion.
Were you made the messenger?
There’s no clock in the forest.
Ay, or any show that you will show him.
No, indeed are they not.
Dost thou hear, lady?
Adieu.
Caesar, I shall.
Rather on Nilus’ mud Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring.
I cannot go no further.
You are very well met.
Let’s tonight Be bounteous at our meal.
But yet hie you to Egypt again.
Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome.
I would I had thy inches.
But here my father comes.
Why,       Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?
Give me my robe.
Go with me and see What I can show in this.
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness; sluttishness may come hereafter.
I will not hurt him.
When I think, I must speak.
And I for no woman.
There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned.
I’ll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention. 
Thou strik’st not me, ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st.
But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides?
Let’s away And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight.
Shall we go, coz?
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.
Oh!
What’s your pleasure, sir?
O excellent young man!
Hast thou drunk well?
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
At sea, I think.
Safely stowed.
Ay, sir, I thank God.
For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you.
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.
But why, why, why?
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed, and in the morning early They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
But heavenly Rosalind!
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon.
But for the seventh cause.
My father’s love is enough to honor him.
By th' mass, and ’tis like a camel indeed.
Oh, I have heard him speak of that same brother, And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men.
Never make known what you have seen tonight.
Come.
When it concerns the fool or coward.
I thank you most for him.
Fulvia is dead.
Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of bell and burial.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Hush!
Or I have no observance.
Gallus, go you along.
Your commission’s ready.
I’ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted.
Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
Why, she defies me Like Turk to Christian.
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
They are incensed.
Show me which way.
My will, not all the world.
Into my grave.
Nay, that’s certain.
Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.
Throw my heart Against the flint and hardness of my fault, Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder And finish all foul thoughts.
Upon my sword.
The god of Jupiter.
Come, let’s all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense In soft and delicate Lethe.
I will go seek the king.
What’s the noise?
In the same figure like the king that’s dead.
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion— Have you a daughter?
Thou wilt write to Antony?
So frowned he once when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
The gods best know—                                              Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed!
Of a snail?
Treason!
If every of your wishes had a womb, And fertile every wish, a million.
Barnardo has my place.
Their preparation is today by sea.
Oh, make an end Of what I have begun!
Oh, how he loves Caesar!
Oh, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise.
Art thou learned?
Who?
Now, Eros.
I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows.
Bring it to that, The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill-uttering throat.
Yet they are not joined.
We please them not by land.
Let us now stay and see it.
And I for Rosalind.
Rest you happy!
He was a man.
But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do.
Feed and sleep.
She dies for ’t.—Eros, ho!
Is it honest in deed and word?
Doth he not deserve well?
Get thee hence.
There were none principal.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
How!
How now, friend Eros!
Even a toy in hand here, sir.
Brown, madam, and her forehead As low as she would wish it.
For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other.
Nay, I’ll help too.
Oh, I followed that I blush to look upon!
First, madam, he is well.
Good madam, patience.
I’ll rest.
And though I make this marriage for my peace, I’ th’ East my pleasure lies.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
Forbear me.
Come.
It cannot be.
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me.
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun.
Is it a custom?
No offense i' th' world.
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
And is ’t not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?
And the tears of it are wet.
I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day, Or look on thine.
I have done my work ill, friends.
We’ll lead you thither.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
For both, my lord.
Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at.
Farewell, good Signior Love.
Here they’ll be, man.
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To th' ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams.
We shall be the more marketable.—Bonjour, Monsieur Le Beau.
Well I know the man.
I am the duke That loved your father.
If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood.
Detain no jot, I charge thee.
Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe Caesar’s no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold.
My lord, I cannot.
Here’s metal more attractive.
Run one before And let the Queen know of our gests.
How looked he?
Some of my shame, if you will know of me What man I am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stained.
Most welcome home!
She has robbed me of my sword.
Courteous lord, one word.
What think you on ’t?
I loved you not.
What’s that, my lord?
And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal!
We looked not for Mark Antony here.
Caesar, and that, having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoiled, we had not rated him His part o’ th’ isle.
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch.
But in my terms of honor I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement Till by some elder masters, of known honor, I have a voice and precedent of peace To keep my name ungored.
Send to his brother.
It is just so high as it is, and moves with its own organs.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor.
Nothing.
Oh, horrible, oh, horrible, most horrible!
Then I will come to my mother by and by.
Art thou there, Diomed?
Orlando.
Gods and goddesses, All the whole synod of them!
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once.
The people love me, and the sea is mine.
That you must teach me.
Thus it must be.
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untunable.
Poor Antony!
Fie upon ’t, foh!
I never hated thee.
Look where it comes again!
They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
I will.
Though all the world could see, None could be so abused in sight as he.
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
That will I, Pompey.
Twere good you let him know, For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide?
I am but mad north-north-west.
I have said.
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defense?
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
You have seen cruel proof of this man’s strength.
Tis for the dead, not for the quick.
While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguiled all spies.
Go to, then.
I saw them not.
He’s not thy kinsman.
He is justly served.
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar’s or mine?
I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me.
It signs well, does it not?
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty, For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility.
We think not so, my lord.
No, I will not.
My lord, that would dishonor him!
He’s friends with Caesar, In state of health, thou say’st, and, thou say’st, free.
He, sir, that must marry this woman.
Hers you are.
Of this my letters Before did satisfy you.
So fare you well.
No, it is struck.
Now I am alone.
So the gods preserve thee!
O bosom black as death!
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
I will speak daggers to her but use none.
Marry, that should you if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
Most absolute lord, My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
My lord, I have.
Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress’s brother.
God be with my old master.
Well met, honest gentleman.
These three world-sharers, these competitors, Are in thy vessel.
And so had I, but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too for your society.
Antony only, that would make his will Lord of his reason.
I loved you ever.
Dost thou hold there still?
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee.
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.
Ho, ho, ho!
If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
The messengers!
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired After the shepherd that complained of love, Who you saw sitting by me on the turf, Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress.
Why will My lord do so?
There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance.
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony.
But small to greater matters must give way.
O limèd soul that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged!
Go charge Agrippa Plant those that have revolted in the vant, That Antony may seem to spend his fury Upon himself.
Come, for the third, Laertes.
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy Best to be served.
Do, if it will not stand.
And nothing is at a like goodness still.
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
I am dying, Egypt, dying.
Give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, If they will patiently receive my medicine.
And what art thou that dar’st Appear thus to us?
There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limped in pure love.
Is thy name William?
How otherwise?— Will you be ruled by me?
And let him ply his music.
Nay, but the devil take mocking.
We’ll to th’ river.
Last night of all, When yond same star that’s westward from the pole Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one— Peace, break thee off.
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view.
Is it possible?
A piece of him.
There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life.
I will tell you.
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son, His youngest son, and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick.
He has deserved it, were it carbuncled Like holy Phoebus’ car.
No, Antony, take the lot.
Rosalind of a better leer than you.
Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony.
But I will tell you at some meeter season.
To none but thee, no more but when to thee.
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Who comes here?
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
Such as I am, I come from Antony.
How fares my lord?
Woo’t fast?
They follow the king’s pleasure.
My name is Thidias.
Get thee to bed, Francisco.
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited.
Ay, marry, is ’t.
Let me question more in particular.
I will not long be troubled with you.
Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.
You lie out on ’t, sir, and therefore it is not yours.
Indeed?
I have Immortal longings in me.
What sayst thou?
I’ll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it.
Do it, England, For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me.
Give me some wine and let me speak a little.
Look to ’t, I charge you.
Madam!
I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly Look him i’ th’ face.
E’en as the o’erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
Soundly, my lord.
Caesar, I shall.
Such a one is a natural philosopher.
What woman, then?
Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too—at each ear a hearer.
Let the world see His nobleness well acted, which your death Will never let come forth.
This speed of Caesar’s Carries beyond belief.
A messenger from Caesar.
My lord, he is but even now gone hence.
For a taste: If a hart do lack a hind, Let him seek out Rosalind.
Look, here I have you.
Most meet That first we come to words, and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent, Which, if thou hast considered, let us know If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here.
What art thou, fellow?
Nor I.
I am he that is so love-shaked.
God help thee, shallow man.
And from hence I go To make these doubts all even.
But i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.
Pah!
Dead.
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
Madam, madam— Antonio’s dead!
Swallows have built In Cleopatra’s sails their nests.
Had I great Juno’s power, The strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove’s side.
Speak, I’ll go no further.
But come thy ways.
Not that I know.
Have you done yet?
And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
Ah, thou spell!
By the fire That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war As thou affects.
No more be done.
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal—except my life, except my life, except my life.
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind.
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company?
What ho, Horatio!
I do not think ’t.
Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.
Fare thee well at once.
Octavia weeps To part from Rome.
Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.
Let me comply with you in this garb—lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment than yours.
If our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.
And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness?
You do but dally.
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
No, faith, not a jot.
So was I when your Highness banished him.
Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
But how hath she received his love?
You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman.
I have not art to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, oh, most best, believe it.
They know By th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth Or foison follow.
We have store to do ’t, And they have earned the waste.
No more a soldier.
Folded the writ up in form of th' other, Subscribed it, gave ’t th' impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known.
I could do more to do Antonius good, But ’twould offend him, and in his offense Should my performance perish.
I had thought t’ have held it poor; but since my lord Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
Is this well done?
These are counselors That feelingly persuade me what I am.” Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance.
Many hot inroads They make in Italy—the borders maritime Lack blood to think on ’t—and flush youth revolt.
Our duty to your honor.
Come.
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has, Or needs not us.
Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promisèd?
My lord, I did, But answer made it none.
Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person.
Yours, yours.
But, my good lord— Wherefore should you do this?
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me, but You patched up your excuses.
And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character.
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, That long time have been barren.
Humbly, sir, I thank you.
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men.
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
Give me up the truth.
I would it might be hangers till then.
Art rich?
Fare you well.
With all my heart, good youth.
I’ll follow it.
I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home.
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me.
O, I die, Horatio.
Forever and a day.
Now, sir, what make you here?
Hold off the earth awhile Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
But as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
Truly, she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm.
That’s my brave lord!
Longer, longer.
Think on me, That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time.
Sir, the gods Will have it thus.
Give me some light, away!
Tis strange.
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither.—Holla, Dennis!
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly.
By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me.
I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touched with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal.
Ah, let be, let be!
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more.
I would not see ’t.
Now go we in content To liberty, and not to banishment.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
And time is at his period.
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
What you would have I’ll stay to know at your abandoned cave.
Your heart’s desires be with you.
Egypt, thou knew’st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings, And thou shouldst tow me after.
Be comforted, dear madam.
You cannot feed capons so.
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts, and never Fly off our loves again!
The third part, then, is drunk.
Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.
Hamlet.” This in obedience hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means, and place, All given to mine ear.
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me, Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
Come, sir.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
Cleopatra— Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of?
What say you?
Can Fulvia die?
What dost you mean by this?
Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted pace.
His reared arm Crested the world.
You have said, but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.
The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens.
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious Importeth thee to know, this bears.
My good friends, I’ll leave you till night.
I made no such report.
What features?
Or I will live Or bathe my dying honor in the blood Shall make it live again.
Even he, madam.
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.
Thus we are agreed.
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped.
Aboard, aboard, for shame!
I little thought You would have followed.
Good night.
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear All your true followers out.
What makes him here?
Good my lord, How does your honor for this many a day?
The queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.
For Antony, I have no ears to his request.
A more unhappy lady, If this division chance, ne’er stood between, Praying for both parts.
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal.
Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds?
Why should the poor be flattered?
But ’tis not so above.
Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend.
What is a man If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed?
But it is no matter.
I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has.
Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey.
My dear’st sister!
I am poisoned.
Are you native of this place?
But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
My brother never Did urge me in his act.
Cried he?
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Know’st thou not the duke Hath banished me, his daughter?
Take them in. 
Would she had never given you leave to come!
I am glad to see you well.— Horatio?
Why, this that I speak of.
What fool is this?
What is his strength by land?
Here’s to Caesar.
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
You tremble and look pale.
He cannot speak, my lord.
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawned, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns—as girdle, hangers, and so.
It nothing ill becomes thee.— Aboard my galley I invite you all.
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
Your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to ’t.
Madam, how like you this play?
If he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back again.
Peace, fool.
It is shaped, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it hath breadth.
What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food, Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road?
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
O sir, you are too sure an augurer.
But till that time Come not thou near me.
Th’ art an honest man.
Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love.
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin, For thou thyself hast been a libertine, As sensual as the brutish sting itself, And all th' embossèd sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to ’t with delight.
I prithee, tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace.
Happy is your Grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
We have, sir.
How came he mad?
This is the man.
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips.
Drink thou.
Is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her?
What manner o’ thing is your crocodile?
Who’s there?
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart!
O, cleave, my sides!
The meantime, lady, I’ll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother.
Tis no matter.— Go to the fellow, good Alexas.
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage.
Young boys and girls Are level now with men.
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for. 
Consent to swear.
Only I here importune death awhile, until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips.
Then open not thy lips.
I will, my lord.
It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Charmian!
Ay, but when?
Did he ask for me?
I shall devise something.
My Queen and Eros Have by their brave instruction got upon me A nobleness in record.
Farewell, and thanks.
Will you two help to hasten them?
Be ’t as our gods will have ’t.
Nor I.
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak, Your reconciler!
And the queen too, and that presently.
Armed, say you?
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me.
Why, Rosalind!
Your Emperor Continues still a Jove.
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
I am no villain.
Poisoned, then.
It shall be so.
He will come straight.
I’ll court his favors.
Prison, my lord?
There lay he, stretched along like a wounded knight.
You, as your business and desire shall point you— For every man has business and desire, Such as it is—and for my own poor part, Look you, I’ll go pray.
True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knolled to church, And sat at good men’s feasts and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engendered.
I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die.
That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind.
I have, since I was three year old, conversed with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
Though I am mad, I will not bite him.
What are you?
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw, And what thou think’st his very action speaks In every power that moves.
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more, And throw between them all the food thou hast, They’ll grind the one the other.
But next day I told him of myself, which was as much As to have asked him pardon.
Madam, I had rather seal my lips Than to my peril speak that which is not.
Were ’t twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name Since she was Cleopatra?
What did he when thou saw’st him?
You see how easily she may be surprised.
Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any.
Take each man’s censure but reserve thy judgment.
Thank God.” A good answer.
Exceedingly, my lord.
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
Oh, such another sleep, that I might see But such another man!
With all my heart, and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined.
I will weep.
We Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot.
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
I have said.
Fortune pursue thee!
When it appears to you where this begins, Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them.
Be happy.
Tis false.
Where is this sight?
Oh, rarely base!
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison.
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.
Mine ache to think on ’t. 
Not a whit, Touchstone.
Oh, ominous!
Welcome.
They’ll tell all.
It hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t, A brother’s murder.
Enobarbus, Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with His bounty overplus.
Forty thousand brothers Could not with all their quantity of love Make up my sum.
You will be whipped.
Hear me, good friends—
But let that go.
I know you are no truant.
Excellent well.
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death.
I fight against thee?
Oh yes, my lord.
Tweaks me by the nose?
Speak you so gently?
A thousand, sir, Early though ’t be, have on their riveted trim And at the port expect you.
My hearty friends, You take me in too dolorous a sense, For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you To burn this night with torches.
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Come, sit, sit, and a song.
That can I.
O Antony!
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where’s the soothsayer that you praised so to th’ Queen?
Is it your own inclining?
How now, Horatio?
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood.
For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you.
His beard was grizzled, no?
To see no pastime I.
But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart.
And you by land.
And fair words to them.
He.
Call my guard, I prithee.
His affections do not that way tend.
I am not taught to make anything.
Honest, my lord?
Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o’ th’ Nile By certain scales i’ th’ Pyramid.
Thou hast served me with much faith.
Not dead?
Go make thee ready; Our letters are prepared.
Tis not fit thus to obey him.
Tomorrow, soldier, By sea and land I’ll fight.
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both.
How does Hamlet?
I will fetch up your goats, Audrey.
Be not you ashamed to show, he’ll not shame to tell you what it means.
Oh, my pardon!
The king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.
Was not Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
What would she have?
Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks may concern Caesar.
Let that be left Which leaves itself.
If you do sorrow at my grief in love, By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermined.
No, by no means.
And I for no woman.
Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself.
It well appears.
Your grace hath laid the odds o' th' weaker side.
Look to the queen there, ho!
Make it so known.
Then is there mirth in heaven When earthly things, made even, Atone together.
You come most carefully upon your hour.
Not so.
I am constant to my purpose.
Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
Orlando?
Gentle cousin, Let us go thank him and encourage him.
Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make No wars without doors.
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.
Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome?
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
He was not sad, for he would shine on those That make their looks by his.
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayed for.
Oh, I die for food.
I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment, Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
Very good, my lord.
Then saw you not his face?
False, false.
Now shall you see the other.
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
I can live no longer by thinking.
If thou hast any sound or use of voice, Speak to me.
Hem them away.
I was the more deceived.
I give it you.
With his mouth full of news.
And I have heard Apollodorus carried—                                                                               What, I pray you?
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?
Welcome, my good Alexas.
Hast thou no care of me?
I will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.
You are welcome.
What is ’t thou say’st?
Ay, marry, is ’t.
Alas, then she is drowned.
In the corrupted currents of this world Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law.
Horns?
Farewell, kind master.
Begin you to grow upon me?
Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.
No more but e’en a woman, and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares.
I do love it better than laughing.
Thou art a soldier only.
But for the bloody napkin?
Look, my lord, it comes!
Nay, ’tis twice two months, my lord.
We’ll hear him what he says.
Treason!
Fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire.
No, truly.
Nothing.
I have performed Your pleasure and my promise.
Not when I saw ’t.
Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.
Begone!
We, ignorant of ourselves, Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers Deny us for our good, so find we profit By losing of our prayers.
This not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
As it determines, so Dissolve my life!
I must be idle.
Of what kind should this cock come of?
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean Shall outstrike thought, but thought will do ’t, I feel.
And thus a while the fit will work on him.
But what though?
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
Her hair, what color?
So take her to thee, shepherd.
Where is she?
For I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes.
Peace.
Let me see. 
What say you?
Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket.
The lady protests too much, methinks.
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love.
Yonder they lie, the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
This is most certain that I shall deliver: Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected.
I beseech you.
I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
I saw him yesterday”—or “t' other day,” Or then, or then, with such or such—“and, as you say, There was he gaming, there o'ertook in’s rouse, There falling out at tennis,” or, perchance, “I saw him enter such a house of sale”—   Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth.
Death of one person can be paid but once, And that she has discharged.
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
I do beseech you.
Tis pity of him.
Why have you stol’n upon us thus?
Tis a strange serpent.
Sir, his chests and treasure He has not with him.
Let our best heads Know that tomorrow the last of many battles We mean to fight.
I would thou couldst stammer, that thou might’st pour this concealed man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow-mouthed bottle—either too much at once, or none at all.
Nay, but this dotage of our general’s O’erflows the measure.
You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands.
I cannot live out of her company.
Time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons.
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack, With an entreaty, herein further shown, That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.
Hear it apart.
Our worser thoughts heavens mend.
Dolabella, I shall remain your debtor.
Why, thy godhead laid apart, Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?
Let’s to billiards.
Do, good William.
We have no friend But resolution, and the briefest end.
What is thy name, young man?
Very well, my lord.
Your servants tend.
Nay, but swear ’t.
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles, Thou diest for it.
It is very hot.
Why, what’s the matter?
Our fortune lies Upon this jump.
Indeed, he is so.
Will you be married, motley?
Wherein went he?
Caesar gets money where He loses hearts.
Heigh-ho.
Do you hear, masters?
Oh, the good gods!
And thus it may be.
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving, And blemish Caesar’s triumph.
I pray you, give me leave.
This was his basket.
Hath there been such a time—I would fain know that— That I have positively said, “'Tis so,” When it proved otherwise?
What, are they children?
Heavenly powers, restore him!
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle— O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
Woo’t weep?
Therefore this project
Bid her have good heart.
A beast, no more.
Why should I not?
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.
Hold, hold, my heart, And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up.
Yes, by heaven!
Then belike my children shall have no names.
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
By our beards (if we had them), thou art.
Fare you well.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Away, I do beseech you, both away.
Do, young sir.
You did know How much you were my conqueror, and that My sword, made weak by my affection, would Obey it on all cause.
Farewell!
Why?
At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark.
There’s strange news come, sir.
I prithee, who?
The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence.
Did you ever cure any so?
We have beat him to his camp.
Caesar, I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound With keels of every kind.
I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then he’s full of matter.
Here I am Antony, Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
O all you host of heaven!
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
In the name lay A moiety of the world.
For, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded.
What should we say, my lord?
You’ll heat my blood.
Ay, my lord.
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
No jewel is like Rosalind.
I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
Love?
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned.
Even this repays me.— We sent our schoolmaster.
What would my lord?
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius, Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea; But we keep whole by land.
Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending.
Is he gone?
Would you praise Caesar, say “Caesar.” Go no further.
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.
You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities.
Is it even so?
Tis well blown, lads.
But will my Rosalind do so?
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
Between who?
No, my lord.
I thank your lordship.
Bear’st thou her face in mind?
So I do.
But soft, but soft a while.
The concernancy, sir?
The star is fall’n.
Seest not?
Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removèd ground.
Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement.
Then does he say he lent me Some shipping, unrestored.
My friends told me as much, and I thought no less.
Proceed, proceed.
Content.
Know you before whom, sir?
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste, And get you from our court.
When did she send thee?
Tomorrow will we be married.
He threw his eye aside— And mark what object did present itself: Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched, ragged man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back.
So haply are they friends to Antony.
Come, instance.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor.
My dear master, My captain, and my emperor, let me say, Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
And you.
It is very sultry—as ’twere—I cannot tell how.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Be ruled.
Marry, now I can tell.
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here.
Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humor, and like enough to consent.
Madam!
By and by.
Nay, very pale.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn Most useful for thy country.
List, list, O, list!
There’s the point.
But do not go with it.
Remember thee!
Here’s sport indeed!
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
What is, my lord?
Well be with you, gentlemen.
And now I’ll do ’t.
This seen, Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
What news?
How say you, then?
In each thing give him way.
Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it.
Is this certain?
But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.
Therefore heaven nature charged That one body should be filled With all graces wide-enlarged.
