Go!
But I don’t get it—what’s the joke?
Damn you for mocking me.
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending, and I was born under the Big Dipper, so it’s inevitable that I’m rude and oversexed.
Edmund, you deserve me to be your woman.
Let’s see how.
It’s so scary to look down!
I know you.
Shut up, you doddering old wizard!
He’s a proper count, that Count Sugarplum, a sweet gentleman, for sure!
And when is he leaving?
Come on, come on.
Finally, after shaking my arm a little, and jerking his head up and down three times, he sighed like it was his last breath.
My lord?
A very clear way, but there is no friend who will undertake it.
I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over!
This, this All-Souls' day, is my just desserts.
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that?
Canidius, take our nineteen 
Young boys and girls are equal to men.
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest.
Whenever you like.
Aren’t you a rational human being?
Go, Pindarus, climb a little higher on this hill.
Look for him, Titinius, while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news.
Opportunity’s knocking for you, and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head.
What?
Well, good luck to them tonight in bed!
But you don’t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about.
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while.
What other rites are you going to give her?
Yes, Shylock, I’ll sign the contract and agree to its terms.
But  Hello, my lord, how have you been doing lately?
It doesn’t get seen enough; you should wear it in your cap, the way fools wear coxcombs.
What quality is that, my lord?
This ring, sir—oh no, it’s nothing.
Go back again, to be beaten home again?
Be quiet, be quiet.
Me too.
Hurry, go up to the roof.
It must be a spirit.
It’s impossible.
I don’t love Hermia; I love Helena.
No.
You certainly deserve it.
Honestly, it’s not as good as the other one, and I’m sure your cousin will agree with me.
Sir, I leave you to your own contentment.
Why do you come here?
Why are you here?
It’s a miracle you’re alive.
These vows are just traps for stupid birds.
Think about it.
If God had been willing, I wish we had died in the same hour too!
What’s going on these days?
He doesn’t have to care.
I’ll either fight you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused.
Why, Fool?
Let the envoy from Antony come in.
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk?
You have all served me well, and kings are your peers.     
I like doing things the old-fashioned way.
That’s out of tune, sir.
Claim fair England’s peace depends on this alliance.
Is there a murderer here?
Amen.
We’ll do what you want us to, my lord.
joy except my love for you, and I find that only your majesty’s love makes me happy.
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her, I’ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her.
Command this man to leave.
Oh, how stupid!
Nothing, my lord.
I love you as a child should love her father, neither more nor less.
The king and the prince are praying.
Who’s shouting?
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better.
You’ve served me faithfully.
Go in, and don’t cry.
Three words, dear Romeo, and then it’s good night for real.
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice.
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment, but you’re just making up feeble excuses. 
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor.
I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now.
What is it, Biondello?
Tell me, what does he think of our situation?
I’m telling you, you jerk priest, my sister will be an angel in heaven while you’re howling in hell.  
Yes, that’s true.
Like love, my lord, before it learns to love.
What did I do wrong?
Oh, Antony!
Romans, countrymen, and friends!
Carved it up and down like an apple tart?
I’ll give you a good reason to cringe, I promise you.
No!
So, there’s the signal to ride.
I’ll wait patiently.
Quiet there!
Where is my mother?
Here, here I’ll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids.
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me, like Egyptian puppets.
Good lord!
You thought about it too long, considering what you found there.
I’m not myself.
Let him thank me, who helped him get there.
He is as full of courage as of kindness, princely in both.
Quiet!
I didn’t realize he knew her.
Yes, my lord?
He spends most of his time with the good, noble Claudio.
Well, call them back again.
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five?
If I’m a wasp, look out for my stinger.
And he told us to follow him to the temple.
Do you want to exchange fathers?
We both have eaten as well, and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he.
Let him go, Gertrude.
Do I mistreat even my enemies?
Though he seems a little old-fashioned, there is much care and courage in this Welshman.
Well gentlemen, we’ve heard our assignment.
I wish you had my bones, and I had your news.
Yes, and he’ll keep getting funnier till he dies.
Who’s that calling?
I know that voice.
Here, sir, this is a ring she asked me to give you.
That awful, plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market.
I never saw her till now.
Start a fight?
I admire your efforts, and all of you will share the rewards.
We found him in the churchyard.
I don’t know who had him arrested, but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather.
Swear by her foot, so she can stamp out the oath.
Stand up.
Let me see—what do you think about falling in love?
In his heart?
Messala, today is my birthday—I was born on this very day.
I wouldn’t do that for the whole wide world.
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces.
Come on, woo me, woo me.
Your eyes are playing tricks on you.
I won’t betray them.
How did he get such an idea?
What does that have to do with my Lysander?
I have money in my purse and property at home, so I’m off to see the world.
My fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed.  
Romeo is hateful, even though God isn’t.
I thought everything out here was wild, which is why I acted so stern and commanding.
Tranio, I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath.
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence’s daughter.
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before.
I won’t trouble you so much as to wake you.
They have their exits and their entrances, and in his lifetime a man will play many parts, his life separated into seven acts.
Let me help you up.
What then?
As for your coming in to dinner, just do what you feel is right.
Look, you’ve got his wrinkled hands.
We cannot fight for love as men can.
So with no money, but a little more wisdom, I’m going back to Venice.
He called me Sebastian.
God bless you, Mr.
You come to me saying, “Shylock, we need money.” You say that!—even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you’d kick a stray mutt out your front door.
Now I’ll tell you the other story about my journey.
Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
Goodbye, my husband.
Excuse me, young man, how do I get to the Jew’s residence?
Haven’t you ever heard the saying, “Two can conspire to put one away”?
And I too?
That’s a good point.
The oars were made of silver, and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music.
Her bottom.
Here, Fluellen, stick this in your cap.
A man old Frederick, your father, loves.
No, I’ll be patient.
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels—senators, justices, common petitioners—will suffocate a feeble man almost to death.
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive, put together from shreds
Adultery?
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame.
The rules of dueling say he has to.
Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief!
No, please don’t hate him—for my sake.
But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.
Go!
When we’re born, we cry because we’ve arrived on the stage of life, like all the other fools.
Yes, indeed, bring them before me.
Whom should we look for in the castle?—Whose job is it?
Play me some music.
If I had the goddess Juno’s power, I would make the strong-winged messenger, Mercury, pick you up and seat you beside Jove.
Tell me, you villainous lowlife, where are my children?
Wasn’t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father?
Here’s some money for you.
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra’s sails.
Give me your hand, sir.
Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit, we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to. 
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance.
Come on, take us to him.
He’s offered me a lot of affection lately.
Spoken like a gentleman.
If I can tame him, I’ll charge as much as I can get for him.
I can’t believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death!
Did it stay a long time?
Stay, Jaques, stay here for a bit.
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead.
Yes.
You’re giving him a present?
I’ve made a risky investment.
Mine too.—Are you listening, monster?
And what’s the point, sir?
You dog, you peasant!
Well, brighter lights always dim the smaller ones.
No, longer than that.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
I saw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind.
So I won’t give or risk anything for lead.
And as wise as a goose.
Don’t provoke me any further or I’ll forget to restrain myself.
No, just listen to me.
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome.
We are, my lord.
We’ll leave, Brutus.
There’s no masquerade tonight.
Get away from here and leave me.
Who said that?
Go hide, Adam, and you’ll hear how he abuses me.
Your Grace can do whatever he wants.
I will advise him to speak as he usually does.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what did my love Romeo say?
If we’d fought like this before, we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads.
Hey, love, I say!
Who’s the ruler here?
It’s obvious:  Here comes Biondello.
What can I do for you, sir?
My lord, please go inside here.
While the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle.
Bolstered by righteousness, I prepared to fight, and when he saw my excitement—or perhaps because my shouting scared him—he ran away suddenly.
Well, by this I can see that you don’t love me as much as I love you.
As far as I know, he’s not even dead.
So it’s not my business that’s making me sad.
But a handkerchief— God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief!
What?
The muffled queen” is good.
I wrote a verse to this tune, though it’s not very imaginative.
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite.
Yes, you’re right, her name is Margery.
Oh, I know.
Don’t drive me crazy with curiosity, but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin, and why your tomb,
Carry him gently to bed, and every man be ready at his post when he awakes.
I’d say I was “out of my element,” but that phrase is overused, so I’ll say I’m “out of my air.”
Will you listen to me, Roderigo?
The first time we see the world as newborns, we cry and scream.
By the future.
All right, we’ll see you at dinnertime.
Oh, damn, damn, damn!
C’mon, make an effort.
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods.
In fact, I’d do even more to him than what you’ve heard him promise to do.
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love—as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death.
What do you think, Norfolk?
Please don’t take my niece the wrong way, sir.
I can tell your Majesty, the duke is a brave man.
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me.
Tell me, Voltemand, what’s the news from the king of Norway?
Yes, I truly think He did great good.
Come, tailor, show it to us.
That’s how Claudio will respond.
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value, but now I know her.
What’s the news?
He’s had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis.
It’s about you.
It is a trade, sir, that I practice with a clear conscience.
It is best to marry well and die young, better than to be married for a long time.
The king—whom I hope God will protect better than you would like—can’t get a minute’s rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints.
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men!
The French are still fighting.
My master is the great and rich Capulet, and if you don’t belong to the house of Montague, please come and drink a cup of wine.
A woman should always pick an older man.
But here she comes.
What captain do you serve?
Take this, too.
How amazing!
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart—you reveled in my lambs' bloody guts.
Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do.
Again!
My worthy lord, your noble friends miss your company.
My lord, I have news for you.
My lord, I know what I’m saying.
But Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man.
Whatever kind you want, I guess.
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy.
Only an hour ago it was nine, and in another hour it will be eleven.
I’ll wait for her here and when she comes I’ll take a novel approach with her.
Don’t tell us what our duty is.
Go find out the news.
Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him.
I’m at your service.
He leaves me to my own contentment, but that’s the one thing I cannot find.
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower.
If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, their men must all be drowned.
And yet I wouldn’t want to be you, uncle.
His wildness is a threat to all of us—to you, to me, to everyone.
Don’t give him time to catch his breath.
Stay in your cabins.
March to meet him at a dignified pace.
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness.
I’m not possessed!
We’ll see you tomorrow.
Isn’t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on?
As you please.
What do you say?
Well, should we hear some music?
The world doesn’t make laws to make you rich.
Who tricked you?
Fierce, fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war—ranks and squadrons—until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol.
Look and see.
That’s just what he said in the letter.
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings.
Yes, certainly.
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasn’t so free of jealousy.
So I guess it’s you, you silver treasure house.
Exactly, madam, until I sleep with you.
I’ve only done my duty.
Answer me this, please: where’s the money I gave you?
I wish you well.
I’ll change that name for you.
Oh my, Oh my!
Don’t.
Yes, boy.
Antonio!
Your servants are waiting.
All this conversing has turned men into tongues—and fancy ones, at that.
How could so many people, under two masters, get along under one roof?
What’s important is to be prepared.
Didn’t you hear it?
In cash.
He’s a stylish man.
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him!
I’ll tell him, my lord.
A greater gift?
Drawing your sword on a woman?
I’ve promised them I would, and they’re expecting it.
I had only one child, one poor child, one poor and loving child, the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself, and cruel Death has stolen it from me!
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him.
I’ll talk with this good man.
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me.
Your son Edward, who stabbed my son Edward, is dead.
A friend should put up with his friend’s weaknesses, but you exaggerate mine.
Shall we not?
Both?
So goodbye until we meet again.
These two Antipholuses, who look so alike—and these two Dromios, who seem to have the same face—and her story of being shipwrecked—why, these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident.
Come on, what would you say about me?
What prisoners of rank have been taken, uncle?
You speak so highly of fools!
Then my love is humble.
He’s walking over there, sir.
It’s new to you.
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn’t be as ready to die as I am now.
Either we go after Pompey or he’ll come after us. 
Yes, I do, sir.
How smooth and cool they seem!
I can tell by the way you waggle your head.
What’s it to you?
I want very much to find out.
Sit down for a while, and we’ll tell you again the story you don’t want to believe, about what we’ve seen two nights now.
I know how they think, and I understand why they’re doing this.
They are.
Fair princess, you’ve missed some good sport.
Oh, lady, speak again.
He’s a very dishonest, puny boy, and more cowardly than a rabbit.
No, I said his horse is coming, with him on its back.
It’s almost four.
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard.
He who chooses me will get what many men want.” What many men want—that “many” could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy.
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer.
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve, saying, “Tomorrow is 
Why are you crying?
The container of that great soul is now cold.
What do you want?
Protect me, my friends.
No, I don’t, my lord.
This is the place.
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have.
What’s going on, Juliet?
It’s time for me to say goodbye to you.
Hurry!
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne.
Won’t King Richard let me speak with him?
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances.
Go to him, Sir Topas.
Oh, she shows the torches how to burn bright!
I’ll tell her.
Why, his cuckold’s horns, of course—the kind you men are always blaming on your wives.
I’m hoping my holy mood will pass.
What’s going on between you two?
Are you always going to be like this?
Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
Anything I did to you, I did it because Sir Toby made me.
Those are her orders.
I won’t be hit, my lord.  
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray?
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference, for—to be honest, though it’s probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage—my men are considerably weakened by illness, my numbers reduced, and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen, though when they were in good form, I tell you, herald, I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs.
Gertrude, don’t drink that.
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered?
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me.
But here’s an old, true saying: “If you want to win France, start with Scotland.” For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey, the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and, like the mouse when the cat’s away, destroy more than she can actually eat.
Yet he seems capable.
If his cause is wrong, our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it.
If you shut the windows, it will pour out the keyhole.
Get out of here!
There, my lord.
Now get out of here!
I will not take it.
Thieves!
He’s very bright.
The one who makes her queen, of course.
Now, Titania, wake up, my sweet queen.
Cheer up and be at peace.
Run and proclaim it in the streets.
Where is Gloucester?
Oh, dainty duck!
Shame on you; I’ve already run out of patience with you all.
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses.
But don’t take all that pain on yourself.
Oh, goodbye to my peace of mind!
Please, don’t mention her.
Are we bothering you?
Dissolute lowlife, you shall die.
This is the place.
Where else should his eyes be, if not in his head?
Then everything must really be finished.
He who will not follow me now, let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp, cap in hand, while some slave, no nobler than my dog, violates his daughter.
If you refuse it, the whole country will regret it.
We’re probably a very valuable catch for these guys.
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations, then you can come with us.
You drank horses’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse.
Damn it!
And when I get my reward, I’ll get out of here.
Fool, I’ll repay you for this favor.
If I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying.
Come on, Sir Andrew, there’s nothing you can do about it.
Help!
He was in bed with— With her?
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion.
What’s the difference?
Do you recognize my voice, noble lord?
Puppet”?
Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a freakshow, just like they do with deformed animals.
We’re close enough now.
Error in the bill, sir, error in the bill!
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship.” That’s some sharp, critical satire, and it’s not appropriate for a wedding.
Oh I hope that’s not true!
I’d endure it until he came home again.
My own ears heard it, and you know it.
Soldier, you are.
Well, let’s move on to our work with the living.
I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys.
We’ll give you an answer tomorrow.
Good Enobarbus, you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly.
For heaven’s sake, help me!
He does, and now he’s taking revenge on you—for breaking promises and for murder, too.
know myself!
What’s your answer?
Nothing, Messala.
He’s welcome too.
Now let my courage prove my title as wife.
I’ll leave you for now.
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions.
Are you trying to make fun of me?
Yes.
Please, somebody, get us out of here!
Then I’ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow.
How dare you tell us about God’s laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself?
Oh-ho-ho, kid!
He can’t give his house away to his daughters, leaving himself without shelter.
No, she’s worse: she’s the devil’s mother, and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench.
I’m off.
So now turn and draw your sword.
And I’ll tell him about the letter too.
The king won’t live, I hope.
Hello, mortal!
Wake up, wake up, ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens.
Where do you come from?
Go, but sign the deed.
But try to control your speech.
Let’s have the evidence.
But since you come from him, you’re saturated with his healing spirit.
For God’s sake, my lord, let’s be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince.
Hello, Iago.
I don’t know you.
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow.
See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity.
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger.
Curse you!
I know it’s foolish to be so much in love, but I can’t help it.
Oh, uncle, it’s better to smile and flatter indoors where it’s dry than get soaked out here.
Oh, now you weep, and I sense that you feel pity.
But the enemy is loud.
You’ve seen these illusions.
That fair-skinned, hard-hearted hussy, Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane.
Oh God, remember to hear her prayer for them, just as for us!
You think about him too much.
The law has another hold on you.
If you ever had a mother, come in quickly to Sir John.
There go the minstrels.
There’s no ambiguity here.
I’ll give him equal thanks, so we’re even.
I’ll get it from you, I swear.
Absolutely everything.
Ah sir, ah sir.
In two months—a month before this loan is due—I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments.
You hit my servants, and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants.
Where is his body, Messala?
Oh, heaven help us!
I can’t talk about my happiness anymore.
Keep myself?
Anger does not protect the angry well.
Yes, go ahead and moan, because you killed the sweetest, most innocent woman who ever lived!
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me, and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate.
It’s terrifying.
My noble lords and relatives, good morning.
And so farewell.
What, is trusting a friend such a crime?
But where have you been?
Ah, you’re here?—Come on, gentlemen, let’s go!
If you see anything else, let me know.
Therefore my sadness is without limit.
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights.
They shouted three times.
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them—and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house.
Well, Brutus, you’re noble.
They should advance immediately, because I sense Octavius’s side is a bit fainthearted right now, and a sudden push would overthrow him.
All I’m asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew.
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died.
Did you accompany Caesar home?
But life itself, my wife, and the whole world aren’t more valuable to me than your life is.
Oh, forgive all my sins!
If you come to me after tomorrow and say, “That’s my glove,” I swear by this hand, I will take it and give you a box on the ear.
Thank you, sir.
But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while.
Yes, what about him?
I’d rather adopt a child than have one of my own.—Come here, Moor.
But Macbeth is.
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain?
Isn’t he getting funnier?
Well, if you have to go, you have to go.
Madam, madam— Antony’s dead!
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her.
Give me some applause, if we’re friends, and Robin will make everything up to you.
Yes, sir.
What did you mean by not helping me?
Yes, I forgot—three months. 
I’m surprised I didn’t bite back.
Good morning, worthy Caesar.
I didn’t hear anything.
Me neither.
How are you?
But like I said, on the night of Lammas Eve, she will be fourteen.
If I’m not dreaming, you are Emilia.
Yes, my master.
Do you want to hear it again?
Come here, Proculeius.
Oh, I wish I could make a  My soul is calling out my name.
Will you come to bed, my lord?
He said that the people weren’t used to being spoken to except by the  What blocks of wood!
How dare you talk about kindness or shame.
That’s what the Prince and my fiancé say.
What?
It’s gone.
I think I can find him.
More and more pain for us.
If you mutiny against me, I’ll hang you from the next tree.
What, are you afraid?
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs.
I’m indebted to you forever.
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself.
He has always loved Cordelia best, and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious.
Come here!
You’ve humiliated him, lady: you’ve put him down.
In that case you should sleep.
I was told that by one who knows him better than you.
I won’t bother you.
Farewell.
Never trust me again if I don’t.
Send a message to his brother.
I’m the ghost of your father, doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night, while during the day I’m trapped in the fires of purgatory until I’ve done penance for my past sins.
For it is written in the book of Numbers: “When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, claim what is yours.
I know it’s the sun that shines so bright.
Go.
Make sure everyone knows that.
Keep my lover quiet.
God forbid he wants to challenge me!
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea, leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire.
Nah, I don’t care what their 
Fulvia’s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return.
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
Well then, I’ll do it.
Please, sir, hurry up.
Do you have it with you?
Yes, sweet Rosalind.
Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.
To bed, to bed!
And shall our lively blood, quickened by wine, be so frosty?
You don’t want to eat, sir?
Because when rich villains need poor villains' services, those poor ones can name the price.
Is this the Prince’s brother?
I know he’s noble, rich, young, and with a fine reputation.
If you look closely at Alexander’s life, Harry of Monmouth’s stands up fairly well by comparison—for there are analogies in everything.
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things.
So be careful.
Sir, I tell you that we are not.
It might as well be the same with Caesar.
Tybalt, old Capulet’s nephew, has sent a letter to Romeo’s father’s house.
Let me lick your shoe.
Please, go away.
I ask you, if you have a grudge against me, to kill me now, while your stained hands still reek of blood.
Will it be in thunder, lightning, or rain?
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me, you try to take advantage of my affection.
If I do so, it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face.
Come with me, my dear Cordelia.
It’s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents.
Tybalt was my dearest cousin.
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality.
Don’t worry, I won’t.
My lord, the mayor of London is here to greet you.
Yes, that’s me.
Don’t cry, don’t cry.
You, Roderigo!
Pick up the corpses.
Besides, according to the French historians, King Pepin, who deposed Childeric, based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild, the daughter of King Clothair.
Why?
Thank you.
I’ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over.
Give our officers notice of our intentions.
How did he look?
I’ll give the Jew my flesh, blood, bones, and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me.
He’s gone?
Even more since you annexed my father’s house and lands.
Teach me how I should think and speak.
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it.
Let me enjoy my privacy.
I’ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too.
You speak more wisely than you know.
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him, or that the church is supported by your drum because it “stands by” your drum.
So be quiet.
As it is God’s will and pleasure, Captain, I entreat you to come quickly to the king.
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning”—please, tell me what you meant by that.
Yes, but swear by my sword this time.
Tell me.
It’s no use!
Look, it’s waving me over again.
The king, his brother, and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind, and the rest are grieving over them, sad and astonished.
Did he ask about me?
Oh painful sympathy!
Her
The name suits your fierceness.
But, oh, it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man’s eyes.
The fool’s a good actor.
A friend?
If he hadn’t, we’d all be embarrassed to look at him.
Age won’t wither her, and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring.
Speak, speak.
Besides, our hands are hard and calloused.
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me.
That’s true.
Is this the cure for my aching bones?
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio.
Come here.
He rejected my authority as much as yours.
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever, and will make me, Caliban, your worshipful foot-licker.
who can control his fate?
It’s a pity that fools aren’t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do.
My back aches too—
He’ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more.
I hope you haven’t lost your mind.
Oh yes.
Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her.
Stand back.
Sadness and despair!
Why didn’t the jerk come back to me when I called him?
Give him a noose to hang himself.
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion.
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice, and left him there in a trance.
No, first let’s talk to him.
Are you Tyrrel?
Madam, not yet.
And there’s another storm brewing—I can hear it in the way the wind whistles.
How about it, Corporal Nym?
You are your father’s daughter.
He’s lying through his teeth!
There were enough Christians before—as many of them as could stand to live near each other.
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this: if his position is furthered, his character will fulfill these predictions.
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather.
Sister, be happy in my unhappiness.—Sir, I will humbly obey you.
What men have you lost, Fluellen?
It’s as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea, and it can swallow as much as the sea can.
But you’ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them.
Therefore, love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they’re saying the least, in my opinion.
Come on!
Young budding virgin, fair and pure and sweet, where are you off to?
I swear to you by Rosalind’s own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man.
Kiss her soft mouth, and we’ll be off.
Oh, sweet mermaid, don’t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister’s tears.
I haven’t seen anything.
Please calm down, uncle.
I’m telling you, get out of here, and don’t follow me around like this.
I beg you, daughter, don’t make me crazy.
But tell me this: don’t you know my voice?
I’ll write down what she says, so I’ll remember it better.
Beat them down!
Do you need my help?
Her curses have made my hair stand on end.
The wine of life has been poured out, and only the dregs remain.
You seasoned his food with screams.
Dinner is over, and we’re going to get there too late.
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen, the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner’s goods.
Break it up.” Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down.
No, it’s a story.
My lord, I don’t think I cried out.
Are you on duty again tonight?
The great emperor Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might plug up a hole to keep the wind away.
Do that, and I’ll set you free in two days.
I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
If you regard it as shameful, put the shame on me.
But did you tell him she cheated on him?
How’s it going, Shylock?
Margaret, run into the sitting room.
What does the golden box say?
Maybe you should ask, what will you do for a husband?
Lead me to where you’re standing.
And so, good-bye.
Then, at my farm I have a hundred milk cows, a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables, and all the equipment necessary to maintain them.
Now I’m starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated.
In that case, the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good.
Well, we’ve missed the beginning; it’s dead and buried.
Oh no!
If he can keep it, he’ll be set forever.
And then I’ll be the leader of pain, and maybe I’ll lead you as far as death.
He’d better not speak badly of Brutus here.
Unfaithful, my lord?
Even though everything evil wants to look good, good still has to look good too.
The wolves have finished preying for the night, and look—the gentle dawn is rising, dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light.
Any news from Genoa?
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me, then I’d stir you up, and install in each of Caesar’s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny.
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds.
I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this!
Is the single man lucky, then?
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep.
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France.
Like a fire that gets covered up, Benedick should smother his love and waste away.
Don’t you, Dromio?
I don’t really understand what you mean.
Pish to you, you mangy dog, you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt.
I’m Lorenzo, your love.
But for your private satisfaction, because I love you, I’ll tell you.
It’s disgraceful!
If that’s not enough, I’ll sign a contract to pay ten times that much, and I’ll give you my hands, my head, and my heart as security.
And the poor old man just wept, mixing his tears with the rain.
Come here, good Volumnius.
Night is over, and day is coming.
I should always be wise.
Is Antonio here?
Help me out of here, quickly!
I’m not that stupid.
Tell me how.
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave.
That’s not holy, it’s heresy.
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches.
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest.
So will we all.
I know that young men look forward to their rest.
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman, and, to tell you the truth, he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man.
Yes, she will.
Not now.
Damn it!
The second I saw you, my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave, so here I am now, a patient log-man.
Don’t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword.
I’ve got some business to take care of.
Richmond is sailing on the sea.
Let me tell you, the man who marries her will become very wealthy.
If it were nothing, you wouldn’t need to hide it.
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin?
Lecherous Cleopatra, may all the charms of love soften those withered lips!
Please, my king, be quiet.
Control yourself, my precious Queen, and concede that my love is true.
Not for a second.
A ghost, a ghost!
Then have your servants bring him out.
Don’t follow me.
There it is.
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up.
Where should we stable our horses?
Look out, here she comes.
Please, don’t make fun of me.
He lost both, my lord.—Ma'am, this letter is from your sister, and needs an immediate answer.  
Oh, Cassius, Brutus gave the orders too soon.
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door.
Come on, then.
We’re bound to each other in every possible way, except we need you to marry us.
Many of you own slaves, which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them.
The spirit is torturing me.
Are you blushing?
It’s the death of half the world. 
That’s more than we know.
It’s fair game to mark a coward.
Let’s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner.
We’re sorry to hear this.
What’s this part for?
Get ready for the third hit, Laertes.
That’s what her mother always tells me.
I swear, I love you.
No more than a minute?
Therefore, all lovers should speak for themselves.
Here, you there, Grumio.
And I your servant.
Oh my God, what a terrible world this is!
Come in out of the storm.
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together.
Get out of my sight, or I’ll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar’s victory.
Ding, dong, bell.
Uncle, this man is a Montague—our enemy.
Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.
You unwashed farmworker!
No, afterward.
That’s definitely too old.
And, being men, the contents of Caesar’s will would enrage you.
Oh, shut up!
You wrong me in every way.
We will.
Oh, no.
Poor Antony!
Thank you, sir.
Life’s better at 
If love is blind, it can’t hit the target.
A sweet woman!
That’s enough about that.
I don’t think so.
No, come on, don’t make me play a woman.
What is this?
Get away from me, Satan!
In the first act he is an infant, whimpering and puking in his nurse’s arms.
The poor thing, I really think she loves me.
God help me, I love you!
Let me shake your hand.
Unhappy fortune!
She’s not feeling well.
I’d try it, if I could cry “hem” and have him.
Oh, but she’ll keep her word.
I had to hurry to my love, beautiful Helena, who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars.
Come here, you wretch!
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls, and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal.
Come on, take control of your feelings.
We need a calendar!
I don’t have that kind of reputation!
But don’t be afraid, Cesario.
If you had, the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you.
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch.
They’ll kill us!
If this is so, be patient, sister.
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France.
Can I have a word with you, Lucillius?
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her.
No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it.
Victory is with us.
I beg you to pardon me.
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me.
It is, my lord.
Let me embrace you.
Have his daughters made him crazy like this?—Couldn’t you have kept something for yourself?
God bless you.
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell?
I admit that he’s murderous, lecherous, greedy, lying, deceitful, violent, malicious, and guilty of every sin that has a name.
Hey!
I know he wouldn’t be a wolf if the Romans didn’t act like sheep.
You still haven’t said anything incriminating.
Why are you whipping that whore?
So were you.
He really is the most skillful, bloodthirsty, and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria.
Now, Catesby, what does your lord say to my request?
I’m going to make you a rich man.
My lord, welcome this man.
I am the son of Marcus Cato!
When they see the face of Caesar, they will vanish.
Won’t he?
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools.
But aren’t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick?
Such a kind father!—Are my horses ready?
What do you have to say for yourself, Hermia?
Are you thinking about me?
it pleases you, I’ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime.
Yes indeed it is, sir.
But why do you keep me here so long?
Maybe she can’t find him.
Yes.
I pick the younger one.
I don’t know.
Me too.
When I first heard about him, he was still a bachelor.
You and I, Kate, we are the makers of custom, and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize, as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss.
She’s calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her, just like I murdered her relative.
Enjoy your frankness; it suits you.
No, sir, I live by the church.
No one here is affected by your curse, because curses are just words with no power.
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff’s deputy.
My lord, you’re wrong to berate her like that.
I can’t believe it.” The tears fell from her eyes like holy water.
There is a river in Macedon, and there is likewise a river in Monmouth.
Let their beds be as soft as yours, and let them eat the same food as you”?
I can’t, my lord.
Sing us a song.
He’s still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise, though he puts on this show of stupidity.
Are they likely to get dusty?
The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough.
You are my love, my love, I think.
Let’s say goodbye to him.
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so.  
You can’t trust anyone who abuses her own father, her flesh and blood.
Thank you.
I’ll have my head cut from my shoulders before I’ll see the crown so misplaced.
Let’s do it with no show of anxiety—no, with no more fear than if we’d heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing.
Demetrius doesn’t think so, and that’s all that matters.
And then she brought me up, and I thank her for that, too.
What’s your name, friend?
I have a list of all the important men.
I mean, what sort of man is he?
Help me, ladies!
Tell me once more what you say.
Any strange beast there can be considered a man.
They will tell me more, because I’m determined to know the worst about what’s going to happen.
What, my lord?
I sink under the heavy weight of love.
I’ll stand, and so will Trinculo.
We three are married, but you two are defeated.
I’ll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning.
I’ll kill him!
Is all of this about your father?
Obey your parents, keep your word, don’t swear, don’t sleep with another man’s wife, and don’t covet flashy clothes.
No, it hasn’t, my lord.
Why are you asking me that?
She had put a wreath of fresh, fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead, and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass.
I’ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before, and for far less reason.
Very much so.
We’re wasting time here.
Is he crazy with love for you?
Is that chain you’re wearing the one you promised to give to me?
It is well done, and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings.
Macbeth has come.
So that England may live a long life like this, let God say amen!
Grief seems to be contagious, for my eyes, seeing the tears in yours, began to fill.
Caesar resents me, but he loves Brutus.
Usually fathers produce children, not the other way around.
Just now, my lord.
Please, stop bowing, good sir.
Then die and be damned!
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid.
Wait, Petruchio, I should go with you.
He’s married to Octavia, madam.
Not explicitly, but so what?
It applies to you as much as to me, my lord.
Apparently you think there’s nothing unusual about a bloody head.
It must be.
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio.
Are you trying to remake me?
I remember, Adam, that’s  Here comes my master, your brother.
Lurk out of sight.
How did you two get separated?
Is that a tradition?
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister.
And brief, good mother—I’m in a hurry.
No, the legs and thighs.
Tell them this, Publius.
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now?
Tie him up harder.—You filthy traitor!
The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky.
You are dead!
I don’t care what you think of me.
My dear lord, tell me what’s bothering you.
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news.
How could he be in debt without me knowing it?
But I can’t be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother, young George.
But gods, you give us faults so we’ll be human.
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes, and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows.
What’s the matter with you?
Now, Baptista, let’s turn to your younger daughter.
Yes, I have great cause to be thankful.
Pick me up.
Will you come?
No, not a bit.
What do you want from me, my good man?
Four legs and two voices—a very special monster.
I’ve destroyed my reputation, a most shameful error.
Did you have to give them everything?
Look, here comes the duke.
And when will you see him again?
I remember.
Oh, I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could!
A prison like that would give me enough liberty.  
I’ll give you a greater gift than that, nephew.
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king?
That’s a poor example.
Young gentleman, you are too bold for your age.
It’s still a long time until daybreak.
Forgive me, your grace.
