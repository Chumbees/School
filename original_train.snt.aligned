Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
O sinful thought!
I answer you?
Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him tomorrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation.
Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
Go to.
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life.

I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
Call in the messengers.
O brave touch!
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law, Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

In this last tempest.
But speak, Egeus.

My cousin Westmoreland?
Iago is most honest.
Sit, worthy friends.
Pindarus, Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground.
O damned Iago!
Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?
Nay, come, I prithee.
She swoons to see them bleed.
Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?
I have noted it well.
Haply in private.
Content you, gentlemen.
Therefore be patient.
What makes that frontlet on?
Welcome home, Grumio.
You thought because he could not speak English in the native garb, he could not therefore handle an English cudgel.
Romeo slew Tybalt.
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
Impart.
Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel.
I am in my condition A prince, Miranda—I do think, a king; I would, not so!—and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth.

Sblood, an arrant traitor as any ’s in the universal world, or in France, or in England!
Go, go.
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras.
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting.
Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity.
Why, Rosalind!
Oh, my fortunes have Corrupted honest men!
Perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
The man is notwithstanding sufficient.
What years, i' faith?
Give me thy hand, Messala.
I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice.
To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
Most like a gentleman.

Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
Jailer, look to him.
She mocks all her wooers out of suit.

I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.
What concern they?
Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice.
There would this monster make a man.
Quickly let me have it.

You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man.
Our instruments to melancholy bells, Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast.
Sister, where thou?
Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following it.

I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking, So full of valor that they smote the air For breathing in their faces, beat the ground For kissing of their feet—yet always bending Towards their project.
Oh, you are men of stones.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Come, good Athenian.
Peace, Grumio.
They have made him drink alms-drink.
That’s mercy, but too much security.
Trust me, I fear it has.
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine Nor age so eat up my invention Nor fortune made such havoc of my means Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends But they shall find, awaked in such a kind, Both strength of limb and policy of mind, Ability in means and choice of friends, To quit me of them throughly.
That’s a degree to love.
Therefore then, thou gaudy gold, Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee.
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading, Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate, whose right Suits not in native colors with the truth; For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation
They know By th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth Or foison follow.
Ha, banishment!
Who does do you wrong?
Myself?
Not dead?

Out, tawny Tartar, out!
My lord, in Athens.
The gods reward your kindness!
Foolish wench, To th' most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels.
Here, noble lord.
Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this, Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
Mistress!
Romeo’s a dishclout to him.
There is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
Your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust, and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will.
It must be thought on.
Go look after him.
Sure we thank you.
Oh, he hath murdered his master!
Minion, your dear lies dead, And your unblest fate hies.
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child.
Tis brief, my lord.
What were these?
Your Highness told me I should post before.
If this prove A vision of the Island, one dear son Shall I twice lose.
I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a- night to Jane Smile.
Proceed.
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers.
Caesar’s.
Their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
But oh, poor Gloucester— Lost he his other eye?
I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.
Most certain.
I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say, “I love you.” Then if you urge me farther than to say, “Do you, in faith?” I wear out my suit.
We would have all such offenders so cut off, and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
With one fool’s head I came to woo, But I go away with two.— Sweet, adieu.
You call me misbeliever, cutthroat dog, And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine— And all for use of that which is mine own.
Oh , stay but till then!
No, none by me.
Bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue.
Nay, come, let’s go together.
Fie, there is no such man.
Fathers that wear rags  Do make their children blind.
I have forgot your name, but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally performed.
And here’s another, whose warped looks proclaim What store her heart is made on.
No, truly not, although until last night I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
Now all is well.
Neither, my lord.
Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper, My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow More than my brother: “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester, “Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.” And since, methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
But lest my liking might too sudden seem, I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
And I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
Mistress, how mean you that?
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
And now to our French causes.
No.
I warrant you, madam.
Hence, and stand aloof.
A good knave.
They fell together all, as by consent.
Let me speak a little.
Talkers are no good doers.
I give them with this ring, Which when you part from, lose, or give away, Let it presage the ruin of your love
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit.
A most scurvy monster.
With good acceptance of his Majesty— Save that there was not time enough to hear, As I perceived his Grace would fain have done, The severals and unhidden passages Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms, And generally to the crown and seat of France, Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?
The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there—filial ingratitude.
Well, then I shall see thee again?
Oh, but I fear.
I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.
I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry “Cock-a-diddle-dow.” Where should this music be?
And never, since the middle summer’s spring, Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, By pavèd fountain, or by rushy brook, Or in the beachèd margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.
My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
O most unhappy strumpet!
No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son, for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.
Your hands, come then.
A sleeve?
Said you so?
You know me by my habit.
Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
That eye my daughter lent her; ’tis most true.
When I desire their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house, charged me on pain of their perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him.

And they are gone.
Upon mine honor, Myself, my brother, and this grievèd count Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain, Confessed the vile encounters they have had A thousand times in secret.
There is some strange misprision in the princes.
I am not sorry neither.
Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named.
Then be ’t so, my good lord.— How does the king?
Here comes the Emperor.
I one, my lord.
You English princes all, I do salute you.
Your royal preparation Makes us hear something.
Ay, my lord.
A carrion death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll.
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
I serve you, madam.
Ho, let the door be locked.
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of “father” Pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart, Cried, “Sisters, sisters!
Come, sir, I will not let you go.
Come on!
I know her father, though I know not her, And he knew my deceasèd father well.
The shrill-gorged lark so far Cannot be seen or heard.
O, in the duke of Gloucester’s purse.
These three world-sharers, these competitors, Are in thy vessel.
They are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.
Come not near Casca.
Hark.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative.
Nay, then thou lov’st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof.

How many months Do you desire?
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
What, must our mouths be cold?
Madam!
Good Sir Toby!
I’ll be before thee.
Alack, poor gentleman!
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.— Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed!
My father, poorly led?
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Sir?
Goes the king hence today?
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
It proves not so.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost.
A fox when one has caught her And such a daughter Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter.
I am very sorry that you are not well.
I robbed his wound of it.
Come, go with me.
Boy!
Thou shalt not live, That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies, And sleep in spite of thunder.
You, you, sirrah, where’s my daughter?
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
Do so.
Hoo!
Twas you we laughed at.
I love you the better; the hearers may cry “Amen.” God match me with a good dancer!
My husband, then?
It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known.
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
Oh, my dear Cassio!
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
Nothing could have subdued nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
Give me thy torch, boy.
Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.
Good morrow, noble sir.
I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp, And the rich East to boot.
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.
Here, stand behind this bulk, straight will he come.
Away!
How doth the prince?
Let’s speak to him.
Tis worse than murder To do upon respect such violent outrage.
Is Brutus sick?
What, think you we are Turks or infidels?
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
They’ll tell all.
Com’st thou again for ransom?
I serve as good a man as you.
My visor is Philemon’s roof; within the house is Jove.
Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own.
Is ’t not strange?
And so I am, I am.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us, But speak all good you can devise of Caesar, And say you do ’t by our permission.
How does the queen?
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
Cheerly, boys.
I will have it all mine.
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
All this done, Repair to Pompey’s porch, where you shall find us.
Raise up the Montagues.
I’ll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour.
As for my wife, I would you had her spirit in such another.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun, and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
I must discontinue your company.
If he were dead, what would betide on me?
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew, Thou makest thy knife keen.
Pray you, be careful.
I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.
Good faith, and when I met this holy man, The men you talk of came into my mind.

You say very true, scald knave, when God’s will is.
You must not deny me.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge.
Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
Fortune is an excellent moral.
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
Shall we be sundered?
But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads.
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down.
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
And, good night, sweet friend.
Ninus' tomb,” man.
If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.
Stand, ho!
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
Romeo.
Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them, all prisoners, sir, In the line grove which weather-fends your cell.
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
We Have used to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
What soldiers, whey-face?
Send out more horses.
Folded the writ up in form of th' other, Subscribed it, gave ’t th' impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known.
We’ll hear it, Antony.
I lay with Cassio lately And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep.
I will chop her into messes!
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
Speak.
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say, “These are their reasons.
I drink to thee.
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
A touch, a touch, I do confess ’t.
She had a song of “Willow,” An old thing ’twas, but it expressed her fortune And she died singing it.
For these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors, they do always reason themselves out again.
Let but the commons hear this testament— Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read— And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood, Yea, beg a hair of him for memory, And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue.
God will revenge it, whom I will importune With earnest prayers, all to that effect.
And you too, sir.
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
Not know me yet?
There, my blessing with thee.
Come, shall I make you two friends?
Draw together.
I would not marry her, though she were endowed with all that Adam had left him before he transgressed.
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear I never more will break an oath with thee.
This ’tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.
Hymen from heaven brought her, Yea, brought her hither, That thou mightst join her hand with his Whose heart within his bosom is.
Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you.
Masters, play here, I will content your pains.
Alas, poor ghost!
I will bring you thither.
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.
There’s another garment for ’t.
Not if the small come first.
Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.
Out of my sight!
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry, I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juicèd flowers.
Who?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
I have it not about me.
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb.
My necessaries are embarked.
Call Philostrate.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself into stitches, follow me.
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury?
He is much changed.
And then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.
And so good morrow to you every one.
Thus ornament is but the guilèd shore To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty—in a word, The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest.
O infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from The world’s great snare uncaught?

Our knocking has awaked him.
The fault’s your own.
Let’s ha ’t, good soldier.

Octavia weeps To part from Rome.
The duke is humorous.
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
Let’s draw our weapons.
Sir, He is with Caesar.
I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offense too.
I will verify as much in his beard.
More knocking.
Lord of lords!
A piece of ice.
A match!
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
Come, be a man.
Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel; And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich, And very rich.
To be your fellow You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant Whether you will or no.

Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun.
Mistress, we have.
The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides.

But, alas the while!
Ay, are you thereabouts?
But, sir, forgive me, Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you.
False, false.

And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando?

But repetition of what thou hast marred.
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?
Woe, woe for England!
If he cannot, let the botcher mend him.

The gods best know—                                              Oh never was there queen So mightily betrayed!
What hast thou found?
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.
For my dinner.
Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
If our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.
Thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind, That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.
O Regan, she hath tied Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here.
Where should she be?
I hear him mock The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath.—Husband, I come!
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.
When saw you my father last?
Lay on, Macduff, And damned be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!” I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
I do not find that thou deal’st justly with me.
Not that I love you not.
Oh, the heavens!
Give the word, ho, and stand.
Like one of two contending in a prize That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes, Hearing applause and universal shout, Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt Whether these pearls of praise be his or no— So, thrice fair lady, stand I even so, As doubtful whether what I see be true Until confirmed, signed, ratified by you.
Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
The next Caesarion smite, Till by degrees the memory of my womb, Together with my brave Egyptians all, By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey!
Oh, no, good Kate.
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge Cry “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”
If much you note him, You shall offend him and extend his passion.
I rest much bounden to you.
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand.
Ha, ha, heard in Genoa.
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept.
Here Catesby comes again.
Descend, brother, I say.
Thus says my king: “Say thou to Harry of England, though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.
The last was I that felt thy tyranny.

Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown.
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich.
Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is, in the vulgar, “leave”—the society—which in the boorish is “company”—of this female—which in the common is “woman”; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage.

Art thou gone so, love, lord?
I have promised to make all this matter even.
I do not think so.
Have patience, madam.

Madam my interpreter, what says she?

But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, Your buskined mistress and your warrior love, To Theseus must be wedded, and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity.

So the spirit is eased.
Now, banished Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned, So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest, Shall find thee full of labors.
I fly, Biondello.
As good cause as one would desire.
My purposes do draw me much about.

And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favor at thy gracious hand, Thou dost confirm his happiness forever.
I can no more.
Oh, come apace, dispatch!
But if she cannot love you, sir?
Well, again.
Lady!
And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today.
O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
And what your Highness suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine, for, had you been as I took you for, I made no offense.
I will hear that play.

Too late, good Diomed.

Report is changeable.
Lips, do not move; No man must know.”
Well I know the man.
I charge thee, tempt me not.
Why, how now?
So much for praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy.
Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant.
Kent, on thy life, no more.
What, my old worshipful old master?
Ha!
The cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger.
Is there any way to show such friendship?

Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue, Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
The meantime, lady, I’ll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother.
Thou strik’st not me, ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, That I may see my shadow as I pass.
I have it ready for thee.

What do you here alone?
An interlude!
All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star, But none can help our harms by wailing them.— Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; I did not see your Grace.

Where the devil should this Romeo be?
I am armed and well prepared.— Give me your hand, Bassanio.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night?
Fortune is merry, And in this mood will give us anything.
You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats.
Good morrow, General.
I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
Master, master!
It is offended.
You have her father’s love, Demetrius.
How now, worthy soldier?

Where is my lord?

My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, Though I should swear I saw ’t.
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on.
Speak to me what thou art.
She’s gone forever.
Thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam.
Who must hang them?
But yet, madam— I do not like “But yet.” It does allay The good precedence.
Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him.
The like is on her arm.
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all In this so sudden business.
Why, fare thee well, King.
It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men.
O braggart vile and damnèd furious wight, The grave doth gape, and doting death is near.
Are you my wife and will not call me “husband”?
Do you doubt that?
Will you know them then?
I am not what I am.
I know I cannot please you.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there Your single bond, and—in a merry sport— If you repay me not on such a day, In such a place, such sum or sums as are Expressed in the condition, let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me.
I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble.
Bruisèd pieces, go.
Riotous madness, To be entangled with those mouth-made vows Which break themselves in swearing!
Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
Our gracious brother, I will go with them.
You hear how he importunes me.
Give to a gracious message An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt.
His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
Well, look unto it.
Soldiers, have careful watch.
But tell me, is young George Stanley living?
What should that bode?
But sup them well and look unto them all.
Where is this sight?
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar To stop the foreign spirits, but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia.
If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented.
Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules, And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.
Welcome, my good Alexas.
What, is he dead?
Done to death by slanderous tongues Was the Hero that here lies.
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate To grace it with your sorrows.
What was thy cause?
Your man and you are marvelous merry, sir.
News have I that my Nell is dead i' th' spital Of a malady of France, And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
Why, then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe Caesar’s no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold.
And what of all this?
She Phoebes me.
And so am I for Rosalind.
Speak, I charge you.
Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
A most unhappy one.
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Have all his ventures failed?
Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to.
He is drowned Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land.
No jewel is like Rosalind.
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
All three Now marry in an instant.
What a blow was there given!
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land, A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
He shall stay my leisure.
Why, get you gone!
What, girl, though gray Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha’ we A brain that nourishes our nerves and can Get goal for goal of youth.
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love, And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits, Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.
Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance?
Shall we go see the relics of this town?
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.
You told me so.
We doubt not now But every rub is smoothèd on our way.
This day I breathed first.
Rebels it at these years?
Oh, noble weakness!
His words were, “Farewell, mistress.” Nothing else.
Show me, show me.
Nay, I have done.
Hath not else his eye Stray’d his affection in unlawful love, A sin prevailing much in youthful men Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?
But come, my lord, let’s away.
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!
A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate.
My mind hath been as big as one of yours, My heart as great, my reason haply more, To bandy word for word and frown for frown.
O Regan, Goneril, Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all— Oh, that way madness lies.
Art thou a man?
Oh, say so, and so be!
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
For even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio.
Methinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.
I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.
Verona, for a while I take my leave, To see my friends in Padua, but of all My best belovèd and approvèd friend, Hortensio.
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
First, know my horse is tired, my master and mistress fallen out.
What, not to pray?
What said my man, when my betossèd soul Did not attend him as we rode?
To me, sir?
Good morrow, sweet Hero.
You make me study of that.
Or blessè was ’t we did?
Madam, good hope.
Noses, ears, and lips.
Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.
Speak.
My lord.
Strike, drum.
I know he loves me well.
And most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath.
Why, I pray you, is not “pig” great?
Dost thou lie so low?
What, thou speak’st drowsily?
Oh, who hath done this deed?
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
Give me, give me!
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?
This falls out better than I could devise.
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
Have I the aspic in my lips?
She robs thee of thy name, And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone.
Oh, let me see thee walk!
I’ll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria.
Nay, I’ll help too.
Is ’t come to this?
In Caesar’s fleet Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought.
He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick.
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
I guess at it.
You look as you had something more to say.
Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out.
No, it is struck.
No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood could not do it.
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on, Behold her topped?
Will you pleasure me?
What, in our house?
Well, I’ll end the song.—Sirs, cover the while; the duke will drink under this tree.—He hath been all this day to look you.
Pardon, master.
Poor bird!
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.
I shall, King Harry.
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
Tis hatched, and shall be so.
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
Better thou Hadst not been born than not t' have pleased me better.
Our general’s wife is now the general.
And though you know my inwardness and love Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio, Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body.
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Is it not strange, Canidius, That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne?—You have heard on ’t, sweet?
I know I can do it.
No, unpin me here.
Take to you no hard thoughts.
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time.
Let the great gods That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads Find out their enemies now.
Peace, ho!
Now by my life, Old fools are babes again and must be used With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
God help the noble Claudio!
Call her forth, brother.
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter.
Has this fellow no feeling of his business?
We do not come as minding to contest you, Our true intent is.
Why, the honest men.
She’s dead as earth.
Oh, out of that “no hope” What great hope have you!
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
Into a thousand parts divide one man, And make imaginary puissance.
Very ill, too.
I have yet Room for six scotches more.
Then pleaded I for you.
Damned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Tis she must do ’t, And, lo, the happiness!
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, And I will break with her and with her father, And thou shalt have her.
I dare avouch it, sir.
Me believe it?
We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, “Here may you see the tyrant.”      I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet, And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life, And awful rule, and right supremacy, And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy?
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
And my help.
He cannot prevail with me.
No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, But doubt discovery there.
Come, night.
And I serve the fairy queen  To dew her orbs upon the green.
Here’s no knavery!
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
And, gentle master, I received no gold.
Shall I entreat a word?
Nay, you must call me Rosalind.—Come, sister, will you go? 
Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.
But I shall see The wingèd vengeance overtake such children.
It would become me As well as it does you, and I should do it With much more ease, for my good will is to it And yours it is against.
Why, whither shall we go?
She’s dead, deceased, she’s dead.
If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
Oh, villain that I am!
How smooth and even they do bear themselves, As if allegiance in their bosoms sat Crownèd with faith and constant loyalty.
Do not say so, Lysander.
Is that his answer?
Call you me daughter?
Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke.
How shall we try it?
Ho, open the door.
I tell thee, Kate, ’twas burnt and dried away.
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people, for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.
For love of God, forbear him.
Say what, is Horatio there?
Your servant Kent.
Let the world see His nobleness well acted, which your death Will never let come forth.
I did hear The galloping of horse.
Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance After your thoughts, straight back again to France.
Stand from the body.
Is it not like the king?
These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report—after fourteen years' purchase. 
Bid him levy straight The greatest strength and power that he can make And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
Cleopatra— Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of?
All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind.
Stay, countrymen.
Here is a place reserved, sir.
No boasting like a fool.
Who wrongs him?
I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding.
Where is he, in his bed?
Lepidus is high-colored.
In such a night To shut me out!
Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial.
We must not.
So haply are they friends to Antony.
Where is Malvolio?
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done.
Dost thou call me fool, boy?
I pray you, let it stand.
I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
Not so, neither.
I am hers.
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly.—Heaven and earth, Must I remember?
Two of them have the very bent of honor, And if their wisdoms be misled in this, The practice of it lives in John the Bastard, Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.
Consider then we come but in despite.
Out, fool.
There’s something else to do.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires, Men so disordered, so debauched and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn.
Not I.
Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair Where Brutus may but find it.
O, but one word.
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed too, ’tis a foul thing.
Celerity is never more admired Than by the negligent.
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
Doth it?
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away.
I am pale, Charmian.
Do you hear, Cassio?
Will you withdraw?
An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
You know that you are Brutus that speak this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
We will, my noble lord.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, While I with selfsame kindness welcome thine.
That eye that told you so looked but asquint.
Proceed, Moon.
If so, then be not tongue-tied.
I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband.
But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
And though she be but little, she is fierce.
Rescue, my lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling.
Have you writ down that they are none?
My Regan counsels well.
What means your grace?
And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me, Let it not enter in your mind of love.
Death is the fairest cover for her shame That may be wished for.
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
Cassio’s a proper man.
What, my lord?
Where I have come, great clerks have purposèd To greet me with premeditated welcomes, Where I have seen them shiver and look pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practiced accent in their fears, And in conclusion dumbly have broke off, Not paying me a welcome.
Parted you in good terms?
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
Your Majesty came not like yourself.
My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight.
Know’st thou the way to Dover?
Sir, do you know me?
What further woe conspires against mine age?
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.—Antony and Potpan!
Only I yield to die.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me.
Do so.
Never—O fault!—revealed myself unto him Until some half-hour past, when I was armed.
Beseech you, father.
Thy Fates open their hands.
If you deny it, let the danger light Upon your charter and your city’s freedom.
In voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person.
Ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling. 
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
What?
Ay.
I think the world’s asleep.
Oh, give us leave, great king, To view the field in safety and dispose Of their dead bodies.
There!
Appear and pertly!— No tongue.
But in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
If any ship put out, then straight away.
If not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.
Then will I lay the serving creature’s dagger on your pate.
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
What do you think?
If thou beest Stephano, touch me and speak to me.
O Antony, Antony, Antony!
Why seek’st thou me?
Prithee, listen well.
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.
No, I protest, I know not the contents.
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
What else, fellow?
And I have been all this day to avoid him.
Tom will throw his head at them.—Avaunt, you curs!
Patience, good sir.
Well roared, Lion!
Oh, look!
He is returned.
No, my good lord.
Will you come presently?
Alas now, pray you, Work not so hard.
Tranio, you jest.
Will you hoist sail, sir?
But, I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
Fine apparition!
I could marry this wench for this device.
So I will, my liege, as I live.
Give me up the truth.
Harder, harder.
I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine.
They were suborned.
When we our betters see bearing our woes, We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Pitiful sight!
I am much bound to you.
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself.
Pray you do not, sir.
For you know, nuncle, The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long, That it’s had it head bit off by it young.
Fight valiantly today.
This is the day wherein I wished to fall By the false faith of him who most I trusted.
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention —Brutus, what shall be done?
O, make them joyful.
No, my lord.
She haunts me in every place.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Be’st thou sad or merry, The violence of either thee becomes, So does it no man else.—Mett’st thou my posts?
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
Ophelia, walk you here.
I think not so, my lord.
Good dawning to thee, friend.
Go off, I discard you.
There may as well be amity and life 'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
Haply I see a friend will save my life And pay the sum that may deliver me.
If not, when you have stomachs.
Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me.
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true love take.
If any, speak—for him have I offended.
Thou speak’st with all thy wit; and yet, i' faith, With wit enough for thee.
Think you so?
Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand, in sad conference.
I must be circumstanced.
What, are you answered yet?
What doth she say, my lord of Buckingham?
Very well.
Make me to see ’t, or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!
This wretch hath part confessed his villainy.
Fairy King, attend, and mark.
And then the moon, like to a silver bow New bent in heaven, shall behold the night Of our solemnities.
What, mistress!
Stephano!
Say I will love her everlastingly.
How!
My lord, you once did love me.
I’ll make a sop o' th' moonshine of you.
He misses not much.
We have, sir.
Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.— There, Leonato, take her back again.
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
While grace is saying, hood mine eyes Thus with my hat, and sigh and say, “Amen”— Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam, never trust me more.
Full half an hour.
In love?
Get you to bed, faith.
You must awhile be patient.
Take thy forfeiture.
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
Despise me If I do not.
Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong For the whole world.
His countenance likes me not.
Have I not heard the sea, puffed up with winds, Rage like an angry boar chafèd with sweat?
But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismayed.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
Name him.
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
And cross-gartered?
God be with you.
Not I, my lord.
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
When Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire?
Holla!
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept.
God be wi' you and keep you and heal your pate.
This villain of mine comes under the prediction—there’s son against father.
No, madam, I do but read madness.
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?
Vile earth, to earth resign.
Here comes my man.
The duke’s to blame in this.
We will.
But now in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most, for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety.
For what, I pray thee?
Now, by yon marble heaven, In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words.
There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.
But I will write again to Mantua, And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures.
How now, my dear Othello?
Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their wits with their wives.
Thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
Our worser thoughts heavens mend.
Hence, Mardian, And bring me how he takes my death. 
If you did wed my sister for her wealth, Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness.
You have been hotly called for.
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes.
Where shall we dine?—O me!
This same is she, and I do give you her.
Without contradiction I have heard that.
Give you good morrow, sir.
Farewell, kind lord.
It is, my lord.
Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor, Joined with a masker and a reveler!
To her, my lord, Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
Pardon, sweet father.
Call my train together.— Degenerate bastard, I’ll not trouble thee.
Thou art a soldier only.
What’s the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler?
I made no such report.
Is ’t true?
Cleopatra, Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest.
Have at thee, coward!
Those his goodly eyes, That o’er the files and musters of the war Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front.
Dolabella, I shall remain your debtor.
Good my liege— Peace, Kent.
I am sorry for my cousin.
The fire seven times tried this, Seven times tried that judgment is, That did never choose amiss.
But yet I’ll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian.—Jessica, my girl, Look to my house.
Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night, That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Madam, if you could find out but a man To bear a poison, I would temper it, That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, Soon sleep in quiet.
Here, sir!
And so am I for no woman.
What malice was between you?
I will be flesh and blood, For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently, However they have writ the style of gods And made a push at chance and sufferance.
I will acquit you.
No, boy.
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.
Here comes Kent.
You have a daughter called Elizabeth, Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
Bring him, dead or living, Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory.
How now, masters?
Poor venomous fool Be angry and dispatch.
To the jail with him!
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less.
Tis his fashion.
Pray heaven it be State matters, as you think, and no conception Nor no jealous toy concerning you.
That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t.
A howling monster, a drunken monster.
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.
Not one to throw at a dog.
Thou shouldst be honest.
God bless you, sir.
Take thou some new infection to thy eye, And the rank poison of the old will die.
The time of universal peace is near.
Cousins, you know what you have to do.—O, I cry you mercy, friend.
He’s dead.
Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.
I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it.
They shall be married tomorrow, and I will bid the duke to the nuptial.
So, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnished me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom.
Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer!
Look, with a spot I damn him.
Do not go forth today.
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham, Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
Doubtful it stood, As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art.
Very well,” “go to”!
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair.
Tongue, not a word.
It is good to grow.
He left this ring behind him, Would I or not.
Oh, I am slain!—My lord, you have one eye left To see some mischief on him.
What noise is this?—Not dead?
How sound is she asleep!
Thou shalt be lord of it and I’ll serve thee.
Sir, fare you well.
Within our files there are, Of those that served Mark Antony but late, Enough to fetch him in.
Tell me, if your art Can tell so much: shall Banquo’s issue ever Reign in this kingdom?
Ah me!
He did bewray his practice, and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.
I think there’s never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he, For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman.
I speak no treason.
Farewell.
Sport?
They stay upon your patience.
Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole Till that the duke give order for his burial.
I’ll tell thee, friend, I am almost mad myself.
I do beseech you— Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers— What is your name?
I think not of them.
My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.
I have no exquisite reason for ’t, but I have reason good enough.
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in.
My will, not all the world.
Thou art a traitor— Off with his head.
Fool!
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man.
Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me.
As I descended?
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.
In bed asleep while they do dream things true.
I know not how to pray your patience, Yet I must speak.
And an ill singer, my lord.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
And take good note What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
We judge no less.—Uncle of Exeter, Enlarge the man committed yesterday That railed against our person.
Within this hour it will be dinnertime.
He was not merry, Which seemed to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy, but between both.
I pray you, keep it in.
You are a merry man, sir.
Well, my lord.
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity a while, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story.
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight.
Cheerly, good Adam. 
Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps.
I’ll plague him.
Amen.
You may as well do anything most hard, As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?— His Jewish heart.
There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all!
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
I know not that, when he knows what I know.
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.
I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is.
We’ll hear the will.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity, Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
Edmund, seek him out, wind me into him, I pray you.
Who are you?
My lord, you nod.
With robbers' hands my hospitable favors You should not ruffle thus.
For taking one’s part that’s out of favor.
All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.
Calls your Worship?
Fare thee well!
Well, God give them wisdom that have it.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
Yes, a dozen, and as many to th' vantage as would store the world they played for.
Good night.
Remember thee!
O, name him not.
What is this That rises like the issue of a king, And wears upon his baby-brow the round And top of sovereignty?

Ay.
Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself.
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarreling, drabbing—you may go so far.

Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.
Wilt thou, Strato?
No more perchance does mine, nor his, nor hers.
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance.
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges, Defective in their natures, grow to wildness, Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost, or do not learn for want of time, The sciences that should become our country, But grow like savages, as soldiers will
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.
There’s husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out.
If thou ask me why, sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty.
No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
Bless us!
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance.
What, are they children?
Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not.

Alas the day!
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Thou hast done a deed— I care not for thy sword, I’ll make thee known
Set it by a while.
O, wilt thou darkling leave me?
Nor go neither.
What do you mean?
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.
My dagger, little cousin?
What, a prisoner?
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn, To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
Go to, I’ll no more on ’t.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.
He was disposed to mirth, but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him.—Enobarbus!
Twill be naught, But let it be.
I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder. 
So would not I.

How now, old lad?
Where hast thou been, sister?
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her to look out at her lady’s chamber window.
You do advance your cunning more and more.
Fare thee well awhile.
Music i’ th’ air.
But I will punish home.
For mine own good, All causes shall give way.
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
If it be not for some purpose of import, Give ’t me again.
In happy time.
If they’ll do neither, we will come to them And make them skirr away as swift as stones Enforcèd from the old Assyrian slings.
I would you were as I would have you be!
They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam.
Thou'rt a scholar.
Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them.
Be gone!
Let them come before Master Constable.
And thy father Was Duke of Milan, and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued.
This, Decius Brutus.
He brings you figs.
Then love me, Rosalind.
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow  Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
He is a craven and a villain else, an ’t please your Majesty, in my conscience.
Alack, sir, he is mad.
That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.
Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love.
I’ll bring my wood home faster.
There be fools alive, iwis, Silvered o'er—and so was this.
I’ll torture him.
Return with her?
You must bear with me.
If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widow weeps.
Speak to me home.
Not so, not so.
Tis some mischance, the cry is very direful.
To horse, you gallant princes, straight to horse.
Why “with some little train,” my Lord of Buckingham?
Th' exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
That’s as we list to grace him.
It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Go to, woman, Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth From whence you have them.
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house.
Now I am alone.
Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
I said so, dear Katherine; and I must not blush to affirm it.
There will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known.
Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it.
Antony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but I do not greatly care to be deceived, That have no use for trusting.
Dost thou not suspect my years?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, Will furnish me.
Set we our squadrons on yond side o’ th’ hill, In eye of Caesar’s battle, from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly.
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her.
I will have nothing else but only this.
Adieu.
To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
Let it be so.
Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learned.
We have consented to all terms of reason.
If not, I’ll die your maid.
Behind the arras I’ll convey myself To hear the process.
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me.
A strange fish!
I hope now thou art not drowned.
Do not torment me, prithee.
Spit, fire!
I am sure of that.
Now Edmund, where’s the villain?
Softly, my masters.
Hoyday, a riddle!
He did comply, sir, with his dug before he sucked it.
My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
Ere I ope his letter, I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.
I prithee, hear me speak.
I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
My lord?
Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
She was too good for me.
For the meat, sir, it shall be covered.
With duty and desire we follow you.
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.
And yet no further than a wanton’s bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.
We will be married o' Sunday.
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.
By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Mark me.
Light, I say, light!
He says so, Tranio?
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear— Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
How?
The count himself here hard by woos her.
Tis time to look about.
Thou shalt, I warrant thee.
It may be, very like.
Why dost thou spit at me?
Here, Signior Tranio, This bird you aimed at, though you hit her not.— Therefore a health to all that shot and missed.
I tell you ’tis not very well.
Say that I slew them not.
Good night, good night!
The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it, for there is none to guard it but boys. 
Come from thy ward, For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop.
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?
So I hope.
He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies.
Nay, by 'r Lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think, if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you are in love or that you will be in love or that you can be in love.
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, Because they have been still my adversaries.
Well, go to, I will.
And, friends, disperse yourselves.
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool?
We must out and talk.
That’s all one: has hurt me, and there’s the end on ’t.
Or I, I promise thee.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damnèd Dane, Drink off this potion.
Beyond imagination is the wrong That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
Here lay Duncan, His silver skin laced with his golden blood, And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance; there, the murderers, Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore.
Let go, slave, or thou diest!
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa— What, what, what?
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor.
So please your Lordship to accept our duty.
Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances.
I warrant you, sir, The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardor of my liver.
Before me, she’s a good wench.
A worthy fool!
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me.
Call the slave again.
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
I shifted him away And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre.
Cleopatra, Do not abuse my master’s bounty by Th’ undoing of yourself.
Good.
I shall be reconciled to him again.
He dies that strikes again.
And you by land.
Let me alone.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
I mean, my head upon your lap?
From the Count Orsino, is it?
I am bound to hear.
How now?
Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make ’s love known?
A miracle!
Why dost thou stay?
We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.
Stop in your wind, sir.
As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it.
Go, Lovell, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
Self-harming jealousy, fie, beat it hence.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
As strange as the thing I know not.
Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool.
You should be ruled and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself.
Here comes your father.
Oh, most lame and impotent conclusion!
Happy be Theseus, our renownèd duke.
It pleases your Worship to say so, but we are the poor duke’s officers.
Prithee bear some charity to my wit.
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife’s point and choke a daw withal.
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester.
A dry jest, sir.
I can no more.
Do ’t, knight.
Behold the ordnance on their carriages, With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there.
Fire!
Fare you well.
Tis now near night.
You know I gave it you half an hour since.
I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady.
Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop?
You shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
You must not look so sour.
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
Can virtue hide itself?
Oh, monstrous!
Phoebe did write it.
Oh, the good gods!
I may command where I adore.” Why, she may command me.
Sweet Portia, If you did know to whom I gave the ring, If you did know for whom I gave the ring, And would conceive for what I gave the ring, And how unwillingly I left the ring When naught would be accepted but the ring, You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
They have not been commanded, mighty king.
What a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company?
Why dost thou use me thus?
Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony, But Antony’s hath triumphed on itself.
O vassal!
I will hear further reason for this.
As I am Egypt’s queen, Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine Is Caesar’s homager.
Miserable England, I prophesy the fearfull’st time to thee That ever wretched age hath looked upon.— Come, lead me to the block.
Were they not forced with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home.
At a word, I am not.
Do not, my lord.
Fare you well.
From Silvius, sir.
Why, the end is he hath lost a ship.
And Cassio killed!
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
The things that threatened me Ne'er looked but on my back.
Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.
Well.
See, Caesar!
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
And are not you my husband?
O heavy day!
That’s my noble master!
For, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
No man must know.” If this should be thee, Malvolio?
I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted, He lessens his requests, and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens.
Armed, my lord.
We must follow the leaders.
A pack of blessings light upon thy back, Happiness courts thee in her best array,
What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then, with public accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancor—O God, that I were a man!
This is called “the countercheck quarrelsome,” and so to “the lie circumstantial” and “the lie direct.”  And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
Upon my sword.
Pour in sow’s blood, that hath eaten Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten From the murderer’s gibbet throw Into the flame.
Let me have audience for a word or two.
Yes, sir, I have indeed.
By computation and mine host’s report, I could not speak with Dromio since at first I sent him from the mart.
She confesses it.
And so, I pray thee, call Beatrice.
Alas, then she is drowned.
He were no lion were not Romans hinds.
That’s my sister.
I have said.
Marry, God defend his grace should say us nay!
Tis not in the bond.
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she, And “Tailor!” cries, and falls into a cough, And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there.
What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
What should he be?
And I the king shall love thee.
If you have any music that may not be heard, to ’t again.
Silence awhile.—Robin, take off this head.— Titania, music call, and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
Win me and wear me!
Nay then, I’ll run.
And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife!
A king, perhaps— My lord— How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
O my son, my son!
Well, I would you did like me.
We’ll no more meet, no more see one another.
Too old to be engaged to young.
Well struck!
Draw thy sword and give me Sufficing strokes for death.
Therefore be double damned, Swear thou art honest!
Tell me what more thou know’st.
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
O mischief strangely thwarting!
Who is here so base that would be a bondman?
My life upon her faith!—Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee.
A gentle riddance.—Draw the curtains, go.— Let all of his complexion choose me so.
Let’s not consort with them.
Nothing, my lord, or if—I know not what.
The drink, the drink!
Portia, adieu.
I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil.
And have you mercy too!
Go, by this token.
Of Mantua.
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.
And there the snake throws her enameled skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
Give me mine angle.
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.
Stand, an you be a man.
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
Tis more, ’tis more.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
Though his bark cannot be lost, Yet it shall be tempest-tossed.
Oh, but she is wise.
Therefore with frank and with uncurbèd plainness Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.
A parlous boy!
All that is spoke is marred.
Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again.
Go fetch them hither.
Where is the number of our English dead?
Look, here comes a walking fire.
Is ’t gone?
Rise, and lend thine ear.
My learnèd lord, we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salic that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim.
All thy other titles thou hast given away that thou wast born with.
All this is comfort.
By my holy order, I thought thy disposition better tempered.
O Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe!
Hark!
That light we see is burning in my hall.
Lucius!
Peace, Smulkin.
I will give him some relief if it be but for that.
I thank you.
I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then he’s full of matter.
I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.
His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor, for the goose carries not the fox.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple.
Dost thou mean the crown?
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads.
One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.
I must go with you to Belmont.
The hearts of old gave hands, But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
Spakest thou of Juliet?
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
There’s ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he’s an arrant knave.
For God’s sake, a pot of small ale.
And for I know she taketh most delight In music, instruments, and poetry, Schoolmasters will I keep within my house, Fit to instruct her youth.
Kill!
Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite.
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night Pursue her.
Lorenzo certain, and my love indeed— For who love I so much?
On him I lay what you would lay on me, The right and fortune of his happy stars, Which God defend that I should wring from him.
But I will tell you at some meeter season.
Tis now struck twelve.
And a good soldier too, lady.
We’ll give them present audience.
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
My noble girls!
But are they, Ariel, safe?
Nothing will come of nothing.
It hath made me mad.
Pluck up thy spirits.
Tis not the first time you were overshot.
How is the man esteemed here in the city?
E'en so.
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.
If you will live, lament.
Let this be so.
With the earl, sir, here within.
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count?
Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed Mine innocent child?
My news I might have told hereafter.
What news?
And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow.
O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
Crack thy frail case!—Apace, Eros, apace.
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honor both.
Where be thy brothers?
Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms and everything beside.
They told me I was everything.
Do, do.
These things, come thus to light, Smother her spirits up.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
So young, my lord, and true.
I’ll strike and cry, “Take all.”                                                           Well said.
Awake!
That very time I saw (but thou couldst not) Flying between the cold moon and the Earth, Cupid all armed.
Ha!
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?
Brutus hath rived my heart.
Away!
Why then, you are in love.
Rarely, rarely.
My heart is sorry for your daughter’s death, But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing But what was true and very full of proof.
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly.
How think you of it?
Speak!
Is it so, countrymen?
Is it within reason and compass?
That ever I should call thee castaway!
Madam, I’ll take my leave.
At your request!
O, tell me, Friar, tell me, In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge?
How long hath this possession held the man?
I am a tainted wether of the flock, Meetest for death.
Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.
And am I then revenged
As woman’s love.
Twere damnation To think so base a thought.
I will hold friends with you, lady.
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard’s Castle, Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well-learnèd bishops.
Let our catch be “Thou Knave.” “Hold thy peace, thou knave,” knight?
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.
And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
And leave out thee?
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?
Here comes the good Macduff.
Indeed she’s a most fresh and delicate creature.
I shall do well.
We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it.—Who goes there?
What features?
What thou wouldst highly, That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, And yet wouldst wrongly win.
Thou liest.
Disorder, that hath spoiled us, friend us now.
Of the king’s ship, The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, And all the rest o' th' fleet.
This contents.
Drunk?
She shall be buried by her Antony.
Mark, I say, instantly, and carry it so As I have set it down.
Why then, ’tis good to be a post.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, This tun of treasure, and, in lieu of this, Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you.
Trust me, I could do much— Prithee, no more.
Like aqua vitae with a midwife.
Oh, there has been much throwing about of brains.
I’ll do ’t, my lord.
I beseech thee, youth, Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury.
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, In such disdainful manner me to woo.
mutinies, in countries discord, in palaces treason, and the bond cracked ’twixt son and father.
He did appoint so.
She that makes dainty, She, I’ll swear, hath corns.
Demetrius loves your fair.
Caesar sits down in Alexandria, where I will oppose his fate.
By day and night he wrongs me.
That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away.
O, then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!
What’s the disease he means?
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes.
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.—   O murderous coxcomb!
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
My lord, I do protest—    O, do not swear!
So Fulvia told me.
Saw you the weird sisters?
We’ll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimmed up for Semiramis.
Their great guilt, Like poison given to work a great time after, Now 'gins to bite the spirits.
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
Tis a hooded valor, and when it appears, it will bate.
I understand not what you mean by this.
This wedding day Perhaps is but prolonged.
My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in.
With all my heart.—Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place.— Meantime the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.
Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.
There’s a division betwixt the dukes.
Good duke, receive thy daughter.
Thou teachest me.
I will be treble-sinewed, -hearted, -breathed, And fight maliciously.
Pray you, sir, stand up.
Why, would that have mended my hair?
Bless thee, Bottom, bless thee.
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage.
Honest, ay, honest.
Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full as fortunate a bed As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
Speak you so gently?
Barnardo?
If I could make that resemble something in me—Softly!
Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother.—Tom Snout, the tinker?
Hero itself can blot out Hero’s virtue.
If he distaste it, let him to our sister, Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, Not to be overruled.
To the mines?
No.
Will you be patient?
Why in that rawness left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking?
The competitors enter.
I forgive you the praise.
What’s your highness’ pleasure?
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail.
Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio’s not alive.
I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one.
What are you there?
God keep you from them, and from such false friends.
Ay, ay.
You shall hear more.
Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand?
Methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh 
They follow the king’s pleasure.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
I do require them of you, so to use them As we shall find their merits and our safety May equally determine.
Thy currish spirit Governed a wolf who, hanged for human slaughter, Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infused itself in thee, for thy desires Are wolvish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has, Or needs not us.
You understand me?
I do.
I have performed Your pleasure and my promise.
In this time of the night?
Money by me!
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs, Gives her fame which never dies.
I would not change this hue Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
But he hath chid me hence and threatened me To strike me, spurn me—nay, to kill me too.
Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
Let it go.
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities.
Adieu.
No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sighed upon a midnight pillow.
Then is courtesy a turncoat.
O Iras, Charmian!
Your children shall be kings.
Didst perceive?
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
Why, how now, monsieur?
Worse and worse.
Here I stand, your slave— A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
They would not have you to stir forth today.
O conspiracy, Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free?
I will talk further with you.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have showed some truth.
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,  And follows but for form,  Will pack when it begins to rain  And leave thee in the storm.
No, my dearest love, I would not for the world.
For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them.—I have done, my lord.
Patience unmoved!
Alas, that they are so, To die even when they to perfection grow!
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly followed.
Is ’t come to this?
We have been up and down to seek him.
Conrade, I say!
Now, Eros.
Tis past, and so am I.
Lay forth the gown.
I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
Too well what love women to men may owe.
Here.
Set it down.
Look behind you, my lord.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
No more of that.
Anon!
But I can tell why a snail has a house.
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; Your Honor hath no shriving work in hand.
We must to the watch.
The thoughts of people.
Sir, sir, that cannot be.
Worthy gentleman!
Madam, what should I do?
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfilled, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
And so will I.
The day is broke.
Despised, distressèd, hated, martyred, killed!
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.
Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmeared As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.
Ah, that good Kent— He said it would be thus, poor banished man.
O, fie, fie, fie!
Give me your hand.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close, His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage, The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom, And Anne my wife hath bid this world goodnight.
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, Past speaking of in a king.
Look to the queen there, ho!
Go with me, Silvius.
Prithee, go in thyself.
This will put them out of fear.
Come hither, Fabian.
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
His eyes were green as leeks.
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
By Jacob’s staff, I swear, I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.
So may you lose your arms.
Fear’st thou that, Antonio?
Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne'er look you i' th' face again.
What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
Well this was Signor Benedick that said so.
Knock, I say.
Art thou a churchman?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
Under a compelling occasion, let women die.
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
This speed of Caesar’s Carries beyond belief.
Thus high, by thy advice And thy assistance is King Richard seated.
What’s the matter?
What noise is that?
Oh, heaven forgive me!
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
Twas the boy that stole your meat, and you’ll beat the post.
I will not stay to offend you.
Be not offended.
Welcome, Publius.
Iago?
Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted.
Before the eyes of both our armies here, Which should perceive nothing but love from us, Let us not wrangle.
Ah, where’s my man?—Give me some aqua vitae.— These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian.
I was, but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode.
Is thy name William?
What country, friends, is this?
Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give To sounds confused.
I am come To bid my king and master aye good night.
Wash they his wounds with tears?
By such despair I should accuse myself.
Give me some music.
Welcome, wanderer.
How canst thou thus for shame, Titania, Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
Our purposes God justly hath discovered, And I repent my fault more than my death, Which I beseech Your Highness to forgive, Although my body pay the price of it.
Why, how now, daughter Katherine?
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Sirs, let ’t alone.
O happy dagger, This is thy sheath.
With Demetrius.
The bloody proclamation to escape, That followed me so near—O our lives' sweetness,
And I remember the kissing of her batler, and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked.
See, here he comes.
But well.
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet.
I must be idle.
Thou know’st where I will tarry.
How have you slept, my lord?
If you’ll sit down, I’ll bear your logs the while.
How now?
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.
We will not fail.
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife’s allies And make me happy in your unity.
He may win, And what is music then?
I’ll fight at sea.
An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I’ll be hanged. 
you know me well.
Our brother is imprisoned by your means, Myself disgraced, and the nobility Held in contempt, while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
So was I when your Highness banished him.
He’s no standard.
The Emperor calls Canidius.
Give me your hand.
Urchins Shall, forth at vast of night that they may work, All exercise on thee.
Master, knock the door hard.
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.
Ha!
What treasure, uncle?
I may not, madam.
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Speak, Count, ’tis your cue.
It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.
Yes, I have gained my experience.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.
A friend of Antony’s.
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come That I should wish for thee to help me curse That bottled spider, that foul bunch-backed toad!
Having once this juice, I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
Do you not hear me speak?
But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward.
Go thy ways, wench.
Madam, I will.
And here stands all your state: Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the break of day disguised from hence.
Besides, the king’s name is a tower of strength Which they upon the adverse party want.
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear, And then we will deliver you the cause, Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded.
There’s none but witches do inhabit here, And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence.
Cast thy humble slough,” says she.
I say I love thee more than he can do.
Say not so.
It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
O most bloody sight!
Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
O day untowardly turned!
But I am constant as the northern star, Of whose true-fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament.
Up to the breach, you dogs!
I would I had been there.
You all do know this mantle.
Come, my lord, and in our flight Tell me how it came this night That I sleeping here was found With these mortals on the ground.
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The armed rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble.
Tis not a time for private stomaching.
Do so.
What are you?
Let her send it.
More, more, I prithee, more.
Did you see Master Lorenzo?
Here’s sport indeed!
Refuse it not.
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.
Sir, a word ere you go.
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.
I have been to seek you.
I crave your highness’ pardon.
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
Why will My lord do so?
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties, or, if love be blind, It best agrees with night.
He never did harm that I heard of.
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans, Mistlike, infold me from the search of eyes.
His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.
Speak.
Well, we were born to die.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not.
What is it she does now?
Iago.
Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love, What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
No, sir, the worse.
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.
Oh, she was foul!— I scarce did know you, uncle.
We came crying hither.
But I’ll catch thine eyes, Though they had wings.
What’s that, I pray?
Do we so.
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on.
Tis neither here nor there.
Now he is a-praying.
Away, make haste.
Ay, boy, ready.
And, good boy, good night.
I say, there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.
Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy.
And then?
Hark, what noise is this?
How now?
I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.
I do not think it good.
His name!
For you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
By providence divine.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek.
Shylock, do you hear?
And tell the Dauphin His jest will savor but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
To what effect?
Some good I mean to do Despite of mine own nature.
Let it be written in eight and eight.
Yearly will I do this rite.
Know you him?
Away with it!
I wot well where he is.
Othello?
Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
Alack, alack!
Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th' arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. 
Alas!
No, by my life and soul!
Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong—for with her death That tidings came—with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire.
How now, Roderigo!
The fellow has good judgment.
Where’s Romeo?
And ere I take this charm from of her sight— As I can take it with another herb— I’ll make her render up her page to me.
Till then, think of the world.
I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home, Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, Let us be worried, and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy.
A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly.
A tailor make a man?
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
Let me be clear of thee.
Approach, Sir Andrew.
I told him you were asleep.
There comes an old man and his three sons— I could match this beginning with an old tale.
O my good master!
Is ’t long or round?
News, old news, and such news as you never heard of!
They would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor.
Who talks of my nation?
I know you are no truant.
Yes, I intend so.
Our dinner done and he not coming thither, I went to seek him.
I’ll set her on.
Oh, she is Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed, And he’s composed of harshness.
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart.
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.
I’ll be at thy elbow.
Tucket Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry, If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound, Before thy most assurèd overthrow.
It doth not fit me.
A poor unfortunate beggar.
Pray thee, take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior I be misconst’red in the place I go to, And lose my hopes.
Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit?
Indeed!
You are resolute, then?
Where America, the Indies?
We first address towards you, who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter.
Heaven doth truly know it.
Adieu, good Monsieur Melancholy.
But oh, how vile an idol proves this god!
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort, Like to the senators of th' antique Rome, With the plebeians swarming at their heels, Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in— As, by a lower but loving likelihood,
Ay, ay.
Then none have I offended.
But notwithstanding, haste.
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
But jealous souls will not be answered so.
E'en at hand, alighted by this.
Past all expressing.
Tis he.
Do you like me, Kate?
I have heard more since.
My lord.
Therefore thou liest.
Who is here so vile that will not love his country?
It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
Oh, excellent!
Is that any thing now?
Pluck them asunder.
Indeed, he is so.
To what end, my lord?
My prayers, minx?
Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the watery glass, Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass (A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal), Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home.
Come, I will have thee, but, by this light, I take thee for pity.
Fie!
Her father’s brother Would be her lord?
No, it is Casca, one incorporate To our attempts.
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.
Belike some noble gentleman that means, Traveling some journey, to repose him here.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world, too saucy with the gods, Incenses them to send destruction.
It follows, then, the cat must stay at home.
She is damned for it.
Fetch Desdemona hither.
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours.
I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
That “sort” was well fished for.
Sit down and rest.
If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no.
I pray thee, give it me.
My father’s spirit in arms.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword, Which if thou please to hide in this true breast And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, I lay it naked to the deadly stroke And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
Ay, madam.
I must obey.
I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
She was, good Curtis, before this frost.
By your leave, hostess.
It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is not in the contents.
Wake her not.
You know my mind.
Go call him hither.
First let us go to dinner.
My master stays in the street.
For your father’s remembrance, be at accord.
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, That which so often you did bid me steal.
I beseech you.
Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night.
And this.
Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many of your nation—  Of my nation?
Many times, madam.
You keep by land The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
Well, Jessica, go in.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God I pray, That I may live to say, “The dog is dead.”
Is not marriage honorable in a beggar?
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears Belong to Egypt.
And indeed it takes From our achievements, though performed at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute.
At least I’m sure it may be so in Denmark.
Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn And give it food.
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels.
The duke be here tonight?
Tis so—but Edward lives.
So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft Quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon, And the imperial votaress passèd on, In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
It shall do well.
He does well to commend it himself.
Are you of good or evil?
Speak the word along.
Oh, then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us Is as our earing.
Farewell.
You’ll heat my blood.
Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done, And I am pressed unto it.
These words are not mine.
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth.
Did you ever cure any so?
But I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him.
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace.
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
What news from her?
I must eat my dinner.
Myself have to mine own turned enemy.
The fiend gives the more friendly counsel.
I do love it better than laughing.
As from a bear a man would run for life, So fly I from her that would be my wife.
Why, that’s spoken like an honest drover; so they sell bullocks.
A most poor man made tame to fortune’s blows, Who by the art of known and feeling sorrows Am pregnant to good pity.
That he hath not.
Come, Let’s have one other gaudy night.
Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us.
Here’s the manner of ’t: I’ th’ marketplace, on a tribunal silvered, Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthroned.
Sir, I have not you by the hand.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
What would my lord?
O my son, what theme?
Fare thee well.
Shall they see us?
Conception is a blessing, but, as your daughter may conceive—Friend, look to ’t.
Be quiet, people.
Tell me your counsels.
Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner, For which, I hope, thou felt’st I was displeased.
I look down towards his feet, but that’s a fable.
You spoke not with her since?
Let me entreat you.
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered, Ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age; The parents live whose children thou hast butchered, Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
Sure ones, then.
We are for you.
Bear’st thou her face in mind?
My young master doth expect your reproach.
Tis a strange serpent.
He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts. 
And so she doth, cousin.
This house is little.
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
But now, my lord.
In, or we are spoiled.
But we are prevented.
Take your place.
The higher Nilus swells The more it promises.
He may recover yet. 
Farewell.
Be merciful, say “death,” For exile hath more terror in his look, Much more than death.
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.
And so swear I.
What is the matter, ho?
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
But indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.
The hour steals on.
I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die.
What’s this?
I’ll able 'em.
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied With Romeo, till I behold him—dead— Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed.
And, you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
Nay, but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That, with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him.
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favors?
This is kind I offer.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest— For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men— Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
Bring us the letter.
I am a villain.
Follow, and see there be no harm between them.
Tis not needed yet.
Alas, the storm is come again!
Why, in good time.  
I like it not.
I care not for good life.              
Come on.
My salad days, When I was green in judgment, cold in blood, To say as I said then.
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
But of that tomorrow, When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly.
Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
Things must be as they may.
But, sir, be you ruled by me.
The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three. 
Come, some music!
Nay, good Lysander.
Faith, we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.
A very mean meaning.
He calls me “boy” and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt.
I will not sup tonight.
But how, but how?
And come you now with “knocking at the gate”?
It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands.
Who’s there?
Then certifies your Lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razèd his helm Besides, he says there are two councils kept, And that may be determined at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
That you should here repent you, The actors are at hand, and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know.
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, And much different from the man he was.
I thank thee, master.
I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways.
Hear me, good brother— Under your pardon.
Then heaven Have mercy on me!
Can Fulvia die?
Let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will manifest.
If thou beest as poor for a subject as he’s for a king, thou'rt poor enough.
There my Lysander and myself shall meet.
For, of my heart, those charms, thine eyes, are blotted.
Peace, sirrah!
I had rather be a country servant-maid Than a great queen with this condition, To be so baited, scorned, and stormèd at.
Caesar, all hail!
But why should honor outlive honesty?
More, I prithee, more.
By two o'clock I will be with thee again.
Here, kiss the book.
Lord, how art thou changed!
What is the matter, lady?
Why, bride!
It is even so.
Well, sir, we will not.
This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life.
What a night’s this!
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view.
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles, And lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
Ay, Lepidus.
Neither can be enjoyed If both remain alive.
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Our good old friend, Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow Your needful counsel to our business, Which craves the instant use.
I’ll mend it and then play— Where’s the Queen?
Spare not for the cost.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
Let them go.
Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus.
We cannot be here and there too.
Where do I dwell?
Sweet-heart!
Hold, sir, for God’s sake!
Why prat’st thou to thyself and answer’st not?
Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but foul breath, and foul breath is noisome.
Judge me, you gods!
Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.
Yet his means are in supposition.
So shall I, love, And so, I pray, be you.
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points?
Let’s then determine with the ancient of war On our proceedings.
Who ambles time withal?
Down with him, thief!
No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly.
Had he his hurts before?
He hath been a courtier, he swears.
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight, Give it an understanding, but no tongue.
Heaven make thee free of it.
And doth affection breed it?
Till which encounter It is my business too.
Let’s away And get our jewels and our wealth together, Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight.
Enough, I am engaged.
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story That I may prompt them; and of such as have, I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse Of time, of numbers, and due course of things, Which cannot in their huge and proper life Be here presented.
If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.
Here comes the noble Antony.
There’s some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
God for Thy mercy, they are loose again!
A noble prisoner!
Ay, he.
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?
Come, Menas.
So you may put a man in your belly.
What does he say of Brutus?
Your overkindness doth wring tears from me.
Stand not amazed.
Who’s there?
Is not this true?
Go, leave me.
Nothing, but this is so.
In a false quarrel there is no true valor.
Oh, I have read it.
Even so.
What news abroad?
Go we to him.
This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeit of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting-on.
We wish your peace.
Oh, then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!
I hope she will be brief.
I humbly thank you for’t.
That will I, for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
But good lieutenant, is your general wived?
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.
Some achieve greatness—” What sayest thou?
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in ’s own house.
Dost thou mock me?
Is ’t not your trick?
Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
Let your epilogue alone.
One way I like this well.
By your patience, I needs must rest me.
Here comes one o' the parings.
And yet it is not: it is but so-so.
No, my good lord.
Let her not walk i' th' sun.
O Bottom, thou art changed!
My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time Goes upright with his carriage.
Twas no need, I trow, To bid me trudge.
The fault of it I’ll answer.
Why not, my lord?
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
And cries aloud, “Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.
Serve God.
Why, Antony.
He hath assembled Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus, Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont; Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King Of Comagen; Polemon and Amyntas, The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia, With a more larger list of scepters.
Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard.
Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats: Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance.
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
Whither, my lord?—Cesario, husband, stay.
Hath there been such a time—I would fain know that— That I have positively said, “'Tis so,” When it proved otherwise?
No words.
O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth, The true succeeders of each royal house, By God’s fair ordinance conjoin together, And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
To Baptista Minola.
Why, then, I care not for thee.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
Is he not able to discharge the money?
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry.
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
Have I, Malvolio?
Alas, poor caitiff!
Tis well thou art not fish.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous.
Fear it, Ophelia.
Harpier cries, “'Tis time, ’tis time.” Round about the cauldron go, In the poisoned entrails throw.
how am I beset!— What kind of catechizing call you this?
With Cassio, mistress.
Is not this true?
Not too fast!
Thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable Where Caesar’s is not.
Alas, he is betrayed and I undone.
God made him and therefore let him pass for a man.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so.
Dolabella!
Oh, that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.
O Tranio, till I found it to be true, I never thought it possible or likely.
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover, Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank, Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs, Losing both beauty and utility.
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper, And other of such vinegar aspect That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone.
Happy is your Grace, That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
Ratcliffe, about the mid of night come to my tent And help to arm me.
What, you look merrily.
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
No.
It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.
Good faith, a little one, not past a pint, As I am a soldier.
There’s the respect That makes calamity of so long life.
Old I do wax, and from my weary limbs Honor is cudgeled.
Go by, Saint Jeronimy.
Tybalt’s death Was woe enough, if it had ended there.
I’ll go and chat with Paris.
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
This lion is a very fox, for his valor.
No?
How’s that?
Tomorrow We’ll hear ourselves again.
Have you not set mine honor at the stake, And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think?
I am glad to see your Honor.
In nothing am I changed But in my garments.
For God’s sake, hold your hands.
I’ll wait upon your Lordship.
Are you full of them?
Not a mouse stirring.
Leave you your power to draw, And I shall have no power to follow you.
How then, sick?
I am sure I am none such.
What do you see?
Thou bleed’st apace.
Do not you love me?
If she and I be pleased, what’s that to you?
O my lord, my lord, Forgive my fearful sails!
And so did I.
Done.
Hear his speech but say thou nought.
Friar!
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
Unbutton here.
I marry her!
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Return to her, and fifty men dismissed?
I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
I shall, my lord.
Let him fly far.
In my mind’s eye, Horatio.
Tweaks me by the nose?
More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.
Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into sedges.
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
Why, Fool?
But, soft!
Come hither, come!
But since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose My patience to his fury, and am armed To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his.
Avoid, and leave him.
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.

I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful!
Hark!
Right, as snow in harvest.
His flight was madness.
Welcome, good Cambio.
I do not well know, my lord.
Ready.
Or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Where is he now?
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood, Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
Never at quiet.
God 'ild you, sir.
Faith, like enough.
I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.
Sir, have pity, I’ll be his surety.
Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me.
I prithee, be gone.                          
Trust not to rotten planks.
Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o' th' earth When it is baked with frost.
I say “thy husband”—dost understand the word?
I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Let’s make us med'cines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief.
The April’s in her eyes; it is love’s spring, And these the showers to bring it on.
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
And this, Metellus Cimber.
She well instructs me.
But, in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
Ay, there it is.
Well then, confess and live.
Why, thou sayst well.
A fig!
Hence!
On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colored fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did.
For what is he they follow?
It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk.
Fiery”?
But come, your Bergomask.
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-backed toad.
My banquet is to close our stomachs up, After our great good cheer.
I am sure you both of you remember me.
How now, spirit?
On the ground  Sleep sound.
A drum, a drum!
Here it is, I think.
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
That were the most if he should   husband you.
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
Come, go in.
Come, let’s do so.
It was in place where I could not breed no contention with him, but I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again, and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.
To the tuition of God.
I am no fee’d post, lady.
Some tender money to me; some invite me; Some other give me thanks for kindnesses; Some offer me commodities to buy.
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king, Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As is our wretches fettered in our prisons.
He has no children.
And therefore haste away, For we must measure twenty miles today.
Why?
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers.
Be the Jacks fair within, the Jills fair without, the carpets laid, and everything in order?
In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned tonight, for she shall not live.
This night methinks is but the daylight sick.
That’s two of his weapons.
Go and tell them so.
Away!
I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts.
I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s.
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
All’s but naught.
So God sa' me, ’tis shame to stand still.
Good morrow to you both.
Under Captain Gower, my liege.
When have I injured thee?
Pray, what do you think is his name?
The Queen, my lord, the Queen.
I will kiss thy lips.
O Cassius, Far from this country Pindarus shall run, Where never Roman shall take note of him.
And you shall be satisfied.
Not today, O Lord, Oh, not today, think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown.
I know his gait, ’tis he.—Villain, thou diest!
Hear you, sir?
But it sufficeth that the day will end, And then the end is known.—Come, ho!
The “fiery” duke?
She shall not.
It is a massy wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin.
Farewell.
Go to, away.
You’ll win two days upon me.
Look to ’t.
Arise, and say how thou camest here.
Tis in my memory locked, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Hark.
I must be one of these same dumb wise men, For Gratiano never lets me speak.
I do but keep the peace.
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Here, catch this casket.
Come now, keep thine oath.
Some say the lark makes sweet division.
And now about the cauldron sing, Like elves and fairies in a ring, Enchanting all that you put in.
Ish a villain and a basterd and a knave and a rascal.
If I think so, I think the same of you.
We have engaged ourselves too far.
Call forth my household servants.
Who hath sent thee now?
And I must Rid all the sea of pirates, then, to send Measures of wheat to Rome.
I know my hour is come.
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face, And doth it give me such a sight as this?
What a pied ninny’s this!—Thou scurvy patch!— I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows And take his bottle from him.
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin, For to deny each article with oath Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal.
Be ruled by me.
Thy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.
I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.
If you choose that wherein I am contained, Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized.
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
The British powers are marching hitherward.
Good morrow, General.
I will be hanged, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devised this slander.
I did, my lord.
What trumpet’s that?
I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
Oh, farewell!
Hie, make haste, Make haste.
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies.
Nay, go not back.
I was the man i' the moon when time was.
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball.
Why, sweet Othello—   I have not deserved this.
Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well.
We will ourselves provide.
He’s not thy kinsman.
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
I humbly take my leave.
Fly, masters!
All’s hushed as midnight yet.
I cannot tell wat is dat.
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse Is all of her.
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son’s distemper.
It is no boast, being asked, to say we are.
I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses.
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
When Roscius was an actor in Rome—  The actors are come hither, my lord.
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams.
My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
An honest man he is, and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds.
All’s one.
Come, Grey.
You say not right, old man.
The capon burns; the pig falls from the spit; The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; My mistress made it one upon my cheek.
I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care.
But be thou armed for some unhappy words.
O, give me leave.
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave My heart into my mouth.
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
I’ll not be far from you.
My most dear Gloucester!
And then he offered it the third time.
A Cornish name.
Speed him hence.
Tarry, Jew.
Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
By my fay, a goodly nap.
Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further.
So to most noble Caesar.
Yea, my good lord.
Behold, I have a weapon.
Ay, more.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
Here, sir!” You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms!
Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope And told thee to what purpose and what end.
O ye immortal gods!
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
Who is it?
These things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia.
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once.
I will stop your mouth.
Hark!
Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent— Look back!
There lies your way, due west.
He is enamored on Hero.
Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
I' th' clout, i' th' clout.
Our troops set forth tomorrow.
Doth not my wit become me rarely?
Chopped logic!
You are welcome.
Sister, you know he promised me a chain.
If I owe you anything, I will pay you in cudgels.
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir.
Nay, not sound, I pray you.
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid, Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen’s torch be lighted—but in vain.
I can see a church by daylight.
What raiment will your Honor wear today?
One would think his mother’s milk were scarce out of him.
Where will the old duke live?
Why, that was he.
Speak, Agrippa.
Let him come, and kindly.
Wherefore throng you hither?
The interim’s mine.
That shall you know hereafter.
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she, as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king.
Another hit.
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror, For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
It is not well done, mark you now, to take the tales out of my mouth ere it is made and finished.
Oh, curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites!
He was a man.
How old art thou?
You hear him all night.
At last I left them I' th' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, There dancing up to th' chins, that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet.
Prove true, imagination, oh, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
I’ll to England.
Know you any, Hero?
Off, pluck off!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Is not that strange?
Why, this is not a boon, 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person.
Anon we’ll drink a measure The table round.
What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats To have it baned?
You have done that you should be sorry for.
Smatter with your gossips, go.
I warrant you, my lord.
Here he is, here he is.
Be it so, Lysander.
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate.
And thou, all-shaking thunder, Smite flat the thick rotundity o' th' world, Crack nature’s molds, all germens spill at once That make ingrateful man!
Marvelous sweet music!
And your reports have set the murder on.
In your dumps?
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, That covenants may be kept on either hand.
Intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio, as in love of your brother’s honor, who hath made this match, and his friend’s reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid, that you have discovered thus.
Four nights will quickly dream away the time.
And, as I am an honest Puck,  If we have unearnèd luck  Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,  We will make amends ere long.
But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers, With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Go with me to the duchess.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Pompey is strong at sea, And it appears he is beloved of those That only have feared Caesar.
She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested.
Madam, do you.
How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
I' faith, coz, ’tis he.
The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams That ever entered in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had, my lords.
O horror, horror, horror!
You may think I love you not.
What shall we hear of this?
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
Trail’st thou the puissant pike?
Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!
Miscreant!
Caesar speaks.
God quit you in His mercy.
Poor souls, they perished.
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
I prithee, recount some of them.
Oh, no.
Tis a world to see, How tame, when men and women are alone, A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.— Give me thy hand, Kate.
This speech of yours hath moved me, And shall perchance do good.
Wondrous heavy.
Nothing certainer.
Bid me tear the bond.
Peace, ho!
Sweet bodements!
The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us, for they bear them on their shoulders.
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
Very well.
Michael Cassio, Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, Is come on shore.
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
By th' clock ’tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras.
This cannot be, By no assay of reason.
If it be so as so ’tis put on me— And that in way of caution—I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honor.
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.
To see no pastime I.
Oh, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge.
Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case.
Will you have me, lady?
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade The region of my heart.
Tomorrow is the day.
That same villain, Romeo.
I will leave him.
The king rises.
No, truly.
He dreams.
Not so, sir, I do care for something.
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord, For we will hear, note, and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience washed As pure as sin with baptism.
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied.
The foul practice Hath turned itself on me.
Feel you your legs?
Ready, so please your grace.
Buy food, and get thyself in flesh.— Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.
Bid that welcome Which comes to punish us, and we punish it, Seeming to bear it lightly.
Oh, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!
All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thornbush, my thornbush; and this dog, my dog.
Then murder’s out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh.
Go, call him hither, boy   No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels Hath he so long held out with me, untired, And stops he now for breath?
But yet hie you to Egypt again.
Coraggio, bully-monster,  If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
He is the only man of Italy, Always excepted my dear Claudio.
Truly, I have him, but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal.
Legged like a man and his fins like arms!
Not a whit, Touchstone.
One?
How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
Tis a point of wisdom.
Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
Kind sister, thanks.
Come one more.
It is hypocrisy against the devil.
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is—
You have me, have you not?
By this sword, I will.
Even now a tailor called me in his shop And showed me silks that he had bought for me, And therewithal took measure of my body.
We never valued this poor seat of England And therefore, living hence, did give ourself To barbarous license, as ’tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home.
Why, the hot-blooded France that dowerless took Our youngest born—I could as well be brought To knee his throne, and, squirelike, pension beg To keep base life afoot.
O, unpleasing news!
This, Casca.
Where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish.
Worthy prince, I know ’t.
All ports I’ll bar.
Read it, Mark Antony!
Yet say I, he is in love.
The hand of death hath raught him.
Is ’t possible?
Besides, it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew, He would not take it.
That’s not so good now.
Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face.
Give welcome to my friend.
I am weary of you. 
Oh, let the heavens Give him defense against the elements, For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.
Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him.
Do not believe That, from the sense of all civility, I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.
She is dead.
No, if without more words you will get you hence.
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act.
It was divided Between her heart and lips.
What’s the news with thee?
How does my wife?
Nay, then, thou mock’st me.
What art thou, fellow?
Yet thou liest in the bleak air.
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
Heard you this, Gonzalo?
It is a theme as fluent as the sea.
It is Brabantio.
Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
I should ev'n die with pity To see another thus.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.
If you deny me, fie upon your law— There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, And for the same he promised me a chain.
He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.
I speak but as I find.
Our duties, and the pledge.
Our expectation hath this day an end.
Why then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish.
If they will fight with us, bid them come down, Or void the field.
It were well The general were put in mind of it.
Hence, horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me!
Let me come to her.
Bring me no more reports.
Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire.
It hath no tongue to vex you.
And this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning.
Is it so nominated in the bond?
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.
If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.
How now?
She says you have some goodly jest in hand.
O Scotland, Scotland!
I told him what I thought, and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true.
Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms.
Nay, and most like.
Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.
Thou know’st ’tis common.
The gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you.
Go hence with diligence.
Who calls?
Throw this slave Upon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace.
Let’s stab ourselves.
Farewell, my lords.
I will challenge him.
What would you, Desdemona?
Now, then, we’ll use His countenance for the battle, which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off.
Farewell.
All eyes!
Ah, soldier!
How far’st thou, soldier?
The will!
He’s fortified against any denial. 
What else?
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne?
Eyes, look your last.
She is not, madam.
But tell not me.
But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?
I’ll help you to a horse.
Ha!
You have my consent.
Go thither, and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself, it is necessary, look your Grace, that he keep his vow and his oath.
We will persuade him, be it possible, To put on better ere he go to church.
I’d have thee live, For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.
And then came Pyramus.
My lord.
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not?
You look pale, and gaze, And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens.
I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor.
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, To countenance this horror!
The day, my friends, and all things stay for me.
Good my lord, enter.
Sir, this is the matter—  I beseech you, remember— Nay, good my lord, for mine ease, in good faith.
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
A beast, no more.
I will not fail.
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
Farewell!—God knows when we shall meet again.
I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of.
Killing swine.
Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, And to give order that no manner of person Have any time recourse unto the princes.
Good night, Lord Brutus.
Let him alone, for I remember now How he’s employed.
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop?
Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk.
But fathers that bear bags  Shall see their children kind.
But soft, but soft a while.
Art thou so hasty?
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him.
Where did you leave him?
They did, Fluellen.
I had been happy if the general camp, Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known.
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.
Not sad, my lord.
This is the fruits of whoring.
Are you not well?
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th' sailors.
Good!
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind.
I never thought him worse.
Most welcome home!
The murmuring surge That on th' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes Cannot be heard so high.
But, for certain, He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule.
This making Christians will raise the price of hogs.
It wearies me; you say it wearies you.
Go, you cot-quean, go.
Alas, gentlemen— Help, ho!— Lieutenant—sir, Montano— Help, masters!—Here’s a goodly watch indeed!
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed To make me fight at land!
On what occasion God He knows, not I, The queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary.
Nay, faith, I’ll see the church a' your back, and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.
Then is the world one.
Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound, I have by hard adventure found mine own.
No, madam, no.
A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew.
I must confess your offer is the best, And, let your father make her the assurance, She is your own; else, you must pardon me.
All will be well.
Let it alone, thou fool.
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
My friends told me as much, and I thought no less.
But, look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train.
All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
Yet I will adventure.
Is ’t like that lead contains her?
Help, ho!
Hurt him in eleven places.
Bind him, I say.
Cure her of that.
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.
What three things does drink especially provoke?
Say, what?
And that’s true too.
She speaks.
What news, what news in this our tott'ring state?
Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “ay.” And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master, That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
I know thee, Roderigo.
Madam, withdraw: the Prince, the Count, Signor Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the town are come to fetch you to church.
Yet I love thee too.
It is not nor it cannot come to good, But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
What should a man do but be merry?
I’ll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy.
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
And what to?
Oh, behold How pomp is followed!
Perchance he is not drown’d.—What think you, sailors?
In his livery Walked crowns and crownets.
On my knees I beg That you’ll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.” Good sir, no more.
Hold, then.
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
Who comes here?
Most heavy day!
My lord?
The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: “Fear not, Macbeth.
Was ever woman in this humor won?
Oh, that exceeds, they say.
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
But this is from my commission.
Dost thou lie still?
He, upon some action, Is now in durance at Malvolio’s suit, A gentleman and follower of my lady’s.
You must play Pyramus.—And Flute, you Thisbe.
How now, my hearts!
Lucentio, gentle sir.
Pray you, look not sad, Nor make replies of loathness.
Did heaven look on, And would not take their part?
Who’s there?
And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
You have astonished him.
Since the torch is out, Lie down and stray no farther.
I do not know what “poetical” is.
And what said he?
Faith, sir, so-so.
And came I not at last to comfort you?
Nor will do none tomorrow.
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
Here’s Romeo’s man.
Dead?
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris.
He longs to see your head.
You are now out of your text.
My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbors you as her kinsman, she’s nothing allied to your disorders.
See, who comes here?
What, man?
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
It shall be called “Bottom’s Dream” because it hath no bottom.
No further, sir.
Speak yet.
I have made no fault.
There’s no offense, my lord.
Caesar, thy thoughts Touch their effects in this.
An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek, A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
Not Cassio killed!
Never fear that.
Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God.
Nay, very pale.
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off.
But it was—as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. 
Good e'en, good e'en.
Thou art sure of me.
Villain, not for thy life!
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad; Else would he never so demean himself.
Nay, good goose, bite not.
As she is mine, I may dispose of her— Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death—according to our law Immediately provided in that case.
No cause, no cause.
Stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, But fear the main intendment of the Scot, Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
Think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it.
Oh, ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire.
wherefore sink you down?

I’ll be thy second.
Ay, Celia, we stayed her for your sake.
I’ll tell you in your ear.
No doubt, my lord.
This if she perform, She shall not sue unheard.

Let me comply with you in this garb—lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should more appear like entertainment than yours.
My wits faints.
No more words.

I’ll write to him a very taunting letter, And thou shalt bear it.
Why, see you not?
But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion, master of my servants, Queen o'er myself.
But, my good lord, your Graces' words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak; And do not doubt, right noble princes both, But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case.
By the eighth hour.
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
Montague!
Tomorrow will I send.
I’ll show thee the best springs.
Ay, if your self’s remembrance wrong yourself.
Oh!
Poor man!
How beauteous mankind is!
Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.
Most true.
Is ’t far you ride?
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury.— Patience awhile, good Cassio.—Come, come, Lend me a light.
I am none of these, my lord.
And so, my lord, adieu.
Good morrow, good Lieutenant.
Look how thou dream’st!
Lead me on.
Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
Horn mad, thou villain!
Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
Bid her have good heart.
Alas, poor Romeo!
Has here writ a letter to you.
Nay, but who is it?
What say’st thou, my fair flower de luce?
It stops me here, it is too much of joy.
I know you what you are, And like a sister am most loath to call Your faults as they are named.
Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits.
Twere good you do so much for charity.
And me too, good Lord!
Edmund and I have talked, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady’s.
There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition.
Tis to be doubted, madam.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmèd with your grief— A passion most resulting such a man— Cassio came hither.
What serious contemplation are you in?
Where is he?
O bitter consequence That Edward still should live “true noble prince”!
For my brother, I think he holds you well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage—surely suit ill spent and labor ill bestowed.
Tis a good hand, A frank one.
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease!
Make that good.
Therefore prepare you.
No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither.
What is ’t thou canst demand?
Is ’t possible?
I am tame, sir.
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
Sir, no.
At your noble pleasure.
In the street I met him, And in his company that gentleman.
Which is that adversary?
Am I not stayed for?
Art rich?
Have with you.
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.
But yet—   Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?
By my hand I swear, and my father’s soul, the work ish ill done.
What, keep a week away?
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.
But yet I feel I fear.
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
You speak too bitterly.
And yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play.
No, Cassio is not killed.
Say you have wronged her, sir.
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
What dost thou think?
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night.
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks, A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon, Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, All scattered in the bottom of the sea.
A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable, profitable neither, As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.
I cry your worships' mercy, heartily.—I beseech your worship’s name.
What was the second noise for?
Oh, that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work today.
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole.
I dare make his answer, none.
And the creature run from the cur?
Therefore go.
The sorrow that I have by right is yours, And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
Romeo must not live.
Give him tending.
What’s that?
I’ll slit the villain’s nose that would have sent me to the jail.
Then half Signor Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in Signor Benedick’s face— With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if he could get her goodwill.
What’s the matter?
Good countrymen, let me depart alone.
I could find in my heart to beat him—   But that the poor monster’s in drink.
No medicine in the world can do thee good.
Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her, Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune; But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
Because they are not eight?
Nothing?
He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love, but as you feared him.
I might do ’t as well i' th' dark.
My spirits are nimble.
How can that be?
An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
Pray, write down, “Borachio.”—Yours, sirrah?
Something have you heard Of Hamlet’s “transformation”—so call it Since nor th' exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was.
Come, you are too severe a moraler.
Oh, this false soul of Egypt!
These are unsightly tricks.
I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.
Will you go with me?
Your part in her you could not keep from death, But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
Is she not a modest young lady?
Yea, yea, my lord.
With another, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?
My creditors grow cruel.
How now, what news?
Know, my long lord, The marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.
Arise, I say!
Not yet.”      The hour’s now come.
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
Next month with us.
The lamentable change is from the best; The worst returns to laughter.
I have been told so of many.
We did keep time, sir, in our catches.
For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old, and so— But she knows what she does.
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin!
What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
I’ll not be forsworn.
Oh, wretched villain!
I gave you all— And in good time you gave it.
Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done ’t.
Hark, hark!
Did he never make you laugh?
But when they should endure the bloody spur, They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades, Sink in the trial.
Stand still.
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither?
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.
Dined at home”?
To our shores Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, Unarmed and unresolved to beat them back.
Let me shake thy hand.
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valor and put up your sword.
Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all.
He did, and from my finger snatched that ring.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, And strike you home without a messenger.
Thyself shalt see the act.
Pray you Be ever known to patience.
If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.
Good my friends, consider You are my guests.
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
That’s certain—if the devil may be her judge.
I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool.
I must be gone.
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral.
Let them come in.
I’ll tell thee, Charles: it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
How are they escoted?
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
A goodly one, in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
Hortensio, peace.
And what’s to come of my despisèd time Is naught but bitterness.
This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.
Pale or red?
Therefore use thy discretion.
I am glad on ’t.
The rest shall keep as they are.
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters.
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear A fearful battle rendered you in music.
How is ’t, brother!
To that end, As matching to his youth and vanity, I did present him with the Paris balls.
Brother Anthony—
He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him.
If they have done this deed, my noble lord— If?
Your names?
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
Farewell, kind Charmian.
Roundly replied.
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?
Unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt.
The slip, sir, the slip.
And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war.
If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
I will o’ertake thee, Cleopatra, and Weep for my pardon.
What’s the matter?
Oh, well-a-day, Lady!
There is something else.
Farewell, sweet playfellow.
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel, And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there’s gold.
I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram, conjured to this effect, He wrought upon her.
Who hath made this havoc with them?
I am your neighbor, and was suitor first.
My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
And when that time comes, Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not, As till that time I shall not pity thee.
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
The “why” is plain as way to parish church: He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob.
Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall t' expel the winter’s flaw!
Thou livest.
Tis he.
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
Goblin, lead them up and down.
Speak.
I cannot blame her.
Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.
Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And waving our red weapons o'er our heads Let’s all cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop, then, and wash.
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights.
Good madam, stay a while.
Good Grumio, fetch it me.
Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?
Upon a lie seven times removed.—Bear your body more seeming, Audrey.—As thus, sir: I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard.
Your ear is good.
What do you call the play?
I pray thee, let us go and find him out And quicken his embracèd heaviness With some delight or other.
Look what is done cannot be now amended.
Is there more toil?
I will plague them all, Even to roaring.
Take them away.
Please you, draw near.—Louder the music there!
Before my body I throw my warlike shield.
Where’s my son Edmund?
Be these the wretches that we played at dice for?
But I pray you, who is his companion?
Yea, and text underneath: “Here dwells Benedick the married man”?
But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood.
Thy Juliet is alive, For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead— There art thou happy.
Peace, ho!
Gallants, I am not as I have been.
Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being crossed in conference by some senators.
Now, fellow, What is there?
They know your Grace hath cause and means and might; So hath your Highness.
The handkerchief!
Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still, And happily we might be interrupted.
So call the field to rest, and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day.
Adieu.
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea monster.
Let him bless thee too.
I thank your Honor.
Madam, I trust, not so.
What’s done is done.
How is ’t, Laertes?
The Duke’s in council and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for.
Your constancy Hath left you unattended.
We are three of them.
Their preparation is today by sea.
What is the matter?
How fares your majesty?
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
Here.
Thanks to your majesty.
Wherefore?
He, for his father’s sake, so loves the prince That he will not be won to aught against him.
Let me say “Amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew. 
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly.
I pray God he be not, I say.
He bears too great a mind.
Brutus, my lord.
Come, your answer in broken music, for thy voice is music and thy English broken.
Whither wander you?
Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt— Whom leprosy o’ertake!—i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight, When vantage like a pair of twins appeared Both as the same, or rather ours the elder, The breeze upon her, like a cow in June, Hoists sails and flies.
Thou canst not choose but know who I am.
For this pains Caesar hath hanged him.
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.
Therefore prepare thyself.
Let him answer me.— Come, follow me, boy.
Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
And so return to you, and nothing else?
I think I hear them.—Stand, ho!
Upon my life, by some device or other The villain is o'erraught of all my money.

The king and queen and all are coming down.
I am glad of your departure.

The transgression is in the stealer.
Invest me in my motley.

Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature.
What heir of York is there alive but we?
Let each man render me his bloody hand.
But did’st thou see them dead?
What promise, chuck?
Ay, sir, for three months.
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love.
That’s her torment.
Thou didst it excellent.
You rub the sore When you should bring the plaster.
No, not till a hot January.
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman well-reputed, Cato’s daughter.
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
I shall take it, sir.
We looked not for Mark Antony here.
It were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of blind Cupid.
Shall I do such a deed?
Then I will come to my mother by and by.
Wilt thou, Silvius?
And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver.
See what a rent the envious Casca made.

How now, interjections?
She lives.
All myself?

Let him approach.
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
Art thou afeard?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Knock, knock, knock!
Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better.
The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back.
And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.
So please you— What says the fellow there?
Nay, pray be covered.
I will walk up and down here and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.
Leave me, Iago.
A grievous fault.—Say, woman, didst thou so?
Stanley, he is your wife’s son.
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter, After your own sense, yea, though our proper son Stood in your action.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, An hour but married, Tybalt murderèd, Doting like me, and like me banishèd, Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground, as I do now, Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
I' th' mire.
Do not presume too much upon my love.
And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
By the fire That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war As thou affects.
The wager thou hast won, and I will add Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns, Another dowry to another daughter, For she is changed as she had never been.

And by all means stir on the youth to an answer.
There is ten thousand— Geese, villain?
Does he rave?
She’s dead, my Queen.
Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece—that’s a wise man and a fool.
Said he not so?
Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects.
Where, my lord?

O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?

What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?
Tis my picture.
If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son, As you have whispered faithfully you were, And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limned and living in your face, Be truly welcome hither.

But if you be remembered, I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold, “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.” Why, that’s the lady.
That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.
My lord, his throat is cut.
My brother never Did urge me in his act.
There is none but he Whose being I do fear, and under him My genius is rebuked, as it is said Mark Antony’s was by Caesar.
How now, sirrah!
I’ll cross it though it blast me.—Stay, illusion!
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
Oh, I am slain!
Madam!
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth Of what we think against thee.
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope, Have lost their quality, and that this day Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
Why then, God forgive me.
Good.
Ha, what sayest thou?
Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valor armed, Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbished arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault.
We’ll see 'em starve first.
but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it.
Murellus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar’s images, are put to silence.
I say a husband.
His captain’s heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gypsy’s lust.
Farewell, kind master.
He is addressed.
Why, how now, Dromio.

One side will mock another—th' other too.
His counsel now might do me golden service.
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers, Caius.
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
From both, my lord.
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world, and having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.
No, nor mine now.
False to me?
My lord, that would dishonor him!
Nay, by 'r Lady, that I think he cannot.
That dreamers often lie.
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death.
Why, she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on, and yet, within a month— Let me not think on ’t.
I know not, madam.
Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess, Made mine eyes water—but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed.
My noble brother!
Wisely and slow.
Lovers, to bed.
My mind is changed.
But since he is better we have therefore odds.
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.
Welcome, my friends all.
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side.
Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
I do not think ’t.
Say you?

Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound.
Must I bite?
We’ll enter all together.
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?

Still live they, and forever let them last.
Graces will appear, and there’s an end.
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us.
Come, sir, to dinner.—Dromio, keep the gate.
Avaunt, thou witch!—Come, Dromio, let us go.
Ay, when the special thing is well obtained, That is, her love, for that is all in all.
From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawned, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards with their assigns—as girdle, hangers, and so.
Hey, Mountain, hey!
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.
I’ll leave thee Now like a man of steel.
Trouble yourselves no further.
Out of my sight!
An there be any matter of weight chances, call up me.
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed, And it portends alone the fall of Antony.
My good friends, I’ll leave you till night.
Now go thy way.
Tomorrow dinner, then?
Myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The king my father wracked.
I was killed i' th' Capitol.
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
So, slave, hence!
Farewell!
Let me see, let me see.
For shame, put on your gown.
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.
For I am sick when I do look on thee.
An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues.
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
Good my lord.
There be land rats and water rats, water thieves and land thieves—I mean pirates—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.
The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night.
I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.
Do not say so, my lord.
This is a sleepy tune.
Never king of England Had nobles richer, and more loyal subjects, Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilioned in the fields of France.
I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else.
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.
Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and bound.
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends— O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!
What do you here?
Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” And well said too—for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honorable Without the stamp of merit?
The most you sought was her promotion, For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced.
If you do love me you will find me out.— Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
You have made me offer Of Sicily, Sardinia.
The Duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, Even on the instant.
Approach, my Ariel, come.
The life”?
He goes forth gallantly.
Am I your man?
God grant we never may have need of you.
Ha?
Dost thou know me, fellow?
Will you to Scone?
Come, my young soldier, put up your iron.
I’ll pheeze you, in faith.
To do thus I learned of thee.
If it please His Majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me.
Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
That Herod’s head I’ll have!
For that goes hard.
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!
And most poor matters Point to rich ends.
Why, would not you?
Say that she frown; I’ll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly washed with dew.
When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake.—And so everyone according to his cue.
These be good humors.
Sir, I shall study deserving.
That’s all one.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
Here comes the lady.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward, noble York My princely father then had wars in France, And, by true computation of the time, Found that the issue was not his begot, Which well appearèd in his lineaments, Being nothing like the noble duke my father.
But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud, The universal landlord.
Your lord does know my mind.
Signor, you are very near my brother in his love.
Give ear, sir, to my sister.
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Of a snail?
God save the foundation!
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
Was not Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?
Alas, who knows?
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.
What men may do!
I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
You were to blame, I must be plain with you, To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift, A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
Antony only, that would make his will Lord of his reason.
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
Friends to this ground.
Neither good nor bad.
I am not here.
Was ’t you he rescued?
I will fetch you light, and paper, and ink.
Marry, for my part, I think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man.
But as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here.
What is his name?
Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not.
My lord, he doth deny to come.
Note this before my notes: There’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting.
Away, then!
The world esteemed thy father honorable, But I did find him still mine enemy.
Of anything the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance.
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
But lest myself be guilty to self wrong, I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song.
Oh, I die for food.
As I!
So do the kings of France unto this day, Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked titles Usurped from you and your progenitors.
Not that I know.
If Caesar please, our master Will leap to be his friend.
No, my lord, unless I might have another for working days.
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
How “seventh cause”?—Good my lord, like this fellow.
We’ll see our husbands Before they think of us.
What dost thou profess?
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.
Therefore, great King, We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
Tis certain there’s not a boy left alive, and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter.
Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say, There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king.
Other women cloy The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies, for vilest things Become themselves in her, that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish.
That’s the next to do.
I pray you, have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower.
He, sir.
Do you confess the bond?
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.
The moon is down.
O Goneril, You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face.
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!
Why, so didst thou.
Well, keep me company but two years more, Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
Come forth, I say!
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.
What shall I say?
Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing.
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave.
The strings, my lord, are false.
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
I shaked you, sir, and cried.
Nay, good, be patient.
I have heard my father name him.
Why then, my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula Are much deceived, for they did swear you did.
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes And still conclusion, shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me.
My old brain is troubled.
Then move not, while my prayer’s effect I take.
I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
You amaze me.
The gods confound thee!
I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.
Light, gentlemen, I’ll bind it with my shirt.
I have a ship Laden with gold.
Then have at you with my wit.
His affections do not that way tend.
And begged he pardon?
But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one.
One kiss, and I’ll descend.
Besides, I have some business in the town.
I know not what to say.
Tell me your mind.
M”—why, that begins my name.
Go, make money.
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.
And Cassius too.
And I do think she’s thirty.
I follow him to serve my turn upon him.
Was never mother had so dear a loss.
Is not this man jealous?
Yes.
I am changed.
My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?
In the meantime, let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
God mark thee to his grace!
My lord?
Farewell, dear mother.
Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.—  Off, off, you lendings!
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
All men I hope live so.
Nay, guiltiness Will speak, though tongues were out of use.
Yes, other men have ill luck too.
You have done well by water.
Come.
Three times today my foot-cloth horse did stumble, And started when he looked upon the Tower, As loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse.
Who?
He shall tell them so.
We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites: If we obey them not, this will ensue: They’ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
Do I entice you?
Then I know My answer must be made.
So fare you well.
Come, let us to the banquet.
Poor Tom shall lead thee.
And so the lion vanished.
Enough to purchase what you have made known.
But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old.
I saw no man use you at his pleasure.
Hence!
Canst thou, when thou command’st the beggar’s knee, Command the health of it?
One Hero died defiled, but I do live, And surely as I live, I am a maid.
Good morrow, both.
No.
If thou pleasest not, I yield thee up my life.
There are my keys.—But wherefore should I go?
Wilt thou have me?
My liberty.
I am for thee straight.
Oh, be sick, great greatness, And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
Not for thy fairy kingdom.—Fairies, away!
As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
You may as well say, that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.
Let me see.
Despair and die!
Whither are they vanished?
I know not, sir.
Was ’t not to this end That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?
Wert thou not banishèd on pain of death?
Give me thy hand.
Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.
What news?
I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither.—Holla, Dennis!
I will, my lord.
At five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same.
Let’s meet him and receive him.
This health to Lepidus!
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee.
I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress.
Do, good friend.
Your worship’s friend and Launcelot, sir.
When was it she last walked?
Hortensio, hark.
And so, his knell is knolled.
And, dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained.
Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.” I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.
God rest you merry, sir.
Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss thee.
Love, and be friends as two such men should be.
She will not come.
No, no, forsooth, I dare not for my life.
Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar.
Threescore and ten I can remember well, Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings.
She’s a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me.
I will give out divers schedules of my beauty.
I’ll pull thee by the lesser legs.
God give me joy to wear it, for my heart is exceeding heavy.
Alas the day!
Call not your stocks for me.
Even here Do we shake hands.
Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
It shall be done.
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born And hath been tutored in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscurèd in the circle of this forest.
But this rough magic I here abjure, and when I have required Some heavenly music, which even now I do, To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll drown my book.
Speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped for taxation one of these days.
Fare you well, Jessica.
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of his conscience.
Nay, come, again.
Will you go see the order of the course?
For God’s sake, take a house.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry— But ’twas thy beauty that provokèd me.
And mine, two hundred.
What, did they never whisper?
I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again.
Not so, neither.
I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them.
Oh, thereby hangs a tail.
Stay here.
No, Caesar shall not.
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
Where are thy two sons?
The king would speak with Cornwall.
What, were you snarling all before I came, Ready to catch each other by the throat, And turn you all your hatred now on me?
And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont.
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head, With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart—
Your Honor wins bad humors.
Good signors both, when shall we laugh?
I am amazed and know not what to say.
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
Call to me All my sad captains.
But few of any sort, and none of name.
Well demanded, wench.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
The king himself is rode to view their battle.
I would lose all—ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil—to deliver you.
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
Up in the air, crowned with the golden sun, Saw his heroical seed and smiled to see him Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made.
Then your hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation.
Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
You are both sure, and will assist me?
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to ’t with delight.
No more.
I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth In forty minutes.
With all my heart, good youth.
Here comes the Countess.
Your loss is as yourself, great, and you bear it As answering to the weight.
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
One speech in it I chiefly loved.
This ’greed upon To part with unhacked edges and bear back Our targes undinted.
Good night then, Casca.
Here lies your way.
What infinite heart’s ease Must kings neglect that private men enjoy?
Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
It is written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets.
Things that are past are done, with me.
In honored love.
Thy husband.
And seemed I ever otherwise to you?
And her sister By her is poisoned.
True,” said she, “a fine little one.” “No,” said I, “a great wit.” “Right,” says she, “a great gross one.” “Nay,” said I, “a good wit.” “Just,” said she, “it hurts nobody.” “Nay,” said I, “the gentleman is wise.” “Certain,” said she, “a wise gentleman.” “Nay,” said I, “he hath the tongues.” “That I believe,” said she, “for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning; there’s a double tongue, there’s two tongues.” Thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues.
Good sir, be patient.
Good madam.
And she’s fair I love.
This grief is crowned with consolation.
Make haste, make haste, sirrah.
Dorset, embrace him.—Hastings, love Lord Marquess.
How can this be?  
Nay, I am for all waters.
He says they can do nothing in this kind.
Oh, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and noise.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?
Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady.
And you, sir.
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
What though I killed her husband and her father?
When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
Take it in what sense thou wilt.
I am not gamesome.
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow.
Here comes my man.
I cannot tell.
Content.
I am informèd thoroughly of the cause.
Wherefore, sweetheart?
Welcome hither.
Now, beshrew my father’s ambition!
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her.
I know not if ’t be true, But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety.
What sayest thou?
I cannot tell.
Mine eyes do itch, Doth that bode weeping?
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness.
And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies.
It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.
Despair, and die!
Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
O, gentlemen, see, see dead Henry’s wounds Open their congealed mouths and bleed afresh!— Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity, For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.
Something he left imperfect in the state which, since his coming forth, is thought of; which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary.
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
He’s dead and rotten.
Ha!
The beds i’ th’ East are soft, and thanks to you, That called me timelier than my purpose hither, For I have gained by ’t.
Where’s the Master?
We’ll away tonight, And be a day before our husbands home.
A crow without feather?
Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio.
We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Here is better than the open air.
I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria.
Good Volumnius, Thou know’st that we two went to school together.
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship.
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
But sadly, tell me who.
Look, here it is.
I’ll be with thee betimes.
You’ll “never trust his word after.” Come, ’tis a foolish saying.
Come you, sir.
Is it so long?— Call forth the holy father.
Give me.
What o' that?
O my daughter, Fled with a Christian!
Beshrew his soul for me!
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
He might have chid me so, for, in good faith, I am a child to chiding.
I will, my lord.
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours, How honorable and how kindly we Determine for her, for Caesar cannot live To be ungentle.
O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.
Uncle, I must come forth.
Is she shrill-tongued or low?
Ah, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
What, shall we toward the Tower?
Not a jot more, my lord.
Indeed?
These lily lips, This cherry nose, These yellow cowslip cheeks Are gone, are gone.
Ah, this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on ’t!
My lord and lady, it is now our time, That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper, To cry, “Good joy, good joy, my lord and lady!” My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady, I wish you all the joy that you can wish, For I am sure you can wish none from me.
It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.
Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity.
Knock, sir?
Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.
That you shall surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the raisèd search, And there will I be with him.
Because that, like a jack, thou keep’st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
Because their business still lies out o' door.
Sojourn in Mantua.
A guiltless death I die.
Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe.
What is here?
You kiss by th' book.
Why, he was met even now As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud, Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds, With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn.—A century send forth.
Here in these confines slyly have I lurked To watch the waning of mine enemies.
Bear with him, Brutus.
Speak, man.
Take away the fool, gentlemen.
What if I strayed no further, but chose here?
And that is Claudio.
Do not torment me.
He says for Brutus' sake He finds himself beholding to us all.
Give you good night.
A match!
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
More light and light it grows.
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man.
What tell’st thou me of robbing?
My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was ’t to you?
He did in some sort, indeed, handle women, but then he was rheumatic, and talked of the Whore of Babylon.
Here comes the count.
A gentleman.
But the rarity of it is—which is indeed almost beyond credit—  As many vouched rarities are.
Out, treacherous villain!
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand, Which must be acted ere they may be scanned.
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, I’ll pay it presently with all my heart.
Oh, that I were a man!
Send one presently to Sir Toby.
It makes me mad.
Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you.— Come, my dear love, The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue: That profit’s yet to come ’tween me and you.
I pray you, look upon her.
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.
Husband, I’ll dine above with you today, And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants.
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine; then fly abreast, As in this glorious and well-foughten field We kept together in our chivalry.” Upon these words I came and cheered him up.
O you sir, you, come you hither, sir.
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
What answer, sir?
Well, say, sir.
Your children were vexation to your youth, But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found.
I’ll be with thee straight.
Claribel.
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe.
Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have passed upon her.
O royal Caesar!
Leave him to my displeasure.—Edmund, keep you our sister company.
Goes Fleance with you?
Sword” is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
Well shone, Moon!—Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.
You are the lord of duty.
The main descry Stands in the hourly thought.
Oh, that I were a fool!
I will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
I will not have to do with you.
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
He’s coming hither—now, i' th' night, i' th' haste, And Regan with him.
He sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was.
Fears and scruples shake us.
His grace speaks cheerfully.
I am not such an ass, but I can keep my hand dry.
Have you no more to say?
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady.
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep.
My more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia’s death.
Canst thou blame him?
O, let her live, And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed, Throw over her the veil of infamy.
Will it never be day?
If he come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment.
And laid the love juice on some true love’s sight.
My good lord.
Tell her the king, that may command, entreats— That, at her hands, which the king’s King forbids.
For certain, sir, he is not.
Why, what’s a moveable?
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon, For he was great of heart.
O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!
Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, Nor no such men as you have reckoned up, As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece, And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell, And twenty more such names and men as these, Which never were, nor no man ever saw.
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
What noise is this?
So please your majesty That we may wake the king?
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
I’ll keep my oath Patiently to bear my wroth.”
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
Take my sword.
Let it work, For ’tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard.
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou to deny thou knowest me!
We are friends.
I’ll back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so.
The near in blood, The nearer bloody.
Seyton!—I am sick at heart, When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
And you, good sir.
Know thus far forth: By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune (Now my dear lady) hath mine enemies Brought to this shore.
Go you with me and I will use your skill.— Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
Tut, there’s life in ’t, man. 
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you.
I must to the barber’s, monsieur, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about the face.
Sir, there she stands.
Nay, I hope.
Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself.
Why art thou here, Come from the farthest step of India?
Stay, stand apart.
Do you come near me now?
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
Well, that is the dowry of his wife; ’tis none of his own getting.
That love i begged for you he begged of me.
Bring thou the master to the citadel.
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
I must hence to wait.
Swart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept.
Oh, yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
I will not swear these are my hands.
I hope they will not come upon us now.
I am ready now.
That is the voice, Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
We wait upon your Grace.
For many miles about There’s scarce a bush.
O, that thou wert not, poor distressèd soul!
Where have you hid yourself?
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drowned?
How came we ashore?
Shall I descend?
I’ll come to thee straight.
I hear some noise.
Let him go up into the public chair.
Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
No.
Feed and sleep.
First, of my word!
How, the nonpareil!
I know not.
His reason well I know.
Be collected.
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, Alike bewitchèd by the charm of looks, But to his foe supposed he must complain, And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.
Honest Nurse, farewell.
If this fall into thy hand, revolve.
You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field You do me mischief.
But for the bloody napkin?
Armed, say you?
Father, in.
Bonos dies, Sir Toby.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
I do not like her name.
Do you not know I am a woman?
Brutus, bait not me.
I shall obey, my lord.
Dromio—thou, Dromio—thou snail, thou slug, thou sot.
Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age.
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
He only in a general honest thought And common good to all, made one of them.
Spake you of Caesar?
I do not like the office.
Go thou.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite.
I never saw an action of such shame.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
And speak parrot?
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
Well then, sustain me.
Virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begged it and indeed Deserved it too.
A bridegroom, say you?
Tis the curse of service.
Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest.
I know your favor well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.— Take him away.
I am content.
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
Come, away.
Master Fer.
Well, sir, I will.
He taught me how to know a man in love, in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
There is means, madam.
he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state, as at that time Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel.
Hear the ambassadors.
It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
All things are ready if our minds be so.
Draw, you rogue, for though it be night yet the moon shines.
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
Fetch thy master home.
And died so?
She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.
Or docks, or mallows.
Well, be it so.
Here.
Near and on speedy foot.
Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard.
Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you To make it wander in an unknown field?
Fie, what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no!
What, not one hit?
I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel.
A piece of him.
Tom, away!
How now, Roderigo!
And be not easily won to our requests.
How canst thou try them so?
Nay, indeed if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me.
So-so” is good, very good, very excellent good.
What sayst thou to him?
Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor.
What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done.
Enobarbus, Antony Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with His bounty overplus.
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
We are arrant knaves, all.
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose.
We shall ne'er be younger.
Sink Rome!
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper.
Horrible sight!
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
The order was reversed.
And why not the swift foot of time?
Come, sir.
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
A merry whoreson, ha!
If but as well I other accents borrow, That can my speech diffuse, my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I razed my likeness.
Right well, dear madam.
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.

That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match.

No passage?
Your mistress bears well.
I doubt it is no other but the main: His father’s death and our o'erhasty marriage.
Tis time I should inform thee farther.
Sit, Jessica.
Here is yet a postscript.
You know me well, and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance.
Dull thing, I say so.
In faith, she’s too curst.

How dost thou, my good fellow?
Hold!
And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too.

Brutus speaks.
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
I had my father’s signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal.
Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife, No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, But “banishèd” to kill me?—“Banishèd”!
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune, Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider, Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?

Pray you, go with us.
O my heart!
Why, what is Tybalt?
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit, And thence to France shall we convey you safe And bring you back, charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass; for, if we may, We’ll not offend one stomach with our play.
Farewell.
Knock you here, sir?
You may do your will, But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.
Pray you sit still.
We took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate.
What canst thou swear by now?
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.— Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.
Not I, sir.
Would I were satisfied!
Did he receive you well?
He’s bound unto Octavia.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and so husbanded?
Go on before.
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess, Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend, I’ll break a custom.
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all, All, all cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.

Even as men wracked upon a sand, that look to be washed off the next tide.
His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse.
For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee?
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat.
Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench, and all grease, and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
And we will mend thy wages.
But for a fine, quaint, graceful, and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on ’t.
Use them after your own honor and dignity.
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say The gods themselves do weep!
She has robbed me of my sword.
No, truly, for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry, and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
Have you a soul or sense?
Urge the necessity and state of times, And be not peevish found in great designs.
Come, come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars!
Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.
A laughter.
In spite of your heart, I think.
Nay, let him alone.
At my lodging.
Are you our daughter?
On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease.
But if these— As I am sure they do—bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress?
What, ho, Brabantio!
Wilt thou have music?
She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
She’s cold.
Dolabella!
Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot, Wherein I thee endowed.
Heaven knows what she has known.
Dost thou think so, spirit?
Would it be better, madam, than I am?
Haply a woman’s voice may do some good, When articles too nicely urged be stood on.
Messala!
Nay, let’s follow him.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous— Where is your mother?
Whither away?
Know, Claudio, to thy head, Thou hast so wronged mine innocent child and me That I am forced to lay my reverence by, And with gray hairs and bruise of many days Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent.
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me.
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will.
So it appears by that I have to say.
No evil lost is wailed when it is gone.
How hast thou lost thy breath?
That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in.
Adieu.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death.
Freedom!
You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not.

Was not this love indeed?
Give me audience, good madam.
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol.
Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.
This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife With wealth enough, and young and beauteous, Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!
I did not think to draw my sword ’gainst Pompey, For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me.
Go to.
Fare thee well at once.
Went he hence now?
That’s the end.
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the bark  The fellow is distract, and so am I, And here we wander in illusions.
I grant you.
Oh, heaven have mercy on me!
Lend me a looking-glass.
I loved you ever.
Say, how is that?
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit.
So fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history.
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body.
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
First, he commends him to your noble self.
Now forth, Lord Constable and princes all, And quickly bring us word of England’s fall.
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end.
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, Which after-hours give leisure to repent.
Pray you now, forget and forgive.
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
Adieu.
Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man.
Cursed be I that did so!
Thou hast, Ventidius, that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction.
For us, we will consider of this further.
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife.
Alas, alas!
Well thought on.
But how hath she received his love?
I stretch it out for that word “broad,” which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan.
Good madonna, why mournest thou?
Those that were your father’s enemies Have steeped their galls in honey, and do serve you With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
Is thy news good, or bad?
See where they come.
Mark me.
Your eyes do menace me.
Come, Nerissa.—
Great and increasing.
Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us.
I am not furnished with the present money.
I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother, Who prays continually for Richmond’s good.
I am ashamèd I did yield to them.
I will to Venice.
Pardon me.
When I like your favor, for God defend the lute should be like the case!
Who’s there?
But where the greater malady is fixed The lesser is scarce felt.
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
And what say’st thou then to my love?
My niece is already in the belief that he’s mad.
You take my life When you do take the means whereby I live.
Tis well for thee That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt.
There’s mine.
My life were better ended by their hate Than death proroguèd, wanting of thy love.
How now, gentleman?
It is the best horse of Europe.
What is ’t?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
Yet is this no charm for the toothache.—Old Signior, walk aside with me.
Never, my lord.
Ha!
He’ll be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him.
Here comes your father.
Yes, I am.
I will requite your loves.
Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropped.
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you.
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “ay.” Enough of this.
So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away.
I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute.
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast—and but twelve persons there!
That is where we dined, Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.
Sailors, my lord, they say.
Laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth.  
There was, for a while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.
I had it of him.
Buzz, buzz.
I little thought You would have followed.
But I have none.
We thank your Honor.
Why sinks that cauldron?
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead, And Paris too.
I know not what ’twas but distraction.
No?
Tis fittest.
Would all were well—but that will never be.
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
Murder!
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.
You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern.
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls.
And friends with Caesar.
If justice cannot tame you, she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance.
Fare you well, sir.
Put on your nightgown.
That’s fouler.
Where is your husband?
Invoke his warlike spirit And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince, Who on the French ground played a tragedy, Making defeat on the full power of France Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp Forage in blood of French nobility.
That’s a fault.
By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for. 
I do assure thee, father, so it is.
Fly, fly, my lord.
Perdie, your doors were locked, and you shut out.
I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
Good, good, the justice of it pleases!
I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.
That’s good.
I would I were thy bird.
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago.
Why, sir, what’s your conceit in that?
That’s as much as to say, the sweet youth’s in love.
Have you no more to say?
Prates too.—What say you, James Soundpost?
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, To find his title with some shows of truth, Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught, Conveyed himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare, Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great.
Hast thou slain him then?
Hath she forgot already that brave prince, Edward, her lord, whom I some three months since Stabbed in my angry mood at Tewkesbury?
My father’s bears more toward the marketplace.
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence, Seek through your camp to find you.
That high All-seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feignèd prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest.
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.— Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office.
Go armed.
I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Richard, Earl of Cambridge.
Therefore give me no counsel.
His majesty, Tend'ring my person’s safety, hath appointed This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
Come, civil night, Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave Is wandered forth, in care to seek me out.
I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions.
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
To whose hands You have sent the lunatic king.
Put on my crown.
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.
Well, you are gone both ways.
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak, Your reconciler!
killed a cat?
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
I here do give thee that with all my heart Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee.
And yonder, Caesar.
Know me for Brutus!
What sayest thou now?
He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence.
I thank thee for that jest.
I will, my lord.
You have it full, Benedick.
Will your grace command me any service to the world’s end?
What grows of it, no matter.
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse, Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight.
Most gracious Duke, To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice, T' assist my simpleness.
We’ll wait upon your lordship.
This was a merry message.
Hail!
Let good Antonio look he keep his day, Or he shall pay for this.
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
My lord.
No more with me.
Stands he or sits he?
You, sir?
I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
You have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady.
Horrible steep.
Father, I am glad you are come.
Will you go, sister?—Shepherd, ply her hard.
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
I will be satisfied.
He sought my life, But lately, very late.
We shall, my liege.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her, And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter, Unless you will accompany me thither.
He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that.
Well, let it strike.
But it is no matter.
I thank God, I thank God!
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt, And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.
But I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often laudable, to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly.
Then let us both be sudden.
He is very near by this.
God will revenge it.
She is herself a dowry.
Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.” Must give—for what?
Nothing.
I’ll have no bigger.
I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it.
He is as disproportioned in his manners As in his shape.— Take with you your companions.
I will confess it to all the 'orld.
Thrice within this hour I saw him down, thrice up again and fighting.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.
How now?
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in.
Why Romeo, art thou mad?
Tis mine and I will have it.
The honorable lady of the house, which is she?
Dear sir, forbear!
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks.
It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
Your Majesty shall mock at me.
We shall further think on ’t.
Yet touch this sparingly, as ’twere far off, Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
The king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words.
Ay, but he will not now be pacified.
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment.
The words expressly are “a pound of flesh.” Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh, But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice.
I never gave him cause.
But you’ll be secret?
There’s my hand.
We have lost best half of our affair.
Your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing.
I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.
Lord Hamlet— Heaven secure him!
Disloyal?
Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
It lies in you.
Twill not be seen in him there.
This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savor Of other your new pranks.
But hush, no more.
If I could win a lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife.
Be wise, and get you home.
I thank you for your company, but, good faith, I had as lief have been myself alone.
I am not merry, but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise.
Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
No, sir.
Is there any ships put forth tonight?
I cannot fly, But, bearlike, I must fight the course.
Oh!
Come, come.
What, frighted with false fire?
Death and damnation!
If knife, drugs, serpents, have Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe.
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
I know you are of her bosom.
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
What think you on ’t?
Faith, her privates we.
You knew—none so well, none so well as you—of my daughter’s flight.
Idle old man That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away!
Come.
Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome.
Followed the old man forth.
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
I know him to be valiant.
Whither should I fly?
Baptista is a noble gentleman, To whom my father is not all unknown, And were his daughter fairer than she is, She may more suitors have, and me for one.
The Moor’s abused by some most villainous knave, Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
Send for the county.
Ah, but I think him better than I say, And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
My mistress, sir,” quoth I.
Would the night were come!
Lead me on.
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing.
The town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the breach, and we talk and, be Chrish, do nothing, ’tis shame for us all.
They’ll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour.
So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun, King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim, King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear To hold in right and title of the female.
Who is that calls so coldly?
Where’s thy drum?
Nay, heaven doth know.
What say you, Bottom?
What mar you then, sir?
You were sent for, and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to color.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret.
I know by that same eye there’s some good news.
Where is she?
Follow him, friends.
How goes it now?
A lover is more condoling.
Nay, then, good night our part.
Hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
Who comes here?
Read thou this challenge.
What is thy name?
Hear you the news abroad?
About the ninth hour, lady.
Ay, let the county take you in your bed.
This is a fellow of the selfsame color Our sister speaks of.—Come, bring away the stocks!
So ’tis to thee.
Therefore be patient.
Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a double-dealer.
Tomorrow, Before the sun shall see ’s, we’ll spill the blood That has today escaped.
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
Did not you speak?
In her consists my happiness and thine.
Pray you, sit down, For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
Ay, or any show that you will show him.
Amen to that, sweet powers!
What mean you, Caesar?
How have I offended?
Come thee on.
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
Let go!
If he do, sure he cannot weep ’t back again.
Why, but you are now well enough.
I am in this commanded to deliver The noble duke of Clarence to your hands.
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king.
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
Who meets us here?
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends!
For in all the play There is not one word apt, one player fitted.
Her father is Baptista Minola, An affable and courteous gentleman.
Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.
The same.
And earthly power doth then show likest God’s When mercy seasons justice.
Now is the day we long have lookèd for.
Come.
What, we have many goodly days to see!
And here will rest me.
Here the street is narrow.
Wherefore?
But tell me true, are you not mad indeed?
Though our lives— Your spirits shine through you.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
Ay, madam.
Here’s a madman will murder me.
What say you sir?
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer.
Make haste.
You see how simple and how fond I am.
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
Marry, come up, I trow.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
I’ll apprehend him.
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor.
No.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded?
What, master, read you?
Have you that I sent you for?
He that sweetest rose will find Must find love’s prick, and Rosalind.
These Moors are changeable in their wills—fill thy purse with money.
He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show?
Oh, defend me!
My bond to the Jew is forfeit.
No more.
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
Hark, Petruchio: she says she’ll see thee hanged first.
Then you’ll buy 'em to sell again.
What, An advocate for an imposter?
Why, stay and hear me speak.
How may we try it further?
You know, he brought me out o' favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
May ’t please your highness sit.
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover’s grace.
I have them ready.
Peace, ho!
What says your Highness to my just request?
I think it well, my lord.
I have forsworn his bed and company.
I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.
Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee!
What would you have?
Dost fall?
They steal hearts.
What ho, Horatio!
Marry, that can Hero!
Well met, Corporal Nym.
What gentleman?
Fiery”?
No better.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
Repose you there, while I to this hard house— More harder than the stones whereof ’tis raised, Which even but now, demanding after you, Denied me to come in—return, and force Their scanted courtesy.
It is to be all made of fantasy, All made of passion and all made of wishes, All adoration, duty, and observance, All humbleness, all patience and impatience, All purity, all trial, all observance, And so am I for Phoebe.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
Fare you well.
Come, sirs.
Will ’t please your highness walk?
Hear me yet, good Shylock.
This is the latest parle we will admit.
The first that there did greet my stranger-soul Was my great father-in-law, renownèd Warwick, Who spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?” And so he vanished.
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more.
There’s money for thee.
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
Zounds, who is there?
You have heard him swear downright he was.
No, ’twas the vane on the house.
Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
Swagger?
Are you native of this place?
I durst not!
You knew my father well, and in him me, Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, Which I have bettered rather than decreased.
Not I, I must be found.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Go to, you are too shrewd.
That head, my lord?
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
If love have touched you, naught remains but so:   Gramercies, lad, go forward.
You have an excellent armor, but let my horse have his due.
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
I have so often blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazed to it.
Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell, But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands.
Is he well?
Abominable villain!
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
Not so.
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
And, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh.
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
I pray thee, peace.
Peace then!
He that knows better how to tame a shrew, Now let him speak; ’tis charity to show.
If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in everything, and so dance out the answer.
No more amazement.
It makes us, or it mars us.
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd? 
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth.
Is Romeo slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead?
He comes upon a wish.
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholy, Lightens my humor with his merry jests.
This would drink deep.
He is wise, And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
You know not what you do.
Behold it stained With his most noble blood.
He hath given his empire Up to a whore; who now are levying The kings o’ th’ earth for war.
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
Ay, better than him I am before knows me.
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.
Fa, sol, la, mi. 
For, my good liege, she is so idly kinged, Her scepter so fantastically borne By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth, That fear attends her not.
I think he will stand very strong with us.
The wager?
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
Leave holloaing, man.
But little.
Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.
Come on.
Ha, art thou bedlam?
He’s a friend of the Duke Alençon’s. 
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will.
Moved,” in good time.
Quick, quick!
Farewell, farewell.
O, preposterous And frantic outrage, end thy damnèd spleen, Or let me die, to look on death no more.
It came even from the heart of—oh, she’s dead!
That from your first of difference and decay Have followed your sad steps.
What woman’s man?
He.
It may well be called Jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit.
What’s the matter with thee now?
My naked weapon is out.
Now go to the door and stay there till we call.
Come, let us to the castle.
I think thou dost.
I shall be much bound to you for ’t.
peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do ’t.
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
It is my lady.
Saving your merry humor, here’s the note How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion, Which doth amount to three-odd ducats more Than I stand debted to this gentleman.
And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven, I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it.
Long stayed he so.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
What work is here, Charmian?
Thus have I politicly begun my reign, And ’tis my hope to end successfully.
Nor what I have done by water.
No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
I cannot love him.
I strike quickly, being moved.
Good night, my lord.
No, my fair cousin.
Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.
Their malady convinces The great assay of art, but at his touch— Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand— They presently amend.
That thing you speak of, I took it for a man.
O weary night, O long and tedious night, Abate thy hours.
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now To murder, murder our solemnity?
Honest, my lord?
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
Farewell.
O time’s extremity, Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue In seven short years that here my only son Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out, To let him live.
Swear your love.
Be better suited.
Tis true.
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
She is stirring, sir.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be.
Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
He that keeps nor crust nor crumb,  Weary of all, shall want some.
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.
Pardon not that.
This is his sword.
Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance.
Give me my sword.
Oh, a good wish upon you.
When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then To do this when I bade thee?
Caesar!
Stay not, be gone.
Why did you laugh then, when I said “man delights not me”?
Nay, I have offered all, I have no more, And she can have no more than all I have.
And Benedick is not the unhopefulest husband that I know.
The noble duke my master, My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.
But you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature’s best.
Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o’ th’ Nile By certain scales i’ th’ Pyramid.
And when I do, I swear It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, Rather than Paris.
More of this matter cannot I report.
After dinner Your hazard shall be made.
I stay too long.
Forbear, and eat no more.
O these deliberate fools!
Well, my good lord, I’ll do ’t.
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely.
I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be.
This night—wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, The lion and the belly-pinchèd wolf Keep their fur dry—unbonneted he runs, And bids what will take all.
Out on thee, seeming!
Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds?
What to him from England?
Of one whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe.
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Calling death “banishment,” Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
Hast thou the flower there?
Since I am crept in favor with myself, I will maintain it with some little cost.
Helena, adieu.
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, Pale in her anger, washes all the air, That rheumatic diseases do abound.
Thou naughty knave, what trade?
Thy mother’s poisoned.
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
I have it, Tranio!
Look with thine ears.
I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
They are wise and honorable, And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?— What’s this?
I fear ’tis choleric.
Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company.
The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn.
I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i' th' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th' afternoon.
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Tis certain.
If any bark put forth, come to the mart, Where I will walk till thou return to me.
Why do people love you?
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
He is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart.
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
An’t please your Majesty, ’tis the gage of one that I should fight withal, if he be alive.
If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk tonight already, He’ll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress' dog.
Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony.
It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
I will send for him, and question him yourself.
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham!
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
Not possible.
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well craves a kind of wit.
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.
Do you not remember he saw a flea stick upon Bardolph’s nose, and he said it was a black soul burning in hell?
Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness’ presence.
I pray you, is my master yet returned?
I will, lady.
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
Oh, relation Too nice and yet too true!
A blank, my lord.
Most certain, sir.
Were you made the messenger?
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse.
A man is master of his liberty; Time is their master, and when they see time They’ll go or come.
Tis nine o'clock.
Am I a coward?
I know she is an irksome brawling scold.
I pray you, see him presently discharged, For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.
Was ’t not the way?
What says Romeo?
What is it thou didst say?
Before you can say “Come” and “Go,” And breathe twice and cry “So, so!” Each one, tripping on his toe,
Your graces are right welcome.
How poor are they that have not patience!
Oh, how he loves Caesar!
O sweet bully Bottom!
But, for true need— You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need.
Believe me, no.
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord, And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt.
Some tardy cripple bear the countermand, That came too lag to see him burièd.
Assume a virtue if you have it not.
What did thy song bode, lady?
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup.
I have no food for thee.
There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else.
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer.
Say you so?
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain, And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character.
And indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting, and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase.
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
They are afoot.
An ’twere to me, I should be mad at it.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
Portia, forgive me this enforcèd wrong, And in the hearing of these many friends I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes Wherein I see myself—     Mark you but that!
Give me your arm.
Name Cleopatra as she is called in Rome.
But I do see you’re moved.
All this my sister is, or else should be.
Two things are to be done: My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.
Which way hast thou been?
And I am witness with her that she did.
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
They say there’s but five upon this isle.
Robin Starveling, the tailor?
Well, you temporize with the hours.
Soft, Caesar.
That ever holds.
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?
Take him hence.
These growing feathers plucked from Caesar’s wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch, Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
Heavens thank you for ’t!
Why?
I charge you, get you home.
Ghastly looks Are at my service, like enforcèd smiles, And both are ready in their offices, At any time to grace my stratagems.
These things to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline.
But as ’tis, We cannot miss him.
Sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions.
And they that are most gallèd with my folly, They most must laugh.
Which of them shall I take?
Tis like a demi-cannon.
Go you to him from me.
Farewell, sweet masters both.
If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son, He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks.
Therefore,  Go, clear thy crystals.—Yoke-fellows in arms, Let us to France, like horse-leeches, my boys, To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck.
The lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient.
If he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack Sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God’s ground and His earth, in my conscience, la.
You have not seen such a thing as ’tis.
If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way.
He tells me flatly there is no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter, and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.
She replied It should be better he became her guest, Which she entreated.
Where’s that mongrel?
Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
Where is he gone?
None, but your beauty.
When I think, I must speak.
And look when I am king, claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford, and all the moveables Whereof the king my brother was possessed.
How, how I pray you?
I would know that.
There will she hide her To listen our propose.
Read it, great Caesar.
I would not be mad.
O earth!
Never, my lord.
I did not give the lie.
My voice is in my sword.
All that I will tell you is that the duke hath dined.
After my death, the one half of my lands, And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person, How you awake our sleeping sword of war.
Let’s to billiards.
And, as the jest did glance away from me, 'Tis ten to one it maimed you two outright.
Anon!
Sir, this should be answered.
Thou art a fool.
Adieu, Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
Pray ye, go.
No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse?
God has given you one face and you make yourselves another.
Why, lady!
It is both he and she: Your son and daughter.
Why then, God’s soldier be he!
My tables!—Meet it is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him!
Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man.
Is it new and old too?
Do you know me, sir?
Caesar is touched.
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee.
No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you, For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom.
There be some such, no question.
Where is Metellus Cimber?
So do I, my lord.
Why, man, what is the matter?
If you will not, come when you are next prepared for.
I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown.
All the East, Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded, And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed, Who neighed so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumbed by him.
Let them play it.
I have no great devotion to the deed And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
That you did fear is done.
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights, Advance your standards.
Answer every man directly.
Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honor.
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.
You know no Centaur?
Sneck up!
O me!
No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.
You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will.
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
Come hither, fellow.
So dear I loved the man that I must weep.
Some god direct my judgment!
By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him.
Hear, Nature, hear, dear goddess, hear!

Let me endure your wrath, if ’t be not so.
Both, both, my girl.
Hark, they roar.
No, madam, he does nothing but smile.
Why, what should you fear?
I do remember me, Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be king, When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.
What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
I’ll put ’t in proof.
Follow, I pray you.
For three months, well.
Madam, here comes my lord.
Fore heaven, an excellent song.
None but friends.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
No, by no means.
When did she send thee?
Take heed you fall not.
Farewell, good Charles.
The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.
I never did deny it.
Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.
I’ll serve this duke.
It comes upon me.—Art thou any thing?
She made good view of me, indeed so much That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly.
If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
Tis strange.
Go, prick thy face and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-livered boy.
The French have reinforced their scattered men.
They must take it in sense that feel it.

If God will be avengèd for this deed, O, know you yet He doth it publicly!
We will haste us.
Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs.
And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad.
Tis clean out of the way.
My grandam told me he was murdered there.
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
But his flawed heart— Alack, too weak the conflict to support— 'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, Burst smilingly.
They have tied me to a stake.
Ay, good my lord.
That is the sum of all, Leonato.—Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.
And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?
Two deep enemies, Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep’s disturbers, Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Tonight I’ll mourn with Hero.
Farewell.
He faints!—My lord, my lord!

Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
O heavy deed!
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued To Cato’s daughter, Brutus' Portia.

Mistress,  Wilt thou still talk?
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
These griefs and losses have so bated me, That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.— Well, jailer, on.—Pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
I once more take my leave.
Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first?
Come on.
Well be with you, gentlemen.
Well, bawd I’ll turn, And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.

Make all the money thou canst.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.
World, world, O world!

If it pass against us, We lose the better half of our possession, For all the temporal lands which men devout By testament have given to the Church Would they strip from us, being valued thus: “As much as would maintain, to the King’s honor, Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, Six thousand and two hundred good esquires; And, to relief of lazars and weak age Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil, A hundred almshouses right well supplied; And to the coffers of the King besides, A thousand pounds by th' year.” Thus runs the bill.

I shall do ’t. 
Oh!
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
The next thing then she waking looks upon— Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, On meddling monkey or on busy ape— She shall pursue it with the soul of love.

Then I beat my tabor, At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their ears, Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses As they smelt music.
How?
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight.
And for my love I pray you wrong me not.
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you.
Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight, Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
Alexander, God knows and you know, in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.
You’ve said, sir.
